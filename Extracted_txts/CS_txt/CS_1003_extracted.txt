if int s[5] is a one-dimensional array of integers, which of the
following refers to the third element in the array?

9. *(s+2)
10. *(s +3)
ll. s+3
12.s+2

Attempt the following:

Write a program to copy the contents of one array into another
in the reverse order.

If an array arr contains n elements, then write a program to
check if arr[0] = arr[n-1], arr[1] = arr[n-2] and so on.

Find the smallest number in an array using pointers.
Write a program which performs the following tasks:

— initialize an integer array of 10 elements in main()

— pass the entire array to a function modify( )

— in modify() multiply each element of array by 3

— return the control to main() and print the new array
elements in main()

The screen is divided into 25 rows and 80 columns. The
characters that are displayed on the screen are stored in a
special memory called VDU memory (not to be confused with
ordinary memory). Each character displayed on the screen
occupies two bytes in VDU memory. The first of these bytes
contains the ASCII value of the character being displayed,
whereas, the second byte contains the colour in which the
character is displayed.

For example, the ASCII value of the character present on
zeroth row and zeroth column on the screen is stored at
