location number 0xB8000000. Therefore the colour of this
character would be present at location number 0xB8000000 +
1. Similarly ASCII value of character in row 0, col 1 will be at
location 0xB8000000 + 2, and its colour at 0xB8000000 + 3.

With this knowledge write a program which when executed
would keep converting every capital letter on the screen to
small case letter and every small case letter to capital letter.
The procedure should stop the moment the user hits a key
from the keyboard.

This is an activity of a rampant Virus called Dancing Dolls.
(For monochrome adapter, use 0xB0000000 instead of
0xB8000000).
