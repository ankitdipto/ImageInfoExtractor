Draw the boxes as shown above. Display the numbers in the
above order. Allow the user to hit any of the arrow keys (up,
down, left, or right).

If user hits say, right arrow key then the piece with a number
5 should move to the right and blank should replace the
original position of 5. Similarly, if down arrow key is hit, then
13 should move down and blank should replace the original
position of 13. If left arrow key or up arrow key is hit then no
action should be taken.

The user would continue hitting the arrow keys till the
numbers aren’t arranged in ascending order.

Keep track of the number of moves in which the user manages
to arrange the numbers in ascending order. The user who
manages it in minimum number of moves is the one who
wins.

How do we tackle the arrow keys? We cannot receive them
using scanf() function. Arrow keys are special keys which
are identified by their ‘scan codes’. Use the following
function in your program. It would return the scan code of the
arrow key being hit. Don’t worry about how this function is
written. We are going to deal with it later. The scan codes for
the arrow keys are:

up arrow key — 72 down arrow key — 80
left arrow key — 75 right arrow key — 77

/* Returns scan code of the key that has been hit */
#include "dos.h"
