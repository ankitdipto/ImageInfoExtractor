background may try writing programs for following problems.

(1) Write a program to add two 6 x 6 matrices.

(2) Write a program to multiply any two 3 x 3 matrices.

(3) Write a program to sort all the elements of a 4 x 4 matrix.

(4) Write a program to obtain the determinant value of a 5 x
5 matrix.

Match the following with reference to the following program
segment:

int i,j, = 25;

int *pi, *pj = & j:

. /* more lines of program */

  

Each integer quantity occupies 2 bytes of memory. The value
assigned to i begin at (hexadecimal) address F9C and the
value assigned to j begins at address F9E. Match the value
represented by left hand side quantities with the right.

1. &i a. 30
2 & b. F9E
3. pi c. 35
4 *pj d. FA2
