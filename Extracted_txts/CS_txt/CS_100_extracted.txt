Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Proof We can rewrite the flow-conservation condition for any node u € V —{s, tf}
as

Yo £000) — YO fw) = 0. (26.11)

vev vev

Taking the definition of | f'| from equation (26.1) and adding the left-hand side of
equation (26.11), which equals 0, summed over all vertices in S — {s}, gives

Ifl= do f6.y)-Yo fo.sy+ Yo (Sse9-Dsem).

veVv veVv ues—{s} \veV veV

Expanding the right-hand summation and regrouping terms yields

fl = LfoM-Vfoyt+ VV eavn- VY fo.w

 

veV veV ueS—{s} veV ueS—{s} veV
=> (ro +> fu.) -»y (i +> roo)
veVv ueS—{s} veV ueS—{s}
= VY fan-VYV sow.
veV ueS veV ueS

Because V = S UT and S NT = Q, we can split each summation over V into
summations over S and T to obtain

 

Il = SOO 4+ OY FW - VY LO. - YOY fo.)
veS ueS veT ueS veS ueS veT ueS
= VY fawy-YLY sow
veT ueS veT ueS
+ (LX m9 -LE row) .
veS ueS veS ueS

The two summations within the parentheses are actually the same, since for all
vertices x, y € V, the term f(x, y) appears once in each summation. Hence, these
summations cancel, and we have

fl = Ye fan sow
ueS veT ueS veT
= f(S,T). .

A corollary to Lemma 26.4 shows how we can use cut capacities to bound the
value of a flow.
