Write a function to find the norm of a matrix. The norm is
defined as the square root of the sum of squares of all
elements in the matrix.

(m) Given an array p[5], write a function to shift it circularly left

)

by two positions. Thus, if p[0] = 15, p[1]= 30, p[2] = 28,
p[3 19 and p[4] = 61 then after the shift p[0] = 28, p[1] =
19, p[2] = 61, p[3] = 15 and p[4] = 30. Call this function for a
(4x5 ) matrix and get its rows left shifted.

A 6x 6 matrix is entered through the keyboard and stored in a
2-dimensional array mat[7][7]. Write a program to obtain the
Determinant values of this matrix.

For the following set of sample data, compute the standard
deviation and the mean.

-6, -12, 8, 13, 11, 6, 7, 2, -6, -9, -10, 11, 10, 9, 2

The formula for standard deviation is

(x -x)

 

n

where x, is the data item and x is the mean.

The area of a triangle can be computed by the sine law when 2
sides of the triangle and the angle between them are known.

Area = (1/2) ab sin (angle)

Given the following 6 triangular pieces of land, write a
program to find their area and determine which is largest,

Plot No. a b angle
1 137.4 80.9 0.78
2 155.2 92.62 0.89

3 149.3 97.93 1.35
