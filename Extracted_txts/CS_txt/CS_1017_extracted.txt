sizes and dimensions, how to initialize arrays, how to pass

arrays to a function, etc. With this knowledge under your belt,
you should be ready to handle strings, which are, simply put, a
special kind of array. And strings, the ways to manipulate them,
and how pointers are related to strings are going to be the topics of
discussion in this chapter.

I: the last chapter you learnt how to define arrays of differing

What are Strings

The way a group of integers can be stored in an integer array,
similarly a group of characters can be stored in a character array.
Character arrays are many a time also called strings. Many
languages internally treat strings as character arrays, but somehow
conceal this fact from the programmer. Character arrays or strings
are used by programming languages to manipulate text such as
words and sentences.

A string constant is a one-dimensional array of characters
terminated by a null ( ‘\0’ ). For example,

    

char name[] = {'H’,'A’,'E','S','L,'E,'R', \0'};

Each character in the array occupies one byte of memory and the
last character is always ‘\0’. What character is this? It looks like
two characters, but it is actually only one character, with the \
indicating that what follows it is something special. ‘\0’ is called
null character. Note that ‘\0’ and ‘0’ are not same. ASCII value of
‘\0’ is 0, whereas ASCII value of ‘0’ is 48. Figure 9.1 shows the
way a character array is stored in memory. Note that the elements
of the character array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

The terminating null (‘\0’) is important, because it is the only way
the functions that work with a string can know where the string
ends. In fact, a string not terminated by a ‘\0’ is not really a string,
but merely a collection of characters.
