C concedes the fact that you would use strings very often and
hence provides a shortcut for initializing strings. For example, the
string used above can also be initialized as,

 

char name[] = "HAESLER";

Note that, in this declaration ‘\0’ is not necessary. C inserts the
null character automatically.

More about Strings

In what way are character arrays different than numeric arrays?
Can elements in a character array be accessed in the same way as
the elements of a numeric array? Do I need to take any special care
of ‘\0’? Why numeric arrays don’t end with a ‘\0’? Declaring
strings is okay, but how do I manipulate them? Questions galore!!
Well, let us settle some of these issues right away with the help of
sample programs.
