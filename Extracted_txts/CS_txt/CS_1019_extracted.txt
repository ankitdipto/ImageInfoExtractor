No big deal. We have initialized a character array, and then printed
out the elements of this array within a while loop. Can we write
the while loop without using the final value 7? We can; because
we know that each character array always ends with a ‘\0’.
Following program illustrates this.

main()
{
char name[] = "Klinsman" ;
int i=0;
while (namefi] != \0')
{
printf ( "%c", nameli] ) ;
i++;
}

}
And here is the output...
Klinsman

more general than the earlier one. Here is another version of the
same program; this one uses a pointer to access the array elements.

main()

{
char name[] = "Klinsman" ;
char “ptr;
