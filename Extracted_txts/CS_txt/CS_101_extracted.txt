Corollary 26.5
The value of any flow f ina flow network G is bounded from above by the capacity
of any cut of G.

Proof Let (S,T) be any cut of G and let f be any flow. By Lemma 26.4 and the
capacity constraint,

Corollary 26.5 yields the immediate consequence that the value of a maximum
flow in a network is bounded from above by the capacity of a minimum cut of
the network. The important max-flow min-cut theorem, which we now state and
prove, says that the value of a maximum flow is in fact equal to the capacity of a
minimum cut.

Theorem 26.6 (Max-flow min-cut theorem)

If f is a flow ina flow network G = (V, £) with source s and sink f, then the
following conditions are equivalent:

1. f isa maximum flow in G.

2. The residual network Gy contains no augmenting paths.

3. |f| =c(S,T) for some cut (S,T) of G.

Proof (1) => (2): Suppose for the sake of contradiction that f is a maximum
flow in G but that Gy has an augmenting path p. Then, by Corollary 26.3, the
flow found by augmenting f by fp, where fp is given by equation (26.8), is a flow
in G with value strictly greater than | f'|, contradicting the assumption that f is a
maximum flow.

(2) = (3): Suppose that Gy has no augmenting path, that is, that Gy contains
no path from s tof. Define

S = {v €V: there exists a path from s to v in Gr}

and T = V — S. The partition (S, 7) is a cut: we have s € S trivially andt ¢ S
because there is no path from s to ¢ in Gy. Now consider a pair of vertices
