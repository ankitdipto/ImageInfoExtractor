332 Let Us C

 

Even though there are so many ways (as shown above) to refer to
the elements of a character array, rarely is any one of them used.
This is because printf() function has got a sweet and simple way
of doing it, as shown below. Note that printf() doesn’t print the
‘\0’.

main()

{
char name[] = "Klinsman" ;
printf ("%s", name ) ;

The %s used in printf() is a format specification for printing out a
string. The same specification can be used to receive a string from
the keyboard, as shown below.

main()
{
char name[25] ;

printf (“Enter your name ") ;

scanf ("%s", name ) ;

printf ("Hello %s!", name ) ;
}

And here is a sample run of the program...

Enter your name Debashish
Hello Debashish!

Note that the declaration char name[25] sets aside 25 bytes under
the array name[], whereas the scanf() function fills in the
characters typed at keyboard into this array until the enter key is
hit. Once enter is hit, scanf() places a ‘\0’ in the array. Naturally,
we should pass the base address of the array to the scanf()
function.
