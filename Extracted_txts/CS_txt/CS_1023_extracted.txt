Chapter 9: Puppetting On Strings 333

 

While entering the string using scanf( ) we must be cautious about
two things:

(a)

()

The length of the string should not exceed the dimension of
the character array. This is because the C compiler doesn’t
perform bounds checking on character arrays. Hence, if you
carelessly exceed the bounds there is always a danger of
overwriting something important, and in that event, you
would have nobody to blame but yourselves.

scanf() is not capable of receiving multi-word strings.
Therefore names such as ‘Debashish Roy’ would be
unacceptable. The way to get around this limitation is by
using the function gets(). The usage of functions gets() and
its counterpart puts() is shown below.

main()
char name[25] ;

printf (“Enter your full name " ) ;
gets (name) ;
puts ( "Hello!" ) ;
puts (name) ;
}

And here is the output...

Enter your name Debashish Roy
Hello!
Debashish Roy

The program and the output are self-explanatory except for
the fact that, puts() can display only one string at a time
(hence the use of two puts() in the program above). Also, on
displaying a string, unlike printf(), puts() places the cursor
on the next line. Though gets() is capable of receiving only
