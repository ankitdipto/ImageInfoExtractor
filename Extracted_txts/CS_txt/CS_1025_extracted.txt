334 Let Us C

 

one string at a time, the plus point with gets() is that it can
receive a multi-word string.

If we are prepared to take the trouble we can make scanf( )
accept multi-word strings by writing it in this manner:

char name[25] ;
printf ( "Enter your full name ") ;
scanf ("%[*\n]s", name ) ;

Though workable this is the best of the ways to call a
function, you would agree.

Pointers and Strings

Suppose we wish to store “Hello”. We may either store it in a
string or we may ask the C compiler to store it at some location in
memory and assign the address of the string in a char pointer. This
is shown below:

char str[] = "Hello" ;
char “p= "Hello" ;

There is a subtle difference in usage of these two forms. For
example, we cannot assign a string to another, whereas, we can
assign a char pointer to another char pointer. This is shown in the
following program.

main()

{
char str1[] = "Hello" ;
char str2[10] ;

char *s = "Good Morning’ ;
char *q;
