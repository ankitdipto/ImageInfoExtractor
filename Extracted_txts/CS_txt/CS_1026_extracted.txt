str2 = str1 ;/* error “/
q=s;/* works */
}

Also, once a string has been defined it cannot be initialized to
another set of characters. Unlike strings, such an operation is
perfectly valid with char pointers.

main()

{
char str1[] = "Hello" ;
char “p= "Hello" ;
str] = "Bye" ; /* error */
p = "Bye" ; /* works */
