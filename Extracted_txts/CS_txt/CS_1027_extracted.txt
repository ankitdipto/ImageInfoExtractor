Out of the above list we shall discuss the functions strlen(),
strepy(), strcat() and stremp(), since these are the most
commonly used functions. This will also illustrate how the library
functions in general handle strings. Let us study these functions
one by one.

strlen()

This function counts the number of characters present in a string.
Its usage is illustrated in the following program.

main()

char arr[] = "Bamboozled" ;
int lent, len2 ;
