xstrlen (char *s)

{
int length = 0;
while (*s != \0')
{
length++ ;
St+}
}
return (length ) ;
}

The output would be...

string = Bamboozled length = 10
string = Humpty Dumpty length = 13

The function xstrlen() is fairly simple. All that it does is keep
counting the characters till the end of string is not met. Or in other
words keep counting characters till the pointer s doesn’t point to
‘\0’.

strepy()

This function copies the contents of one string into another. The
base addresses of the source and target strings should be supplied
to this function. Here is an example of strepy( ) in action...

main()

char source[ ] = "Sayonara" ;
