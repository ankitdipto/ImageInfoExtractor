Chapter 9: Puppetting On Strings 339

 

char target[20] ;

strcpy (target, source ) ;
printf ( "\nsource string = %s", source ) ;
printf ( “\ntarget string = %s", target ) ;

}

And here is the output...

source string = Sayonara
target string = Sayonara

On supplying the base addresses, strepy() goes on copying the
characters in source string into the target string till it doesn't
encounter the end of source string (‘\0’). It is our responsibility to
see to it that the target string’s dimension is big enough to hold the
string being copied into it. Thus, a string gets copied into another,
piece-meal, character by character. There is no short cut for this.
Let us now attempt to mimic strepy(), via our own string copy
function, which we will call xstrepy().

main()

{
char source[] = "Sayonara" ;
char target[20] ;

xstrcpy (target, source ) ;
printf ( "\nsource string = %s", source ) ;
printf ( “\ntarget string = %s", target ) ;

}
xstrcpy (char “t, char *s )
{

while ( *s !=‘\0")

{

‘t="s;
