340 Let Us C

 

The output of the program would be...

source string = Sayonara
target string = Sayonara

Note that having copied the entire source string into the target
string, it is necessary to place a ‘\0’ into the target string, to mark
its end.

If you look at the prototype of strepy( ) standard library function,
it looks like this...

strepy (char “t, const char *s ) ;
We didn’t use the keyword const in our version of xstrepy() and
still our function worked correctly. So what is the need of the

const qualifier?

What would happen if we add the following lines beyond the last
statement of xstrepy()?.

 

This would change the source string to “Kayonara”. Can we not
ensure that the source string doesn’t change even accidentally in
xstrepy()? We can, by changing the definition as follows:

void xstrcpy (char “t, const char “s )

while (*s != \0')
{
