By declaring char *s as const we are declaring that the source
string should remain constant (should not change). Thus the const
qualifier ensures that your program does not inadvertently alter a
variable that you intended to be a constant. It also reminds
anybody reading the program listing that the variable is not
intended to change.

We can use const in several situations. The following code
fragment would help you to fix your ideas about const further.

 

const char *q = "Hello" ; /* string is fixed pointer is not */
“q= I error */
q = "Bye"; /* works */

char const *s = "Hello" ; /* string is fixed pointer is not */
“s='M; I error */

s = "Bye"; /* works */

char * const t = "Hello" ; /* pointer is fixed string is not */
“t='M; /* works */

t= "Bye"; /* error */

 

const char * const u = "Hello" ; /* string is fixed so is pointer “/
“‘u='M; error “/
u = "Bye" ; /* error */
