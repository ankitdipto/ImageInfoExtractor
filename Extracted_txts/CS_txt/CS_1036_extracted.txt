Chapter 9: Puppetting On Strings 343

 

Note that the target string has been made big enough to hold the
final string. I leave it to you to develop your own xstreat() on
lines of xstrlen() and xstrepy().

stremp()

This is a function which compares two strings to find out whether
they are same or different. The two strings are compared character
by character until there is a mismatch or end of one of the strings
is reached, whichever occurs first. If the two strings are identical,
stremp() returns a value zero. If they’re not, it returns the numeric
difference between the ASCII values of the first non-matching
pairs of characters. Here is a program which puts stremp() in
action.

main()

{
char string1[] = "Jerry" ;
char string2[] = "Ferry" ;
int i,j,k;

i = stremp (string1, “Jerry” ) ;
j= strcmp (string1, string2 ) ;
k = strcmp (string1, “Jerry boy" ) ;

printf ( "\n%d %d %d", i,j, kK) ;
}

And here is the output...

In the first call to stremp(), the two strings are identical—‘Jerry”
and “Jerry”—and the value returned by stremp() is zero. In the
second call, the first character of “Jerry” doesn't match with the
first character of “Ferry” and the result is 4, which is the numeric
