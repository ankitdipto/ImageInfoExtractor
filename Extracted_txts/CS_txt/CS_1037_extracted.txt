344 Let Us C

 

difference between ASCII value of ‘J’ and ASCII value of ‘F’. In
the third call to stremp() “Jerry” doesn’t match with “Jerry boy”,
because the null character at the end of “Jerry” doesn’t match the
blank in “Jerry boy”. The value returned is -32, which is the value
of null character minus the ASCII value of space, i.e., ‘\0’ minus
*? which is equal to -32.

The exact value of mismatch will rarely concern us. All we usually
want to know is whether or not the first string is alphabetically
before the second string. If it is, a negative value is returned; if it
isn’t, a positive value is returned. Any non-zero value means there
is a mismatch. Try to implement this procedure into a function
xstremp().

Two-Dimensional Array of Characters

In the last chapter we saw several examples of 2-dimensional
integer arrays. Let’s now look at a similar entity, but one dealing
with characters. Our example program asks you to type your name.
When you do so, it checks your name against a master list to see if
you are worthy of entry to the palace. Here’s the program...

#define FOUND 1

#define NOTFOUND 0

main()

char masterlist[6][10] = {

“akshay’,
“parag’,
“raman",
“srinivas”,
“gopal",
"rajesh"

int i, flag, a;
char yourname[10] ;
