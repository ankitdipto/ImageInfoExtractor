Chapter 9: Puppetting On Strings 345

 

printf ( "\nEnter your name ") ;
scanf ("%s", yourname ) ;

flag = NOTFOUND ;
for (i=0;i1<=5; i++)

{
a = strcmp ( &masterlist{i][0], yourname ) ;
if(a==0)
{
printf ( "Welcome, you can enter the palace" ) ;
flag = FOUND ;
break ;
}
}

if ( flag =- NOTFOUND )
printf ( "Sorry, you are a trespasser” ) ;

And here is the output for two sample runs of this program...

Enter your name dinesh

Sorry, you are a trespasser

Enter your name raman

Welcome, you can enter the palace

Notice how the two-dimensional character array has been
initialized. The order of the subscripts in the array declaration is
important. The first subscript gives the number of names in the
array, while the second subscript gives the length of each item in
the array.

Instead of initializing names, had these names been supplied from
the keyboard, the program segment would have looked like this...

for (i=0;i i++)
scanf ("%s", &masterlist[i][0] ) ;
