346 Let Us C

 

While comparing the strings through stremp(), note that the
addresses of the strings are being passed to stremp(). As seen in
the last section, if the two strings match, stremp() would return a
value 0, otherwise it would return a non-zero value.

The variable flag is used to keep a record of whether the control
did reach inside the if or not. To begin with, we set flag to
NOTFOUND. Later through the loop if the names match, flag is
set to FOUND. When the control reaches beyond the for loop, if
flag is still set to NOTFOUND, it means none of the names in the
masterlist[ ][ ] matched with the one supplied from the keyboard.

The names would be stored in the memory as shown in Figure 9.3.
Note that each string ends with a ‘\0’. The arrangement as you can
appreciate is similar to that of a two-dimensional numeric array.
