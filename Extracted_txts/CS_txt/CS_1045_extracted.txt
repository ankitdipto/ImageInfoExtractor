Limitation of Array of Pointers to Strings

When we are using a two-dimensional array of characters we are
at liberty to either initialize the strings where we are declaring the
array, or receive the strings using scanf() function. However,
when we are using an array of pointers to strings we can initialize
the strings at the place where we are declaring the array, but we
cannot receive the strings from keyboard using scanf(). Thus, the
following program would never work out.

main()

{
char “*names|6] ;
int i;

for (i=0;i<=5; i++)

{
printf ("\nEnter name " ) ;
scanf ("%s", names|i] ) ;

}

The program doesn’t work because; when we are declaring the
array it is containing garbage values. And it would be definitely
wrong to send these garbage values to scanf() as the addresses
where it should keep the strings received from the keyboard.

Solution

If we are bent upon receiving the strings from keyboard using
scanf() and then storing their addresses in an array of pointers to
strings we can do it in a slightly round about manner as shown
below.

#include "alloc.h"
main()
