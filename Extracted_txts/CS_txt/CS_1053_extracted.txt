“Spit and polish",
"You and C"
hi

Can an array of pointers to strings be used to collect strings
from the keyboard? If not, why not?

Attempt the following:

Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str[ ].
Receive two strings str1 and str2 and check if str1 is
embedded in any of the strings in str[ ]. If str] is found, then
replace it with str2.

char “str[] = {
“We will teach you how to...",
“Move a mountain",
“Level a building’,
“Erase the past’,
“Make a million",
",.all through C!"

bs

For example if str1 contains "mountain" and str2 contains
"car", then the second string in str should get changed to
"Move a car".

Write a program to sort a set of names stored in an array in
alphabetical order.

Write a program to reverse the strings stored in the following
array of pointers to strings:

char “s[]= {
"To ert is human...",
“But to really mess things up...",
"One needs to know C!!"
