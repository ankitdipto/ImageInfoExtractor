Chapter 7. First-Order Logic

 

SYNTACTIC SUGAR

7. An object is a member of the intersection of two sets if and only if it is a member of each
of the sets.
Vx,51,52 Member(x, Intersection(s),82)) &
Member(x,s,) A Member(x,s2)

8. An object is a member of the union of two sets ifand only ifit is a member of either set.

Wx,51,52 Member(x, Union(s,, 52))
Member(x,s;) V Member(x,s2)

The domain of lists is very similar to the domain of sets. The difference is that lists are ordered,
and the same element can appear more than once ina list. We can use the vocabulary of Lisp for
lists: Nil is the constant list with no elements; Cons, Append, First, and Rest are functions; and
Find is the predicate that does for lists what Member does for sets. List? is a predicate that is true
only of lists. Exercise 7.8 asks you to write axioms for the list domain.

Special notations for sets, lists and arithmetic

Because sets and lists are so common, and because there is a well-defined mathematical notation
for them, it is tempting to extend the syntax of first-order logic to include this mathematical
notation. The important thing to remember is that when this is done, it is only a change to the
syntax of the language; it does not change the semantics. The notation is just an abbreviation
for the normal first-order logic notation. Such notational extensions are often called syntactic
sugar. We will use standard mathematical notation for arithmetic and set theory from here on,
and will also use the nonstandard notation {as} as an abbreviationfor Adjoin(as). There is less
consensus among mathematicians about the notation for lists; we have chosen the notation used
by Prolog:

 

 

0 = EmphSet f] = Nil
{x} = Adjoin(x EmptySet) [x] = Cons(x, Nil)
{x,y} = Adjoin(x, Adjoin(EmptySet)) [x,y] = Cons(x, Cons(y, Nil)
{ays} = Adjoin(x, Adjoin(y,s)) [x yl] = Cons(x, Cons(y,/))
rUs â€” Union(rs)
rns = Intersection(r,s)
xES Member(x,s)

rCs = Subset(r,s)

We will also use standard arithmetic notation in logical sentences, saying, for example, x > 0
instead of >(x, Zero) and 1+2 instead of +(1,2). It should be understood that each use of an infix
mathematical operator is just an abbreviation for a standard prefix predicate or function. The
integers are used as constant symbols, with their usual interpretation.

Asking questions and getting answers

Although we will delay discussion of the intemals of TELL and ASK until chapters 9 and 10, it
is important to understand how they are used in first-order logic. If we want to add the kinship
