be single character long. Let us begin with a program that uses
arrays.

main()

{
char name{3] ;
float price[3] ;
int pages[3}, i;

printf ( "\nEnter names, prices and no. of pages of 3 books\n") ;

for (i=0;i<=2; i++)
scant ("%c %f %d", &nameli], &priceli], &pagesfi] );

printf ( "\nAnd this is what you enteredin" ) ;
for (i=0;i<=2; i++)
printf ("%c %f %d\n", nameli], pricefi], pages|i] );
}

And here is the sample run...

Enter names, prices and no. of pages of 3 books
A 100.00 354
C 256.50 682
F 233.70 512

And this is what you entered
A 100.000000 354
C 256.500000 682
F 233.700000 512

This approach no doubt allows you to store names, prices and
number of pages. But as you must have realized, it is an unwieldy
approach that obscures the fact that you are dealing with a group
of characteristics related to a single entityâ€”the book.
