366 Let Us C

 

The program becomes more difficult to handle as the number of
items relating to the book go on increasing. For example, we
would be required to use a number of arrays, if we also decide to
store name of the publisher, date of purchase of book, etc. To solve
this problem, C provides a special data type—the structure.

A structure contains a number of data types grouped together.
These data types may or may not be of the same type. The
following example illustrates the use of this data type.

main()
{
struct book
{
char name ;
float price ;
int pages ;

struct book b1, b2, b3;

printf ( "\nEnter names, prices & no. of pages of 3 books\n" ) ;
scanf ("%c %f %d", &b1.name, &b1.price, &b1.pages ) ;
scanf ("%c %f %d", &b2.name, &b2.price, &b2.pages ) ;
scanf ("%c %f %d", &b3.name, &b3.price, &b3.pages ) ;

printf
printf
printf
printf

“\nAnd this is what you entered” ) ;

“\n%c %f %d", b1.name, b1.price, b1.pages ) ;
“\n%c %f %d", b2.name, b2.price, b2.pages ) ;
“\n%c %f %d", b3.name, b3.price, b3.pages ) ;

}
And here is the output...

Enter names, prices and no. of pages of 3 books
A 100.00 354
C 256.50 682
F 233.70 512
