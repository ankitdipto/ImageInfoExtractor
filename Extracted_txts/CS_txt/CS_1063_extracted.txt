This program demonstrates two fundamental aspects of structures:

(a) declaration of a structure
(b) accessing of structure elements

Let us now look at these concepts one by one.
Declaring a Structure

In our example program, the following statement declares the
structure type:

struct book

{
char name ;
float price ;
int pages ;

};

This statement defines a new data type called struct book. Each
variable of this data type will consist of a character variable called
name, a float variable called price and an integer variable called
pages. The general form of a structure declaration statement is
given below:

struct <structure name>
{
structure element 1 ;
structure element 2 ;
structure element 3 ;
