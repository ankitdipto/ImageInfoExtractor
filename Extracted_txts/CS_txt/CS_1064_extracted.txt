368 Let Us C

 

hi

Once the new structure data type has been defined one or more
variables can be declared to be of that type. For example the
variables b1, b2, b3 can be declared to be of the type struct book,
as.

struct book b1, b2, b3 ;

This statement sets aside space in memory. It makes available
space to hold all the elements in the structure—in this case, 7
bytes—one for name, four for price and two for pages. These
bytes are always in adjacent memory locations.

If we so desire, we can combine the declaration of the structure
type and the structure variables in one statement.

For example,

struct book

{
char name ;
float price ;
int pages ;

struct book b1, b2, b3 ;
is same as...

struct book

{
char name ;
float price ;
int pages ;

}b1, b2, b3 ;

or even...

struct
