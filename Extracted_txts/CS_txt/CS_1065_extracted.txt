Chapter 10: Structures 369

 

{
char name ;
float price ;
int pages ;
}b1, b2, b3;

Like primary variables and arrays, structure variables can also be
initialized where they are declared. The format used is quite
similar to that used to initiate arrays.

struct book

{
char name[10] ;
float price ;
int pages ;

struct book b1 = { "Basic", 130.00, 550 };
struct book b2 = { "Physics", 150.80, 800 } ;

Note the following points while declaring a structure type:

(a) The closing brace in the structure type declaration must be
followed by a semicolon.

(b) It is important to understand that a structure type declaration
does not tell the compiler to reserve any space in memory. All
a structure declaration does is, it defines the ‘form’ of the
structure.

(c) Usually structure type declaration appears at the top of the
source code file, before any variables or functions are defined.
In very large programs they are usually put in a separate
header file, and the file is included (using the preprocessor
directive #include) in whichever program we want to use this
structure type.
