Accessing Structure Elements

Having declared the structure type and the structure variables, let
us see how the elements of the structure can be accessed.

In arrays we can access individual elements of an array using a
subscript. Structures use a different scheme. They use a dot (.)
operator. So to refer to pages of the structure defined in our
sample program we have to use,

b1.pages

Similarly, to refer to price we would use,

b1.price

Note that before the dot there must always be a structure variable
and after the dot there must always be a structure element.

How Structure Elements are Stored
Whatever be the elements of a structure, they are always stored in
contiguous memory locations. The following program would

illustrate this:

/* Memory map of structure elements */

main()
{
struct book
{
char name ;
float price ;

int pages ;
struct book b1 = {'Bâ€™, 130.00, 550};

printf ( "\nAddress of name = %u", &b1.name ) ;
