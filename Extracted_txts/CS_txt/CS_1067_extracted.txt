Chapter 10: Structures 371

 

printf ( "\nAddress of price = %u", &b1.price ) ;
printf ( "\nAddress of pages = %u", &b1.pages ) ;
}

Here is the output of the program...

Address of name = 65518
Address of price = 65519
Address of pages = 65523

Actually the structure elements are stored in memory as shown in
the Figure 10.1.

Array of Structures

Our sample program showing usage of structure is rather simple
minded. All it does is, it receives values into various structure
elements and output these values. But that’s all we intended to do
anyway... show how structure types are created, how structure
variables are declared and how individual elements of a structure
variable are referenced.

In our sample program, to store data of 100 books we would be
required to use 100 different structure variables from b1 to b100,
which is definitely not very convenient. A better approach would
be to use an array of structures. Following program shows how to
use an array of structures.
