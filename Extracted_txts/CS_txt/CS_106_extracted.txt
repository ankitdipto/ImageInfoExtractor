26.2. The Ford-Fulkerson method 727

 

Figure 26.6, continued (f) The residual network at the last while loop test. It has no augmenting
paths, and the flow f shown in (e) is therefore a maximum flow, The value of the maximum flow
found is 23.

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm

We can improve the bound on FORD-FULKERSON by finding the augmenting
path p in line 3 with a breadth-first search. That is, we choose the augmenting
path as a shortest path from s to f in the residual network, where each edge has
unit distance (weight). We call the Ford-Fulkerson method so implemented the
Edmonds-Karp algorithm. We now prove that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm runs
in O(VE7) time.

The analysis depends on the distances to vertices in the residual network Gy.
The following lemma uses the notation 5¢(u.v) for the shortest-path distance
from u to v in Gy, where each edge has unit distance.

Lemma 26.7

If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a flow network G = (V, E) with source 5
and sink f, then for all vertices v € V — {s,f}, the shortest-path distance 5r(s, v)
in the residual network Gy increases monotonically with each flow augmentation.
