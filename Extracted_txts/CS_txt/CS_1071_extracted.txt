208 — cHAFTERSIX Programming the Basic Computer

‘The service routine performs the six tasks mentioned above. The antents
of AC and E are stored in special locations. (These are the only processor
registers in the basic computer.) The flags are checked sequentially, the input
flag first and the output flag second. If any or both flags are set, an item of data
is transferred to or from the corresponding memory buffer. Before returning
to the running program the previous eontents of E and AC are restuxed and
the interrupt facility is turned on. The last instruction causes a branch to the
address stored in location 0. This is the return addrese stored there previously
during the interrupt cycle. Hence the cunning program will continue from
location 104, where it was interrupted.

A typical computer may have many more input and output devices
connected to the interrupt facility. Furthermore, interrupt soustes are not
limited to input and output transfers. interrupts can be used for other pur-
poses, such as interna) processing errors or speci) alarm conditions. Further
discussion of interrupts and some advanced concepts concerning this impor-
tant subject can be found in Sec. 11-5.
