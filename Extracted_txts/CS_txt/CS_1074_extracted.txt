374 Let Us C

 

scanf( ) and atof( ). There are some cases in which the
reference to the float is a bit obscure and the compiler does
not detect the need for the emulator. The most common is
using scanf( ) to read a float in an array of structures as
shown in our program.

How can we force the formats to be linked? Thatâ€™s where the
linkfloat( ) function comes in. It forces linking of the
floating-point emulator into an application. There is no need
to call this function, just define it anywhere in your program.

Additional Features of Structures

Let us now explore the intricacies of structures with a view of
programming convenience. We would highlight these intricacies
with suitable examples:

(a) The values of a structure variable can be assigned to another
structure variable of the same type using the assignment
operator. It is not necessary to copy the structure elements
piece-meal. Obviously, programmers prefer assignment to
piece-meal copying. This is shown in the following example.

main()
{
struct employee
{
char namef[10] ;
int age ;
float salary ;

struct employee e1 = { "Sanjay", 30, 5500.50} ;
struct employee 2, e3 ;

/* piece-meal copying */
strcpy (e2.name, e1.name) ;
e2.age = e1.age ;
