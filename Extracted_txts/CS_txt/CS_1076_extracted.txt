376 Let Us C

 

{
char phone[15] ;
char city[25] ;
int pin;

hi

struct emp

{

char name[25] ;
struct address a;
hi
struct emp e = {“jeru", "531046", "nagpur", 10 };

printf ( "\nname = %s phone = %s", e.name, e.a.phone ) ;
printf ( “\ncity = %s pin = %d", e.a.city, e.a.pin ) ;
}

And here is the output...

name = jeru phone = 531046
city = nagpur pin = 10

Notice the method used to access the element of a structure
that is part of another structure. For this the dot operator is
used twice, as in the expression,

e.a.pin or e.a.city

Of course, the nesting process need not stop at this level. We
can nest a structure within a structure, within another
structure, which is in still another structure and so on... till the
time we can comprehend the structure ourselves. Such
construction however gives rise to variable names that can be
surprisingly self descriptive, for example:

maruti.engine. bolt.large.qty
