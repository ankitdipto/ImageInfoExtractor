Chapter 10: Structures 377

 

()

This clearly signifies that we are referring to the quantity of
large sized bolts that fit on an engine of a maruti car.

Like an ordinary variable, a structure variable can also be
passed to a function. We may either pass individual structure
elements or the entire structure variable at one go. Let us
examine both the approaches one by one using suitable
programs.

/" Passing individual structure elements */
main()
{
struct book
{
char name[25] ;
char author[25] ;
int callno ;
};
struct book b1 = { "Let us C", "YPK", 101};

display (b1.name, b1.author, b1.callno ) ;
}

display (char *s, char *t, int n)
{

printf ( "\n%s %s %d", s, tn);
}

And here is the output...

Letus C YPK 101

Observe that in the declaration of the structure, name and
author have been declared as arrays. Therefore, when we call

the function display() using,

display (b1.name, b1.author, b1.callno ) ;
