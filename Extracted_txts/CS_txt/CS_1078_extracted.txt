378 Let Us C

 

we are passing the base addresses of the arrays name and
author, but the value stored in callno. Thus, this is a mixed
callâ€”a call by reference as well as a call by value.

It can be immediately realized that to pass individual elements
would become more tedious as the number of structure
elements go on increasing. A better way would be to pass the
entire structure variable at a time. This method is shown in the
following program.

struct book

{
char name[25] ;
char author[25] ;

int callno ;

hi

main()

{
struct book b1 = { "Let us C", "YPK", 101};
display (b1) ;

display ( struct book b )
{

printf ( "\n%s %s %d", b.name, b.author, b.callno ) ;
}

And here is the output...
Let us C YPK 101

Note that here the calling of function display( ) becomes quite
compact,

display ( b1) ;
