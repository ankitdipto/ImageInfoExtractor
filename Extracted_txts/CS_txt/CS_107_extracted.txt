Figure 26.7 (a) A flow network for which FORD-FULKERSON can take @(E | f*|) time,
where f* is a maximum flow, shown here with |/*] = 2,000,000. The shaded path is an aug-
menting path with residual capacity 1. (b) The resulting residual network, with another augmenting
path whose residual capacity is 1. (c) The resulting residual network.

Proof We will suppose that for some vertex v € V — {s.r}, there is a flow aug-
mentation that causes the shortest-path distance from s to v to decrease, and then
we will derive a contradiction. Let f be the flow just before the first augmentation
that decreases some shortest-path distance, and let f’ be the flow just afterward.
Let v be the vertex with the minimum 4;/(s, v) whose distance was decreased by
the augmentation, so that 6f/(s,v) < 5¢(s,v). Let p = s ~ u > v bea shortest
path from s to v in Gy, so that (u,v) € Ey and

bp(s.u) = d¢(s,v)—1. (26.12)
Because of how we chose v, we know that the distance of vertex u from the source 5
did not decrease, i.e.,

5p(8,u) = bf (s,u). (26.13)
We claim that (u,v) ¢ Ey. Why? If we had (u,v) € Ey, then we would also have
5(s.v) < 8¢(s,u) +1 (by Lemma 24.10, the triangle inequality)

5¢-(s,u) +1 (by inequality (26.13))

5p (8. v) (by equation (26.12)) ,

which contradicts our assumption that 5¢/(s,v) < 5¢(s,v).

How can we have (u,v) ¢ Ey and (u,v) € Ey? The augmentation must
have increased the flow from v to u. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm always aug-
ments flow along shortest paths, and therefore the shortest path from s to u in Gy
has (v, u) as its last edge. Therefore,

5p(s.v) = d¢(s.u)—1
5(s,u) — 1 (by inequality (26.13))
5¢-(s,v) —2 (by equation (26.12)) ,
