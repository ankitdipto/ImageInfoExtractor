380 Let Us C

 

operator requires a structure variable on its left. In such cases
C provides an operator ->, called an arrow operator to refer to
the structure elements. Remember that on the left hand side of
the ‘.’ structure operator, there must always be a structure
variable, whereas on the left hand side of the ‘->’ operator
there must always be a pointer to a structure. The arrangement
of the structure variable and pointer to structure in memory is
shown in the Figure 10.2.

Can we not pass the address of a structure variable to a
function? We can. The following program demonstrates this.

/" Passing address of a structure variable */
struct book

{
char name[25] ;
char author[25] ;
int callno ;

hi

main()

{

struct book b1 ={"Let us C", "YPK", 101};
display ( &b1) ;
