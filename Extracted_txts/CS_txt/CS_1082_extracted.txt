}
display (struct book “b )
{

printf ( "\n%s %s %d", b->name, b->author, b->callno ) ;
}

And here is the output...
Letus C YPK 101

Again note that to access the structure elements using pointer
to a structure we have to use the ‘->’ operator.

Also, the structure struct book should be declared outside
main( ) such that this data type is available to display() while
declaring pointer to the structure.

Consider the following code snippet:

struct emp
{
inta ;
char ch ;
float s ;
};
struct emp e ;
printf ("%u %u %u", &e.a, &e.ch, &e.S ) ;

If we execute this program using TC/TC++ compiler we get
the addresses as:

65518 65520 65521

As expected, in memory the char begins immediately after
the int and float begins immediately after the char.
