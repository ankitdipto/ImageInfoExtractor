List the assembly language program (of the equivalent binary instructions)
generated by a compiler froin the following Fortran program. Assume in-
teger variables.

SUM =0
SUM=SUN+A+B
DIF =DIF-C

SUM = SUM + DIP

 

Can the letter‘I be used as a symbolic address in the assembly language
Program defined for the basic computer? Justify the answer.

‘What happens during the first pass of the assembler (Fig. 6-1) ifthe line of
code that has a pseudoinstruction ORG or END also has a label? Modify the
flowchart to include an error message if this occurs.

Alline of code in an assembly language program is as follows
DEC -35

a. Show that four memory words are required to store the line of code and
give their binary content.

” b: Show that one memory word stores the binary translated code and give

its binary content.

a. Obtain the address symbal table generated for the program of Table 6-13,
during the first pass of the assembler.

. List the translated program in hexadecimal.

‘The pseudoinstruction BSS N (block started by symbol) is sometimes em-

ployed to reserve N memory words for a group of operands. For example,

the line of code

, A, BSS 10
informs the assembler that a block of 10 (decimal) locations is to be left free,
starting from location A. This is similar to the Fortran statement DIMEN-
SION A(10). Modify the flowchart of Fig. 6-1 to process this pseudoinstruc-
tion.
