above applications. Some of these applications would be discussed
in Chapters 16 to 19.

Summary

(a) A structure is usually used when we wish to store dissimilar
data together.

(b) Structure elements can be accessed through a structure
variable using a dot (.) operator.

(c) Structure elements can be accessed through a pointer to a
structure using the arrow (->) operator.

(d) All elements of one structure variable can be assigned to
another structure variable using the assignment (=) operator.

(e) It is possible to pass a structure variable to a function either
by value or by address.

(f) It is possible to create an array of structures.

Exercise

[A] What would be the output of the following programs:
(a) main()

{
struct gospel
{
int num ;
char mess1[50] ;
char mess2[50] ;
ym;

m.num = 1 ;
strcpy (m.messt, "If all that you have is hammer" ) ;
strcpy (m.mess2, "Everything looks like a nail" ) ;

/* assume that the strucure is located at address 1004 */
printf ("\n%u %u %u", &m.num, m.mess1, m.mess2 ) ;
