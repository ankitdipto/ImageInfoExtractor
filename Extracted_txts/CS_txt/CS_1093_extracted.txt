Create a structure called library to hold accession number,
title of the book, author name, price of the book, and flag
indicating whether book is issued or not.

Write a program that compares two given dates. To store date
use structure say date that contains three members namely
date, month and year. If the dates are equal then display
message as "Equal" otherwise "Unequal".

Linked list is a very common data structure often used to store
similar data in memory. While the elements of an array
occupy contiguous memory locations, those of a linked list
are not constrained to be stored in adjacent location. The
individual elements are stored “somewhere” in memory,
rather like a family dispersed, but still bound together. The
order of the elements is maintained by explicit links between
them. Thus, a linked list is a collection of elements called
nodes, each of which stores two item of information—an
element of the list, and a link, i.e., a pointer or an address that
indicates explicitly the location of the node containing the
successor of this list element.

Write a program to build a linked list by adding new nodes at
the beginning, at the end or in the middle of the linked list.
Also write a function display() which display all the nodes
present in the linked list.

A stack is a data structure in which addition of new element
or deletion of existing element always takes place at the same
