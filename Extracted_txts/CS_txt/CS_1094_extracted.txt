end. This end is often known as ‘top’ of stack. This situation
can be compared to a stack of plates in a cafeteria where every
new plate taken off the stack is also from the ‘top’ of the
stack. There are several application where stack can be put to
use. For example, recursion, keeping track of function calls,
evaluation of expressions, etc. Write a program to implement
a stack using a linked list.

Unlike a stack, in a queue the addition of new element takes
place at the end (called ‘rear’ of queue) whereas deletion takes
place at the other end (called ‘front’ of queue). Write a
program to implement a queue using a linked list.
