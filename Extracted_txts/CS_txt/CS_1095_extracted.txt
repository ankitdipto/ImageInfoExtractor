‘Modify the flowchart of Fig, 6-2 toinclude an error message when a symbolic
address is not defined by a label.

‘Show how the MRI and non-MRI tables can be stored in memory.

List the assembly language program (of the equivalentbinary instructions)
generated by a compiler for the following IF statement:

IF(A-B) 20, 20, 30

‘The program branches to statement 10 if A - B <0; to statement 20 if
A~ B= 0; and to statement 30 if A - B > 0.

a. Explain in words what the following program accomplishes when it is
executed. What is the value of location CTR when the computer halts?

assembler.

‘Write a program loop, using a pointer and a counter, that clears fo 0 the
contents of hexadecimal locations 500 through SFF.

Write a program to multiply two positive numbers by a repeated addition
method. For example, to multiply 5 x 4, the program evaluates the product
by adding 5 four times, or 5 +5 +5 +5

‘The multiplication program of Table 6-14 is not initialized. After the pro-
gram is executed once, location CTR will be left with zero. Show that if
the program is executed again starting from location 100, the loop will
be traversed 65536 times. Add the needed instructions to initialize the
Program.
