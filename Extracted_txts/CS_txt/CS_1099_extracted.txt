details that are OS dependent. Same is true about all other standard
library functions available for /O.

There are numerous library functions available for I/O. These can
be classified into three broad categories:

(a) Console I/O functions - Functions to receive imput
from keyboard and write
output to VDU.

(b) File VO functions - Functions to perform I/O
operations on a floppy disk or
hard disk.

In this chapter we would be discussing only Console I/O functions.
File I/O functions would be discussed in Chapter 12.

Console I/O Functions

The screen and keyboard together are called a console. Console
V/O functions can be further classified into two categoriesâ€”
formatted and unformatted console I/O functions. The basic
difference between them is that the formatted functions allow the
input read from the keyboard or the output displayed on the VDU
to be formatted as per our requirements. For example, if values of
average marks and percentage marks are to be displayed on the
screen, then the details like where this output would appear on the
screen, how many spaces would be present between the two
values, the number of places after the decimal points, etc. can be
controlled using formatted functions. The functions available
under each of these two categories are shown in Figure 11.1. Now
let us discuss these console I/O functions in detail.
