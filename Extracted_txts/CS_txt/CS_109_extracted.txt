which contradicts our assumption that 6f/(s,v) < 5¢(s,v). We conclude that our
assumption that such a vertex v exists is incorrect. .

The next theorem bounds the number of iterations of the Edmonds-Karp algo-
rithm.

Theorem 26.8

If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a flow network G = (V, E) with source 5
and sink f, then the total number of flow augmentations performed by the algorithm
is O(VE).

Proof We say that an edge (u, v) in a residual network G, is critical on an aug-
menting path p if the residual capacity of p is the residual capacity of (u,v), that
is, if c¢(p) = cy(u, v). After we have augmented flow along an augmenting path,
any critical edge on the path disappears from the residual network. Moreover, at
least one edge on any augmenting path must be critical. We will show that each of
the | E| edges can become critical at most |V| /2 times.

Let u and v be vertices in V that are connected by an edge in E. Since augment-
ing paths are shortest paths, when (uw, v) is critical for the first time, we have

5¢(s,v) = d¢(s,u) +1.
Once the flow is augmented, the edge (u, v) disappears from the residual network.
It cannot reappear later on another augmenting path until after the flow from u to v
is decreased, which occurs only if (v, uv) appears on an augmenting path. If f’ is
the flow in G when this event occurs, then we have
5p(s.u) = dp(s,v) +1.
Since 6f(s,v) < 5¢/(s, v) by Lemma 26.7, we have
Sp (s,u) = S(s,v) +1

= Sp(s.v) +1
= Sr(s,u) +2.

Vv

Consequently, from the time (u,v) becomes critical to the time when it next
becomes critical, the distance of wu from the source increases by at least 2. The
distance of u from the source is initially at least 0. The intermediate vertices on a
shortest path from s to u cannot contain s, uv, or f (since (u,v) on an augmenting
path implies that u 4 ¢). Therefore, until uv becomes unreachable from the source,
if ever, its distance is at most |V| — 2. Thus, after the first time that (uv, v) becomes
critical, it can become critical at most (|V| —2)/2 = |V|/2 — 1 times more, for a
total of at most |V| /2 times. Since there are O(E) pairs of vertices that can have an
edge between them in a residual network, the total number of critical edges during
