SECTION 47 Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit 121

Design a 4bit combinational circuit decrementer using four full-adder cir-
cuits.

Assume that the 4-bit arithmetic circuit of Fig, 4-9 is enclosed in one IC
package. Show the connections among two such ICs to form an 8-bitarith-
metic circuit.

Design an arithmetic circuit with one selection variable $ and two n-bit data
inputs A and B. The circuit generates the following four arithmetic opera-
tions in conjunction with the input carry C.. Draw the logic diagram for the
first two stages,

 

s Cn = 0 Cin

+ B (add) ‘D =A * 1 (increment)
1 D=A~1 (decrement) D=A +B +1 (subtract)

 

 

Derive a combinational circuit that selects and generates any of the 16 logic
functions listed in Table 4-5.

Design a digital circuit that performs the four logic operations of exclusive-
OR, exdusive-NOR, NOR, and NAND. Use two selection variables. Show
the logic diagram of one typical stage.

Register A holds the 8-bit binary 11011001. Determine the B operand and the
logic microoperation to be performed in order to change the value in A to:
a. 01101101

b. 1111101

‘The 8-bit registers AR, BR, CR, and DR initially have the following values:

 

AR = 11110010
BR = 111111
CR = 10111001
DR = 11101010

Determine the 8-bit values in each register after theexecution of the follow-
ing sequence of microoperations.

AR<AR + BR Add BR to AR
CR-CR ADR, BR-BR +1 AND DR toCR, increment BR
AR<AR ~ CR Subtract CR from AR

‘An &-bit register contains the binary value 10011100. What is the register
value after an arithmetic shift right? Starting from the initial number
10011100, determine the register value after an arithmetic shif left, and state
whether there is an overflow.

Starting from an initial value of R = 11011101, determine the sequence of
binaryvalues in R after a logical shift-left, followed by a circular shift-right,
followed by a logical shift-right and a circular shifteft.
