Figure 11.1

Formatted Console I/O Functions

As can be seen from Figure 11.1 the functions printf( ), and
scanf( ) fall under the category of formatted console I/O functions.
These functions allow us to supply the input in a fixed format and
let us obtain the output in the specified form. Let us discuss these
functions one by one.

We have talked a lot about printf(), used it regularly, but without
having introduced it formally. Well, better late than never. Its
general form looks like this...

printf (“format string’, list of variables ) ;

The format string can contain:

(a) Characters that are simply printed as they are
(b) Conversion specifications that begin with a % sign
