Chapter 11: Console Input/Output 397

 

(c) Escape sequences that begin with a \ sign

For example, look at the following program:

main()
{

int avg = 346 ;

float per = 69.2 ;

printf ( "Average = %d\nPercentage = %f", avg, per ) ;
}

The output of the program would be...

Average = 346
Percentage = 69.200000

How does printf() function interpret the contents of the format
string. For this it examines the format string from left to right. So
long as it doesnâ€™t come across either a % or a \ it continues to
dump the characters that it encounters, on to the screen. In this
example Average = is dumped on the screen. The moment it
comes across a conversion specification in the format string it
picks up the first variable in the list of variables and prints its value
in the specified format. In this example, the moment %d is met the
variable avg is picked up and its value is printed. Similarly, when
an escape sequence is met it takes the appropriate action. In this
example, the moment \n is met it places the cursor at the beginning
of the next line. This process continues till the end of format string
is not reached.

Format Specifications

The %d and %f used in the printf() are called format specifiers.
They tell printf() to print the value of avg as a decimal integer
and the value of per as a float. Following is the list of format
specifiers that can be used with the printf() function.
