Chapter 11: Console Input/Output 399

 

Now a short explanation about these optional format specifiers.
The field-width specifier tells printf() how many columns on
screen should be used while printing a value. For example, %10d
says, “print the variable as a decimal integer in a field of 10
columns”. If the value to be printed happens not to fill up the
entire field, the value is right justified and is padded with blanks
on the left. If we include the minus sign in format specifier (as in
%-10d), this means left justification is desired and the value will
be padded with blanks on the right. Here is an example that should
make this point clear.

main()
{
int weight = 63 ;

printf ( "\nweight is %d kg", weight ) ;

printf ( "\nweight is %2d kg", weight ) ;
printf ( "\nweight is %4d kg", weight ) ;
printf ( "\nweight is %6d kg", weight ) ;
printf ( "\nweight is %-6d kg", weight) ;

}

The output of the program would look like this ...

Columns —_0123456789012345678901234567890
weight is 63 kg
weight is 63 kg
weight is 63 kg
weight is 63 kg
weight is 63 kg

Specifying the field width can be useful in creating tables of
numeric values, as the following program demonstrates.

main()
{
printf ( "\n%f %f %f", 5.0, 13.5, 133.9) ;
