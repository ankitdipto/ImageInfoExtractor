The format specifier %20s reserves 20 columns for printing a
string and then prints the string in these 20 columns with right
justification. This helps lining up names of different lengths
properly. Obviously, the format %-20s would have left justified
the string.

Escape Sequences

We saw earlier how the newline character, \n, when inserted in a
printf( )’s format string, takes the cursor to the beginning of the
next line. The newline character is an ‘escape sequence’, so called
because the backslash symbol (\) is considered as an ‘escape’
character—it causes an escape from the normal interpretation of a
string, so that the next character is recognized as one having a
special meaning.

The following example shows usage of \n and a new escape
sequence \t, called ‘tab’. A \t moves the cursor to the next tab stop.
A 80-column screen usually has 10 tab stops. In other words, the
screen is divided into 10 zones of 8 columns each. Printing a tab
takes the cursor to the beginning of next printing zone. For
example, if cursor is positioned in column 5, then printing a tab
takes it to column 8.
