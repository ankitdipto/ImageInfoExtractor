Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

the entire execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O(VE). Each augmenting
path has at least one critical edge, and hence the theorem follows. .

Because we can implement each iteration of FORD-FULKERSON in O(Â£) time
when we find the augmenting path by breadth-first search, the total running time of
the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O(VE7). We shall see that push-relabel algorithms
can yield even better bounds. The algorithm of Section 26.4 gives a method for
achieving an O(VE) running time, which forms the basis for the O(V4)-time
algorithm of Section 26.5.

Exercises

26.2-1
Prove that the summations in equation (26.6) equal the summations in equa-
tion (26.7).

26.2-2
In Figure 26.1(b), what is the flow across the cut ({s, v2, v4}. {V1, V3, 0})? What is
the capacity of this cut?

26.2-3
Show the execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm on the flow network of Fig-
ure 26.1(a).

26.2-4

In the example of Figure 26.6, what is the minimum cut corresponding to the max-
imum flow shown? Of the augmenting paths appearing in the example, which one
cancels flow?

26.2-5

Recall that the construction in Section 26.1 that converts a flow network with mul-
tiple sources and sinks into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with
infinite capacity. Prove that any flow in the resulting network has a finite value
if the edges of the original network with multiple sources and sinks have finite
capacity.

26.2-6

Suppose that each source s; in a flow network with multiple sources and sinks
produces exactly p; units of flow, so that cy f(sj.v) = pi. Suppose also
that each sink t; consumes exactly q; units, so that cy f(v.t)) = qj, where
Yi Pi = 2; 47. Show how to convert the problem of finding a flow f that obeys
