I would leave it to you to analyze the results by yourselves. Some
of the conversions you would find are quite sensible.

Let us now turn our attention to scanf( ). scanf( ) allows us to
enter data from keyboard that will be formatted in a certain way.

The general form of scanf() statement is as follows:
scanf (“format string’, list of addresses of variables ) ;

For example:

scanf ("%d %f %c", &c, &a, &ch) ;

Note that we are sending addresses of variables (addresses are
obtained by using ‘&’ the ‘address of operator) to scanf( )
function. This is necessary because the values received from
keyboard must be dropped into variables corresponding to these
addresses. The values that are supplied through the keyboard must
be separated by either blank(s), tab(s), or newline(s). Do not
include these escape sequences in the format string.

All the format specifications that we learnt in printf() function are
applicable to scanf( ) function as well.

sprintf() and sscanf() Functions

The sprintf( ) function works similar to the printf( ) function
except for one small difference. Instead of sending the output to
the screen as printf( ) does, this function writes the output to an
array of characters. The following program illustrates this.

main()
{
