406 Let Us C

 

digest what you have typed. However, we often want a function
that will read a single character the instant it is typed without
waiting for the Enter key to be hit. getch( ) and getche() are two
functions which serve this purpose. These functions return the
character that has been most recently typed. The ‘e’ in getche( )
function means it echoes (displays) the character that you typed to
the screen. As against this getch( ) just returns the character that
you typed without echoing it on the screen. getchar( ) works
similarly and echo’s the character that you typed on the screen, but
unfortunately requires Enter key to be typed following the
character that you typed. The difference between getchar( ) and
fgetchar( ) is that the former is a macro whereas the latter is a
function. Here is a sample program that illustrates the use of these
functions.

main()
{
char ch;

printf ( "\nPress any key to continue" ) ;
getch() ; /* will not echo the character */

printf ( "\nType any character” ) ;
ch = getche() ; /* will echo the character typed */

printf ( "\nType any character” ) ;

getchar() ; /* will echo character, must be followed by enter key */

printf ("\nContinue Y/N") ;

fgetchar() ; /* will echo character, must be followed by enter key */
}

And here is a sample run of this program...

Press any key to continue
Type any character B
Type any character W
Continue Y/N Y
