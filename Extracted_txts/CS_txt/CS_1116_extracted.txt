Chapter 11: Console Input/Output 407

 

putch() and putchar() form the other side of the coin. They print
a character on the screen. As far as the working of putch( )
putchar( ) and fputchar( ) is concerned it’s exactly same. The
following program illustrates this.

main()

{
char ch =A’;

putch (ch) ;

putchar (ch) ;

fputchar (ch) ;

putch (‘Z') ;

putchar (‘Z') ;

fputchar ('Z') ;
}

And here is the output...

AAAZZZ

The limitation of putch( ), putchar( ) and fputchar( ) is that they
can output only one character at a time.

gets() and puts()

gets( ) receives a string from the keyboard. Why is it needed?
Because scanf( ) function has some limitations while receiving
string of characters, as the following example illustrates...

main()
{
char name[50] ;

printf ( “\nEnter name ") ;
scanf ("%s", name ) ;
printf ("%s", name ) ;
