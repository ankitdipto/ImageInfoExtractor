Chapter 11: Console Input/Output 409

 

Jonty Rhodes
Happy footballing!
Jonty Rhodes

Why did we use two puts( ) functions to print “Happy
footballing!” and “Jonty Rhodes”? Because, unlike printf( ),
puts() can output only one string at a time. If we attempt to print
two strings using puts( ), only the first one gets printed. Similarly,
unlike scanf( ), gets( ) can be used to read only one string at a
time.

Summary

(a) There is no keyword available in C for doing input/output.

(b) AIL V/O in C is done using standard library functions.

(c) There are several functions available for performing console
input/output.

(d) The formatted console I/O functions can force the user to
receive the input in a fixed format and display the output in a
fixed format.

(e) There are several format specifiers and escape sequences
available to format input and output.

(f) Unformatted console I/O functions work faster since they do
not have the overheads of formatting the input or output.

Exercise

[A] What would be the output of the following programs:
(a) main()
{

char ch ;
ch = getchar() ;
if (islower (ch) )
putchar ( toupper (ch) ) ;
else
putchar ( tolower (ch) ) ;
