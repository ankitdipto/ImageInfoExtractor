418 Let Us C

 

On execution of this program it displays the contents of the file
‘PR1.C’ on the screen. Let us now understand how it does the
same.

Opening a File

Before we can read (or write) information from (to) a file on a disk

we must open the file. To open the file we have called the function

fopen( ). It would open a file “PR1.C” in ‘read’ mode, which tells

the C compiler that we would be reading the contents of the file.

Note that “r’ is a string and not a character; hence the double

quotes and not single quotes. In fact fopen( ) performs three

important tasks when you open the file in “r” mode:

(a) Firstly it searches on the disk the file to be opened.

(b) Then it loads the file from the disk into a place in memory
called buffer.

(c) It sets up a character pointer that points to the first character
of the buffer.

Why do we need a buffer at all? Imagine how inefficient it would
be to actually access the disk every time we want to read a
character from it. Every time we read something from a disk, it
takes some time for the disk drive to position the read/write head
correctly. On a floppy disk system, the drive motor has to actually
start rotating the disk from a standstill position every time the disk
is accessed. If this were to be done for every character we read
from the disk, it would take a long time to complete the reading
operation. This is where a buffer comes in. It would be more
sensible to read the contents of the file into the buffer while
opening the file and then read the file character by character from
the buffer rather than from the disk. This is shown in Figure 12.2.
