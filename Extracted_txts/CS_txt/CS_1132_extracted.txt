Chapter 12: File Input/Output 421

 

In our program we go on reading each character from the file till
end of file is not met. As each character is read we display it on the
screen. Once out of the loop, we close the file.

Trouble in Opening a File

There is a possibility that when we try to open a file using the
function fopen( ), the file may not be opened. While opening the
file in “r” mode, this may happen because the file being opened
may not be present on the disk at all. And you obviously cannot
read a file that doesn’t exist. Similarly, while opening the file for
writing, fopen( ) may fail due to a number of reasons, like, disk
space may be insufficient to open a new file, or the disk may be
write protected or the disk is damaged and so on.

Crux of the matter is that it is important for any program that
accesses disk files to check whether a file has been opened
successfully before trying to read or write to the file. If the file
opening fails due to any of the several reasons mentioned above,
the fopen( ) function returns a value NULL (defined in “stdio.h”
as #define NULL 0). Here is how this can be handled in a
program...

#include "stdio.h"

main()
{
FILE “fp;
fp = fopen ("PR1.C", "t") ;
if (fp == NULL)
{

puts (“cannot open file”) ;
exit() ;
