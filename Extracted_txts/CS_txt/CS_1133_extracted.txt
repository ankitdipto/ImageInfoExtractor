7-1__Control Memory

‘The function of the control unit in a digital computer is to initiate sequences
of microoperations, The number of different types of microoperations that are
available in a given system is finite. The complexity of the digital system is
derived from the number of sequences of microaperations that are peifoumed.
When the control signals are generated by hardware using conventional logic
design techniques, the control unit is said to be hardwired. Microprogramming,
iga secondalternative for designing the control unit of a digital computer. The
Principle of microprogramming is an elegant and systematic method for con-
trolling the microoperation sequences ina digital computer.

‘The control function that specifies a microoperation is a binary variable.
Whenit is inone binary state, the corresponding microoperation is executed.
A control variable in the opposite binary state does not change the state of the
registers in the system. The active state of a control variable may beeither the
1 state or the 0 state. depending on the application. In a bus-organized system,
the control signals that specify microoperations are groups of bits that select
the paths in multiplexers, decoders, and arithmetic logic units.

The control unit initiates a series of sequential steps of mucrooperations.
During any given time, certain microoperationsare tobe initiated, while others
remain idie. The control variables at any given time can be represented by a
string of I’s and 0's called a control word. As such, control words can be
programmed to perfarm various operations on the components of the systeu.
A control unit whose binary control variables are stored in memory is called
