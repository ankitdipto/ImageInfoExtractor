424 Let Us C

 

Here is a sample run...

Number of characters = 125
Number of blanks = 25
Number of tabs = 13
Number of lines = 22

The above statistics are true for a file “PR1.C”, which I had on my
disk. You may give any other filename and obtain different results.
I believe the program is self-explanatory.

In this program too we have opened the file for reading and then
read it character by character. Let us now try a program that needs
to open a file for writing.

A File-copy Program

We have already used the function fgete( ) which reads characters
from a file. Its counterpart is a function called fpute( ) which
writes characters to a file. As a practical use of these character I/O
functions we can copy the contents of one file into another, as
demonstrated in the following program. This program takes the
contents of a file and copies them into another file, character by
character.

#include "stdio.h"

main()

{
FILE “fs, “ft;
char ch;

fs = fopen("pri.c’,"t") ;

if (fs == NULL)

{
puts ( "Cannot open source file” ) ;
exit() ;
