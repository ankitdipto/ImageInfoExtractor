Chapter 12: File Input/Output 425

 

}
ft = fopen ("pr2.c’, "w") ;
if (ft== NULL)
{
puts (“Cannot open target file" ) ;
fclose (fs ) ;
exit() ;
}
while (1)
{
ch = fgetc (fs ) ;
if (ch == EOF)
break ;
else
fputc (ch, ft) ;
}
fclose (fs) ;
fclose (ft) ;

I hope most of the stuff in the program can be easily understood,
since it has already been dealt with in the earlier section. What is
new is only the function fpute( ). Let us see how it works.

Writing to a File

The fputc( ) function is similar to the putch( ) function, in the
sense that both output characters. However, putch( ) function
always writes to the VDU, whereas, fputc( ) writes to the file.
Which file? The file signified by ft. The writing process continues
till all characters from the source file have been written to the
target file, following which the while loop terminates.
