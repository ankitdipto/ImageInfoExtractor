Let Us C

 

Note that our sample file-copy program is capable of copying only
text files. To copy files with extension .EXE or .COM, we need to
open the files in binary mode, a topic that would be dealt with in
sufficient detail in a later section.

File Opening Modes

In our first program on disk I/O we have opened the file in read

(“r”) mode. However, “1

is but one of the several modes in which

we can open a file. Following is a list of all possible modes in
which a file can be opened. The tasks performed by fopen( ) when
a file is opened in each of these modes are also mentioned.

tr’

"yy"

Searches file. If the file is opened successfully fopen( )
loads it into memory and sets up a pointer which points to
the first character in it. If the file cannot be opened fopen()
returns NULL.

Operations possible — reading from the file.

Searches file. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten.
If the file doesn’t exist, a new file is created. Returns
NULL, if unable to open file.

Operations possible — writing to the file.

Searches file. If the file is opened successfully fopen( )
loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the
last character in it. If the file doesn’t exist, a new file is
created. Returns NULL, if unable to open file.

Operations possible - adding new contents at the end of file.
Searches file. If is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into

memory and sets up a pointer which points to the first
character in it. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.
