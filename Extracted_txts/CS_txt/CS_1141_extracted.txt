428 Let Us C

 

fp = fopen ( "POEM.TXT”, "w");
if (fp == NULL)
{

puts ("Cannot open file” ) ;
exit() ;
}

printf (“\nEnter a few lines of text:\n" ) ;
while (strlen (gets (s)) > 0)
{

fputs ( s, fp) ;
fputs (“\n", fp) ;
}

fclose ( fp);
}

And here is a sample run of the program...

Enter a few lines of text:

Shining and bright, they are forever,
So true about diamonds,

more so of memories,

especially yours !

Note that each string is terminated by hitting enter. To terminate
the execution of the program, hit enter at the beginning of a line.
This creates a string of zero length, which the program recognizes
as the signal to close the file and exit.

We have set up a character array to receive the string; the fputs()
function then writes the contents of the array to the disk. Since
fputs() does not automatically add a newline character to the end
of the string, we must do this explicitly to make it easier to read
the string back from the file.

Here is a program that reads strings from a disk file.
