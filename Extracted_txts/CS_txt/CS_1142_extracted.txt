Chapter 12: File Input/Output 429

 

I" Reads strings from the file and displays them on screen */
#include "stdio.h"

main()

{
FILE “fp;
char s[80] ;

fp = fopen ("POEM.TXT’, "t") ;
if (fp == NULL)
{

puts ("Cannot open file" ) ;
exit() ;
}

while ( fgets (s, 79, fp) != NULL )
printf ("%s", s) ;

fclose (fp) ;
}

And here is the output...

Shining and bright, they are forever,
so true about diamonds,

more so of memories,

especially yours !

The function fgets() takes three arguments. The first is the address
where the string is stored, and the second is the maximum length
of the string. This argument prevents fgets( ) from reading in too
long a string and overflowing the array. The third argument, as
usual, is the pointer to the structure FILE. When all the lines from
the file have been read, we attempt to read one more line, in which
case fgets() returns a NULL.
