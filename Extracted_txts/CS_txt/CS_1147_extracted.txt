step forward in the given direction.

Va,y LocationToward([x, y], OF [x + 1,y]

Ya,y LocationToward({x, y], 90% [xy + 1]

Vx, y LocationToward([xy], 180)= [x - 1,y]

Vx,y LocationToward([x, y], 270 [xy — 1]
From the map, it is possible to tell which square is directly ahead of the agent, or indeed
of any agent p at any location /:

Vp.ls At(p,1,s) >

LocationAhead(p,S) =LocationToward(1, Orientation(p, s))

It is also useful to define adjacency:

Vij,lz Adjacent(I\,hb) < 3d 1, =LocationToward(h,d)
Whatever is known about the contents of the locations (geographical details on the map).
In what follows we assume that the locations surrounding the 4 x 4 cave contain walls, and

other locations do not. Sometimes the agent knows this kind of information to start, ‘and
sometimes it does not.

Vay Wall([x. yl) (x=O0Vx=5 Vy=0Vy=5)
* What the actions do to location. Only going forward changes location, and then only if
there is no wall ahead. The successor-state axiom for location is
Va,d,p,s At(p, 1, Result(a,s))
[ (a =Forward A | =LocationAhead(p,s) \ =Wall()))
V (Atpd,s) A a#Forward)|
+ What the actions do to orientation. Turning is the only action that changes orientation. The
successor-state axiom for orientation is
Va,d,p,s Orientation(p, Result(a, s))=d &
[ (a= Turn(Right)A d= Mod(Orientation(p,s) - 90, 360))
V (a = Turn(Lefi d = Mod(Orientation(p,s) + 90,360))
V (Orientation(p,s) = d A 7(a= Turn(Right( a = Turn(Left))}
In addition to keeping track of location and the gold, the agent should also keep track of whether
the wumpus is alive or dead. We leave the problem of describing Shoot as an exercise.

Once the agent knows where it is, it can associate qualities with the places rather than just the
situations, so, for example, one might say that if the agent is at a place and perceives a breeze,
then that place is breezy, and if the agent perceives a stench, then that place is smelly:

Vi/,s At(Agent,J, s) A Breeze(s) = Breezy(D)

V/,8 At(Agent, /,s) A Stench(s) => Smelly()
