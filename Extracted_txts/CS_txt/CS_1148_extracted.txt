Chapter 12: File Input/Output 433

 

Let us now write a program that reads the employee records
created by the above program. Here is how it can be done...

I" Read records from a file using structure */
#include "stdio.h"

main()

{
FILE “fp;
struct emp

char name[40] ;
int age ;
float bs ;

hi

struct emp e;

fp = fopen ("EMPLOYEE.DAT", "") ;
if (fp == NULL)
{
puts ("Cannot open file” ) ;
exit() ;
}

while (fscanf ( fp, "%s %d %f", e.name, &e.age, &e.bs ) != EOF )
printf ( "\n%s %d %f", e.name, e.age, e.bs ) ;

fclose (fp) ;
}

And here is the output of the program...

Sunil 34 1250.500000
Sameer 21 1300.500000
Rahul 34 1400.500000
