Text Files and Binary Files

All the programs that we wrote in this chapter so far worked on
text files. Some of them would not work correctly on binary files.
A text file contains only textual information like alphabets, digits
and special symbols. In actuality the ASCII codes of these
characters are stored in text files. A good example of a text file is
any C program, say PR1.C.

As against this, a binary file is merely a collection of bytes. This
collection might be a compiled version of a C program (say
PR1.EXE), or music data stored in a wave file or a picture stored
in a graphic file. A very easy way to find out whether a file is a
text file or a binary file is to open that file in Turbo C/C++. If on
opening the file you can make out what is displayed then it is a
text file, otherwise it is a binary file.

As mentioned while explaining the file-copy program, the program
cannot copy binary files successfully. We can improve the same
program to make it capable of copying text as well as binary files
as shown below.

#include "stdio.h"
main()

FILE “fs, “ft;
int ch ;

fs = fopen ("prt.exe", "tb") ;

if (fs == NULL)

{
puts ( "Cannot open source file” ) ;
exit() ;

}

ft = fopen (“newpr1.exe", "wb" ) ;
