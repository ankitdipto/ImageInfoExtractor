if (ft== NULL)

{
puts (“Cannot open target file" ) ;
fclose (fs ) ;
exit() ;

}

while (1)
ch = fgetc (fs ) ;

if (ch == EOF)
break ;
else
fpute ( ch, ft) ;
}

fclose (fs) ;
fclose (ft) ;
}

Using this program we can comfortably copy text as well as binary
files. Note that here we have opened the source and target files in
“rb” and “wb” modes respectively. While opening the file in text

mode we can use either “r” or “rt”, but since text mode is the
default mode we usually drop the ‘t’.

From the programming angle there are three main areas where text
and binary mode files are different. These are:

(a) Handling of newlines
(b) Representation of end of file

(c) Storage of numbers

Let us explore these three differences.
