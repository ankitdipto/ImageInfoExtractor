438 Let Us C

 

using fprintf( ), or reading them using fscanf( ), becomes
quite clumsy.

Let us now see a more efficient way of reading/writing records
(structures). This makes use of two functions fread() and
fwrite(). We will write two programs, first one would write
records to the file and the second would read these records from
the file and display them on the screen.

/" Receives records from keyboard and writes them to a file in binary mode */
#include "stdio.h"
main()
{
FILE “fp;
char another = 'Y' ;
struct emp

char name[40] ;
int age ;
float bs ;

};

struct emp e;

fp = fopen ("EMP.DAT", "wb" ) ;

if (fp == NULL)

{
puts ("Cannot open file” ) ;
exit() ;

}

while ( another == 'Y')

printf ( "\nEnter name, age and basic salary: " ) ;
scant ("%s %d %f", e.name, &e.age, &e.bs ) ;
fwrite ( &e, sizeof (e ), 1, fp);

printf ( "Add another record (Y/N) ") ;
