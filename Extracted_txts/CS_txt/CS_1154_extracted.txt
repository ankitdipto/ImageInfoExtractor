Chapter 12: File Input/Output 439

 

fflush (stdin ) ;
another = getche() ;
}
fclose (fp) ;

}
And here is the output...

Enter name, age and basic salary: Suresh 24 1250.50
Add another record (Y/N) Y
Enter name, age and basic salary: Ranjan 21 1300.60
Add another record (Y/N) Y
Enter name, age and basic salary: Harish 28 1400.70
Add another record (Y/N) N

Most of this program is similar to the one that we wrote earlier,
which used fprintf( ) instead of fwrite( ). Note, however, that the
file “EMP.DAT” has now been opened in binary mode.

The information obtained from the keyboard about the employee is
placed in the structure variable e. Then, the following statement
writes the structure to the file:

fwrite ( &e, sizeof (e ), 1, fp) ;

Here, the first argument is the address of the structure to be written
to the disk.

The second argument is the size of the structure in bytes. Instead
of counting the bytes occupied by the structure ourselves, we let
the program do it for us by using the sizeof() operator. The
sizeof( ) operator gives the size of the variable in bytes. This keeps
the program unchanged in event of change in the elements of the
structure.
