440 Let Us C

 

The third argument is the number of such structures that we want
to write at one time. In this case, we want to write only one
structure at a time. Had we had an array of structures, for example,
we might have wanted to write the entire array at once.

The last argument is the pointer to the file we want to write to.

Now, let us write a program to read back the records written to the
disk by the previous program.

/" Reads records from binary file and displays them on VDU */
#include "stdio.h"
main()

FILE “fp;
struct emp

char name[40] ;
int age ;
float bs ;

};

struct emp e ;

fp = fopen ("EMP.DAT", "rb" ) ;
if (fp == NULL)
{
puts ( "Cannot open file” ) ;
exit() ;
}

while (fread ( &e, sizeof (e ), 1, fp) == 1)
printf ( "\n%s %d %f", e.name, e.age, e.bs ) ;

fclose ( fp) ;
