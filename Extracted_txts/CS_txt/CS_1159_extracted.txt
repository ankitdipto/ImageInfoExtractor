number to be modified, it would be more meaningful to ask for
the name of the employee whose record is to be modified. On
modifying the record, the existing record gets overwritten by
the new record.

In deleting records, except for the record to be deleted, rest of
the records must first be written to a temporary file, then the
original file must be deleted, and the temporary file must be
renamed back to original.

Observe carefully the way the file has been opened, first for
reading & writing, and if this fails (the first time you run this
program it would certainly fail, because that time the file is not
existing), for writing and reading. It is imperative that the file
should be opened in binary mode.

Note that the file is being opened only once and closed only
once, which is quite logical.

clrscr( ) function clears the contents of the screen and
gotoxy() places the cursor at appropriate position on the
screen. The parameters passed to gotoxy() are column number
followed by row number.
