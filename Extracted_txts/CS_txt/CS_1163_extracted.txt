To understand how this program works, you need to be familiar
with the concept of pointers. A pointer is initiated whenever we
open a file. On opening a file a pointer is set up which points to the
first record in the file. To be precise this pointer is present in the
structure to which the file pointer retumed by fopen( ) points to.
On using the functions fread( ) or fwrite( ), the pointer moves to
the beginning of the next record. On closing a file the pointer is
deactivated. Note that the pointer movement is of utmost
importance since fread( ) always reads that record where the
pointer is currently placed. Similarly, fwrite( ) always writes the
record where the pointer is currently placed.

The rewind( ) function places the pointer to the beginning of the
file, irrespective of where it is present right now.

The fseek( ) function lets us move the pointer from one record to
another. In the program above, to move the pointer to the previous
record from its current position, we used the function,
