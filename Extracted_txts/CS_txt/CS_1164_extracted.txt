Chapter 12: File Input/Output 447

 

fseek ( fp, -recsize, SEEK_CUR) ;

Here, -recsize moves the pointer back by recsize bytes from the
current position. SEEK_CUR is a macro defined in “stdio.h’”.

Similarly, the following fseek( ) would place the pointer beyond
the last record in the file.

fseek (fp, 0, SEEK_END ) ;

In fact -recsize or 0 are just the offsets that tell the compiler by
how many bytes should the pointer be moved from a particular
position. The third argument could be SEEK_END, SEEK_CUR
or SEEK_SET. All these act as a reference from which the pointer
should be offset. SEEK_END means move the pointer from the
end of the file) SEEK_CUR means move the pointer with
reference to its current position and SEEK_SET means move the
pointer with reference to the beginning of the file.

If we wish to know where the pointer is positioned right now, we
can use the function ftell( ). It returns this position as a long int
which is an offset from the beginning of the file. The value
returned by ftell( ) can be used in subsequent calls to fseek(). A
sample call to ftell( ) is shown below:

position = ftell ( fp ) ;

where position is a long int.

Low Level Disk I/O

In low level disk I/O, data cannot be written as individual
characters, or as strings or as formatted data. There is only one
way data can be written or read in low level disk I/O functions—as
a buffer full of bytes.
