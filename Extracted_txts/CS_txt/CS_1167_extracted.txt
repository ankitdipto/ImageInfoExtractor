Declaring the Buffer

The first difference that you will notice in this program is that we
declare a character buffer,

char buffer[512] ;

This is the buffer in which the data read from the disk will be
placed. The size of this buffer is important for efficient operation.
Depending on the operating system, buffers of certain sizes are
handled more efficiently than others.

Opening a File

We have opened two files in our program, one is the source file
from which we read the information, and the other is the target file
into which we write the information read from the source file.

As in high level disk I/O, the file must be opened before we can
access it. This is done using the statement,

inhandle = open ( source, O_RDONLY | O_BINARY) ;

We open the file for the same reason as we did earlierâ€”to
establish communication with operating system about the file. As
usual, we have to supply to open( ), the filename and the mode in
which we want to open the file. The possible file opening modes
are given below:

O_APPEND _ - Opens a file for appending
