Chapter 12: File Input/Output 451

 

O_CREAT - Creates a new file for writing (has no effect
if file already exists)

O_RDONLY  - Creates a new file for reading only

O_RDWR - Creates a file for both reading and writing

O_WRONLY - Creates a file for writing only

O_BINARY _ - Creates a file in binary mode

O_TEXT - Creates a file in text mode

These ‘O-flags’ are defined in the file “fentl.h”. So this file must
be included in the program while usng low level disk I/O. Note
that the file “stdio.h” is not necessary for low level disk I/O. When
two or more O-flags are used together, they are combined using
the bitwise OR operator (|). Chapter 14 discusses bitwise
operators in detail.

The other statement used in our program to open the file is,

outhandle = open ( target, O_CREAT | O_BINARY | O_WRONLY,
S_IWRITE);

Note that since the target file is not existing when it is being
opened we have used the O_CREAT flag, and since we want to
write to the file and not read from it, therefore we have used
O_WRONLY. And finally, since we want to open the file in
binary mode we have used O_BINARY.

Whenever O_CREAT flag is used, another argument must be
added to open( ) function to indicate the read/write status of the
file to be created. This argument is called ‘permission argument’.
Permission arguments could be any of the following:

S_IWRITE - Writing to the file permitted
S_TREAD - Reading from the file permitted
