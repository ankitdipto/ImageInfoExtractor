Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Intuitively, each edge (u,v) € M corresponds to one unit of flow in G’ that
traverses the path s + u — v — t. Moreover, the paths induced by edges in M
are vertex-disjoint, except for s and ¢. The net flow across cut (L U {5s}, R U {f})
is equal to |M|; thus, by Lemma 26.4, the value of the flow is | /| = |M|.

To prove the converse, let f be an integer-valued flow in G’, and let

M ={(u,v):ueL, ve R, and f(u,v) > 0}.

Each vertex u € L has only one entering edge, namely (s,u), and its capacity
is 1. Thus, each u € L has at most one unit of flow entering it, and if one unit of
flow does enter, by flow conservation, one unit of flow must leave. Furthermore,
since f is integer-valued, for each u € L, the one unit of flow can enter on at most
one edge and can leave on at most one edge. Thus, one unit of flow enters u if and
only if there is exactly one vertex v € R such that f(u,v) = 1, and at most one
edge leaving each u € L carries positive flow. A symmetric argument applies to
each v € R. The set M is therefore a matching.

To see that |M| = |/ |, observe that for every matched vertex u € L, we have
Ff (s,u) = 1, and for every edge (u,v) € E — M, we have f(u,v) = 0. Conse-
quently, f(L U {s}, R U {7}), the net flow across cut (L U {s}, R U {t}), is equal
to |M|. Applying Lemma 26.4, we have that | f| = f(LU{s}, RU{t}) =|M|. @

 

 

Based on Lemma 26.9, we would like to conclude that a maximum matching
in a bipartite graph G corresponds to a maximum flow in its corresponding flow
network G’, and we can therefore compute a maximum matching in G by running
a maximum-flow algorithm on G’. The only hitch in this reasoning is that the
maximum-flow algorithm might return a flow in G’ for which some f (u,v) is
not an integer, even though the flow value | f| must be an integer. The following
theorem shows that if we use the Ford-Fulkerson method, this difficulty cannot
arise.

Theorem 26.10 (Integrality theorem)

If the capacity function c takes on only integral values, then the maximum flow f
produced by the Ford-Fulkerson method has the property that | f| is an integer.
Moreover, for all vertices u and v, the value of f(u, v) is an integer.

Proof The proof is by induction on the number of iterations. We leave it as
Exercise 26.3-2. /

We can now prove the following corollary to Lemma 26.9.
