To use these permissions, both the files “types.h” and “stat.h” must
be #included in the program alongwith “fentl.h’.

File Handles

Instead of returning a FILE pointer as fopen( ) did, in low level
disk I/O, open( ) returns an integer value called ‘file handle’. This
is a number assigned to a particular file, which is used thereafter to
refer to the file. If open( ) returns a value of -1, it means that the
file couldn’t be successfully opened.

Interaction between Buffer and File

The following statement reads the file or as much of it as will fit
into the buffer:

bytes = read (inhandle, buffer, 512 ) ;

The read( ) function takes three arguments. The first argument is
the file handle, the second is the address of the buffer and the third
is the maximum number of bytes we want to read.

The read( ) function returns the number of bytes actually read.
This is an important number, since it may very well be less than
the buffer size (512 bytes), and we will need to know just how full
the buffer is before we can do anything with its contents. In our
program we have assigned this number to the variable bytes.

For copying the file, we must use both the read( ) and the write( )
functions in a while loop. The read( ) function returns the number
of bytes actually read. This is assigned to the variable bytes. This
value will be equal to the buffer size (512 bytes) until the end of
file, when the buffer will only be partially full. The variable bytes
therefore is used to tell write( ), as to how many bytes to write
from the buffer to the target file.
