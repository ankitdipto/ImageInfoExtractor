454 Let Us C

 

(f) Many library functions convert a number to a numeric string

before writing it to a file, thereby using more space on disk.
This can be avoided using functions fread() and fwrite().

(g) In low level file I/O we can do the buffer management

ourselves.

Exercise

[A] Point out the errors, if any, in the following programs:

(a)

#include "stdio.h"
main()
{

FILE “fp ;

openfile ("Myfile.txt’, fp ) ;

if (fp == NULL)

printf ( "Unable to open file..." ) ;

}

openfile ( char “fn, FILE *“f )
{
“f=fopen (fn, "r");

#include "stdio.h"
main()
{
FILE “fp;
char c;
fp = fopen ("TRY.C","t') ;
if ( fp == null )
{
puts ("Cannot open file” ) ;
exit() ;

}

while ((c = getc ( fp )) != EOF )
putch (c) ;

fclose (fp) ;
