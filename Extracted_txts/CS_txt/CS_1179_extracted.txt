(1) An offset cipher: In an offset cipher each character from
the source file is offset with a fixed value and then
written to the target file.

For example, if character read from the source file is ‘A’,
then convert this into a new character by offsetting ‘A’
by a fixed value, say 128, and then writing the new
character to the target file.

(2) A substitution cipher: In this each character read from the
source file is substituted by a corresponding
predetermined character and this character is written to
the target file.

For example, if character ‘A’ is read from the source file,
and if we have decided that every ‘A’ is to be substituted
by ‘!’, then a ‘!’ would be written to the target file in
place of every ‘A’ Similarly, every ‘B’ would be
substituted by ‘5’ and so on.

(i) In the file ‘CUSTOMER.DAT?’ there are 100 records with the
following structure:

struct customer

{
int accno ;
char name[30] ;
float balance ;

hi

In another file ‘TRANSACTIONS.DAT’ there are several
records with the following structure:

struct trans
{
int accno ,
char trans_type ;
