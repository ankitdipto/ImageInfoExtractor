float amount ;

The parameter trans_type contains D/W indicating deposit or
withdrawal of amount. Write a program to update
“‘CUSTOMER.DAT’ file, ie. if the trans_type is ‘D’ then
update the balance of ‘CUSTOMER.DAT’ by adding
amount to balance for the corresponding aceno. Similarly, if
trans_type is ‘W’ then subtract the amount from balance.
However, while subtracting the amount make sure that the
amount should not get overdrawn, i.e. at least 100 Rs. Should
remain in the account.

There are 100 records present in a file with the following
structure:

struct date
{

hs;

intd,m, y;

struct employee

int empcode[6] ;
char empname[20] ;
struct date join_date ;
float salary ;

};

Write a program to read these records, arrange them in
ascending order of join_date and write them in to a target
file.

A hospital keeps a file of blood donors in which each record
has the format:

Name: 20 Columns

Address: 40 Columns
