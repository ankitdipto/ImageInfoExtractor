466 Let Us C

 

done in C. There are still some more issues related with
input/output that remain to be understood. These issues help in
making the I/O operations more elegant.

E: Chapters 11 and 12 we saw how Console I/O and File I/O are

Using argc and argv

To execute the file-copy programs that we saw in Chapter 12 we
are required to first type the program, compile it, and then execute
it. This program can be improved in two ways:

(a) There should be no need to compile the program every time to
use the file-copy utility. It means the program must be
executable at command prompt (A> or C> if you are using
MS-DOS, Start | Run dialog if you are using Windows and $
prompt if you are using Unix).

(b) Instead of the program prompting us to enter the source and
target filenames, we must be able to supply them at command
prompt, in the form:

filecopy PR1.C PR2.C

where, PR1.C is the source filename and PR2.C is the target
filename.

The first improvement is simple. In MS-DOS, the executable file
(the one which can be executed at command prompt and has an
extension .EXE) can be created in Turbo C/C++ by using the key
F9 to compile the program. In VC++ compiler under Windows
same can be done by using F7 to compile the program. Under Unix
this is not required since in Unix every time we compile a program
we always get an executable file.

The second improvement is possible by passing the source
filename and target filename to the function main( ). This is
illustrated below:
