The arguments that we pass on to main() at the command prompt
are called command line arguments. The function main() can
have two arguments, traditionally named as arge and argv. Out of
these, argv is an array of pointers to strings and arge is an int
whose value is equal to the number of strings to which argv
points. When the program is executed, the strings on the command
line are passed to main(). More precisely, the strings at the
command line are stored in memory and address of the first string
is stored in argv[0], address of the second string is stored in
argy[1] and so on. The argument arge is set to the number of
strings given on the command line. For example, in our sample
program, if at the command prompt we give,

filecopy PR1.C PR2.C

then,

argc would contain 3

argv[0] would contain base address of the string â€œfilecopy"
argv[1] would contain base address of the string "PR1.C"
argv[2] would contain base address of the string "PR2.C"

Whenever we pass arguments to main(), it is a good habit to
check whether the correct number of arguments have been passed
on to main() or not. In our program this has been done through,

if ( argc != 3)
{

printf ( "Improper number of arguments" ) ;
exit() ;
