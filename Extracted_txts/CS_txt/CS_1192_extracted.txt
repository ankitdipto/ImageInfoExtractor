value, ! makes it 0 and since now the condition evaluates to false
the while loop gets terminated.

Note that in each one of them the following three methods for
opening a file are same, since in each one of them, essentially a
base address of the string (pointer to a string) is being passed to
fopen().

fs = fopen ("PR1.C", "t") ;
fs = fopen (filename,
fs = fopen (argy[1], "t") ;

   

Detecting Errors in Reading/Writing

Not at all times when we perform a read or write operation on a
file are we successful in doing so. Naturally there must be a
provision to test whether our attempt to read/write was successful
or not.

The standard library function ferror( ) reports any error that might
have occurred during a read/write operation on a file. It returns a
zero if the read/write is successful and a non-zero value in case of
a failure. The following program illustrates the usage of ferror().

#include "stdio.h"

main()

{
FILE â€œfp;
char ch;

fp = fopen ( "TRIAL", "w') ;
while ( !feof ( fp ) )
{

ch = fgetc (fp) ;

if ( ferror() )
