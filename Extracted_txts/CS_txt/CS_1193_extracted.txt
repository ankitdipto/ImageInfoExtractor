printf (“Error in reading file” ) ;

break ;
}
else
printf ("%c", ch) ;
}
fclose (fp) ;

}

In this program the fgete( ) function would obviously fail first time
around since the file has been opened for writing, whereas fgetc( )
is attempting to read from the file. The moment the error occurs
ferror() returns a non-zero value and the if block gets executed.
Instead of printing the error message using printf( ) we can use the
standard library function perror( ) which prints the error message
specified by the compiler. Thus in the above program the perror()
function can be used as shown below.

if (ferror() )

{
perror ("TRIAL") ;
break ;

}

Note that when the error occurs the error message that is displayed
is:

TRIAL: Permission denied
This means we can precede the system error message with any

message of our choice. In our program we have just displayed the
filename in place of the error message.
