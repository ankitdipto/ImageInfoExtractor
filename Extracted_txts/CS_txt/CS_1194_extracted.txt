Figure 1-19 SR flip-flop.

indicator symbol denotes the fact that the flip-flop responds to a positive
transition (from 0 to 1) of the input clock signal

The operation of the SR flip-flop is as follows. If there is no signal at the
clock input C, the output of the circuit cannot change irrespective of the values
at inputs S and R. Only when the clock signal changes from 0 to 1 can the
output be affected according to the values in inputs Sand R. IfS = landR =0
when C changes from 0 to 1, output Qis set to 1. If $ = 0 and R = 1 when C
changes from 0 to 1, output Q is cleared to 0. If both $ and R are 0 during the
clock transition, the output does not change. When both S and R are equal to
1, the output is unpredictable and may go to either 0 or 1, depending on
internal timing delays that occur within the circuit.

The characteristic table shown in Fig. 1-19(b) summarizes the operation
of the SR flip-flop in tabular form. The $ and R columns give the binary values
of the two inputs. Q(t) is the binary state of the Q output at a given time
(referred to as present state). Q(t + 1) is the binary state of the Q output after
the occurrence of a clock transition (referred to as next state). If S = R=0,a
clock transition produces no change of state [i.e., Q(t + 1) = Q(t)]. If S$ =0
and R = 1, the flip-flop goes to the 0 (clear) state. If S = 1 and R = 0, the
flip-flop goes to the 1 (set) state. The SR flip-flop should not be pulsed when
S = R= 1 since it produces an indeterminate next state. This indeterminate
condition makes the SR flip-flop difficult to manage and therefore it is seldom
used in practice.

D Flip-Flop
The D (data) flip-flop is a slight modification of the SR flip-flop. An SR flip-flop
is converted to a D flip-flop by inserting an inverter between S and R and
assigning the symbol D to the single input. The D input is sampled during the
occurrence of a clock transition from 0 to 1. If D = 1, the outputof the flip-flop
goes to the 1 state, but if D = 0, the output of the flip-flop goes to the 0 state.
The graphic symbol and characteristic table of the D flip-flop are shown
in Fig. 1-20. From the characteristic table we note that the next state Q(t + 1)
