This can be implemented with a multiplexer. Suppose that there are eight
status bit conditions in the system. Three bits in the microinstruction are used
to specify any one of eight status bit conditions. These three bits provide the
selection variables for the multiplexer. If the selected status bit isin the 1 state,
the output of the multiplexer is 1; otherwise, it is 0. A 1 output in the multi-
plexer generates a control signal to transfer the branch address from the
microinstruction into the control address register. A 0 output in the multiplexer
causes the address register to be incremented. In this configuration, the
microprogram follows one of two possible paths, depending on the value of
the selected status bit.
