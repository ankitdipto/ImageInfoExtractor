Standard I/O Devices

To perform reading or writing operations on a file we need to use
the function fopen(), which sets up a file pointer to refer to this
file. Most OSs also predefine pointers for three standard files. To
access these pointers we need not use fopen(). These standard file
pointers are shown in Figure 13.1

 

 

Standard File pointer | Description

 

 

 

stdin standard input device (Keyboard)
stdout standard output device (VDU)
stderr standard error device (VDU)

Thus the statement ch = fgetc ( stdin ) would read a character
from the keyboard rather than from a file. We can use this
statement without any need to use fopen() or fclose() function
calls.

Note that under MS-DOS two more standard file pointers are
available—stdprn and stdaux. They stand for standard printing
device and standard auxiliary device (serial port). The following
program shows how to use the standard file pointers. It reads a file
from the disk and prints it on the printer.

/* Prints file contents on printer */
#include "stdio.h"
main()

FILE “fp;
char ch;
