shown in the following sample run. The Ctrl-Z character is often
called end of file character.

C>UTIL.EXE

perhaps | had a wicked childhood,

perhaps | had a miserable youth,

but somewhere in my wicked miserable past,
there must have been a moment of truth “Z
C>

Now let’s see what happens when we invoke this program from in
a different way, using redirection:

C>UTIL.EXE > POEM.TXT
C>

Here we are causing the output to be redirected to the file
POEM.TXT. Can we prove that this the output has indeed gone to
the file POEM.TXT? Yes, by using the TYPE command as
follows:

C>TYPE POEM.TXT

perhaps | had a wicked childhood,

perhaps | had a miserable youth,

but somewhere in my wicked miserable past,
there must have been a moment of truth

C>

There’s the result of our typing sitting in the file. The redirection
operator, ‘>’, causes any output intended for the screen to be
written to the file whose name follows the operator.

Note that the data to be redirected to a file doesn’t need to be typed
by a user at the keyboard; the program itself can generate it. Any
output normally sent to the screen can be redirected to a disk file.
As an example consider the following program for generating the
ASCII table on screen:
