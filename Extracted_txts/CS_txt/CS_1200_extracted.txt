476 Let Us C

 

/* File name: ascii.c*/
main()
{

int ch;

for (ch =0; ch <= 255 ; ch++ )
printf (“\n%d %c", ch, ch) ;
}

When this program is compiled and then executed at command
prompt using the redirection operator,

C>ASCILEXE > TABLE.TXT

the output is written to the file. This can be a useful capability any
time you want to capture the output in a file, rather than displaying
it on the screen.

DOS predefines a number of filenames for its own use. One of
these names in PRN, which stands for the printer. Output can be
redirected to the printer by using this filename. For example, if you
invoke the “ascii.exe” program this way:

C>ASCILEXE > PRN

the ASCII table will be printed on the printer.

Redirecting the Input

We can also redirect input to a program so that, instead of reading
a character from the keyboard, a program reads it from a file. Let
us now see how this can be done.

To redirect the input, we need to have a file containing something
to be displayed. Suppose we use a file called NEWPOEM.TXT
containing the following lines:
