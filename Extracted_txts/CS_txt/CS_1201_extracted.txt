Chapter 13: More Issues In Input/Output 477

 

Let's start at the very beginning,
A very good place to start!

We'll assume that using some text editor these lines have been
placed in the file NEWPOEM.TXT. Now, we use the input
redirection operator ‘<’ before the file, as shown below:

C>UTIL.EXE < NEWPOEM.TXT
Let's start at the very beginning,

C>

The lines are printed on the screen with no further effort on our
part. Using redirection we’ve made our program UTIL.C perform
the work of the TYPE command.

Both Ways at Once

Redirection of input and output can be used together; the input for
a program can come from a file via redirection, at the same time its
output can be redirected to a file. Such a program is called a filter.
The following command demonstrates this process.

C>UTIL < NEWPOEM.TXT > POETRY.TXT

In this case our program receives the redirected input from the file
NEWPOEM. TXT and instead of sending the output to the screen it
would redirect it to the file POETRY.TXT.

Similarly to send the contents of the file NEWPOEM.TXT to the
printer we can use the following command:

C>UTIL < NEWPOEM.TXT > PRN

While using such multiple redirections don’t try to send output to
the same file from which you are receiving input. This is because
