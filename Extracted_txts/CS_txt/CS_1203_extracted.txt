the output file is erased before it’s written to. So by the time we
manage to receive the input from a file it is already erased.

Redirection can be a powerful tool for developing utility programs
to examine or alter data in files. Thus, redirection is used to
establish a relationship between a program and a file. Another OS
operator can be used to relate two programs directly, so that the
output of one is fed directly into another, with no files involved.
This is called ‘piping’, and is done using the operator ‘|’, called
pipe. We won’t pursue this topic, but you can read about it in the
OS help/manual.

We can pass parameters to a program at command line using
the concept of ‘command line arguments’.

The command line argument argv contains values passed to
the program, whereas, arge contains number of arguments.

We can use the standard file pointer stdin to take input from
standard input device such as keyboard.

We can use the standard file poiter stdout to send output to
the standard output device such as a monitor.

We can use the standard file pointers stdprn and stdaux to
interact with printer and auxiliary devices respectively.
Redirection allows a program to read from or write to files at
command prompt.

The operators < and > are called redirection operators.
