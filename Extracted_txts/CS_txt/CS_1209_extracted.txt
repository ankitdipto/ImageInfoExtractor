Chapter 14: Operations On Bits 483

 

us first take a look at the bit numbering scheme in integers an
characters. Bits are numbered from zero onwards, increasing from
right to left as shown below:

16-bit Integer

Throughout this discussion of bitwise operators we are going to
use a function called showbits( ), but we are not going to show
you the details of the function immediately. The task of
showbits( ) is to display the binary representation of any integer or
character value.

We begin with a plain-jane example with showbits( ) in action.
/* Print binary equivalent of integers using showbits( ) function */
main()
{
int j;
for (j=0;j<<=5; j++)

printf ( "\nDecimal %d is same as binary ",j) ;
showbits (j) ;
