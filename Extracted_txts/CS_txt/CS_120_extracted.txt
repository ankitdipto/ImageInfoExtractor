Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

the fixed height |V| of the source. As we shall see, once we have emptied all the
reservoirs, the preflow is not only a “legal” flow, it is also a maximum flow.

The basic operations

From the preceding discussion, we see that a push-relabel algorithm performs two
basic operations: pushing flow excess from a vertex to one of its neighbors and
relabeling a vertex. The situations in which these operations apply depend on the
heights of vertices, which we now define precisely.

Let G = (V,E) be a flow network with source s and sink f, and let f be a
preflow in G. A function h : V — N is a height function’ if h(s) = |V|,
h(t) = 0, and

hu) <h(v) +1

for every residual edge (u,v) € Ey. We immediately obtain the following lemma.

Lemma 26.12

Let G = (V, E) bea flow network, let f be a preflow in G, and let h be a height
function on V. For any two vertices u,v € V, if h(w) > h(v) + 1, then (w, v) is
not an edge in the residual network. .

The push operation

The basic operation PUSH(w, v) applies if v is an overflowing vertex, cf(u, v) > 0,
and h(u) = h(v)+ 1. The pseudocode below updates the preflow f and the excess
flows for u and v. It assumes that we can compute residual capacity cf (u,v) in
constant time given c and f. We maintain the excess flow stored at a vertex u as
the attribute uv. and the height of w as the attribute u.h. The expression A; (u,v)
is a temporary variable that stores the amount of flow that we can push from u to v.

 

3In the literature, a height function is typically called a “distance function,” and the height of a vertex
is called a “distance label.” We use the term “height” because it is more suggestive of the intuition
behind the algorithm. We retain the use of the term “relabel” to refer to the operation that increases
the height of a vertex. The height of a vertex is related to its distance from the sink f, as would be
found in a breadth-first search of the transpose GT.
