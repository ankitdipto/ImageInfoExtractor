Chapter 14: Operations On Bits 485

 

showbits ( k) ;
}

And here is the output of the above program...

Decimal 0 is same as binary 0000000000000000
One's complement of 0 is 1111111111111111
Decimal 1 is same as binary 0000000000000001
One's complement of 1 is 1111111111111110
Decimal 2 is same as binary 0000000000000010
One's complement of 2 is 1111111111111101
Decimal 3 is same as binary 0000000000000011
One's complement of 3 is 1111111111111100

In real-world situations where could the one’s complement
operator be useful? Since it changes the original number beyond
recognition, one potential place where it can be effectively used is
in development of a file encryption utility as shown below:

/" File encryption utility */
#include "stdio.h"
main()
{

encrypt() ;

encrypt()

{
FILE “fs, “ft;
char ch;

fs = fopen ("SOURCE.C’, "r"
ft=fopen ("TARGET.C", "w

 

; / normal file */
); F encrypted file */

 

if (fs == NULL || ft == NULL )
{
