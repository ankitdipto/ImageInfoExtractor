486 Let Us C

 

printf ( "\nFile opening error!" ) ;
exit (1);

while ( (ch = getc (fs )) |= EOF )
putc (~ch, ft) ;

fclose (fs ) ;
fclose (ft);
}

How would you write the corresponding decrypt function? Would
there be any problem in tackling the end of file marker? It may be
recalled here that the end of file in text files is indicated by a
character whose ASCII value is 26.

Right Shift Operator

The right shift operator is represented by >>. It needs two
operands. It shifts each bit in its left operand to the right. The
number of places the bits are shifted depends on the number
following the operator (i.e. its right operand).

Thus, ch >> 3 would shift all bits in ch three places to the right.
Similarly, ch >> 5 would shift all bits 5 places to the right.

For example, if the variable ch contains the bit pattern 11010111,
then, ch >> 1 would give 01101011 and ch >> 2 would give
00110101.

Note that as the bits are shifted to the right, blanks are created on
the left. These blanks must be filled somehow. They are always
filled with zeros. The following program demonstrates the effect
of right shift operator.

main()
{
