490 Let Us C

 

The binary equivalent of 5225 is 0001 0100 0110 1001. This
inary value is placed in the date field in the directory entry of the
file as shown below.

Figure 14.4

Just to verify this bit distribution, let us take the bits representing
the month,

month = 0011
=1°2+1"1
=3

Similarly, the year and the day can also be verified.

When we issue the command DIR or use Windows Explorer to list
the files, the file’s date is again presented on the screen in the
usual date format of mm/dd/yy. How does this integer to date
conversion take place? Obviously, using left shift and right shift
operators.

When we take a look at Figure 14.4 depicting the bit pattern of the
2- byte date field, we see that the year, month and day exist as a
bunch of bits in contiguous locations. Separating each of them is a
matter of applying the bitwise operators.

For example, to get year as a separate entity from the two bytes
entry we right shift the entry by 9 to get the year. Just see, how...
