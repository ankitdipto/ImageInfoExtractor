Chapter 14: Operations On Bits 493

 

year = 1980 + (date >> 9);
month = ( (date << 7) >>12);
day = ( (date << 11) >>11);
printf ( “\nYear = %u ", year ) ;
printf (“Month = %u ", month) ;
printf ( "Day = %u", day) ;

}

And here is the output...

Date = 5225
Year = 1990 Month = 3 Day =9

Bitwise AND Operator

This operator is represented as &. Remember it is different than
&&, the logical AND operator. The & operator operates on two
operands. While operating upon these two operands they are
compared on a bit-by-bit basis. Hence both the operands must be
of the same type (either char or int). The second operand is often
called an AND mask. The & operator operates on a pair of bits to
yield a resultant bit. The rules that decide the value of the resultant
it are shown below:

 

 

 

First bit Second bit First bit & Second bit
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1
