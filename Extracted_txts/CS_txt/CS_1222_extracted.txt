This can be represented in a more understandable form as a ‘Truth
Table’ shown in Figure 14.8.

Figure 14.8

The example given below shows more clearly what happens while
ANDing one operand with another. The rules given in the Figure
14.8 are applied to each pair of bits one by one.

 

 

 

1} 0} 1] OF 1} Of} 1) 0 This operand when
ANDed bitwise

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1] 1] oJ of of of ifi With this operand
yields

Work through the Truth Table and confirm that the result obtaine
is really correct.

Thus, it must be clear that the operation is being performed on
individual bits, and the operation performed on one pair of bits is
