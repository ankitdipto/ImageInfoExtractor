int i= 65,j;
printf ( “\nvalue of i = %d", i) ;
j=i&32;
it(j=

printf ("\nand its fifth bit is off" ) ;
else

printf (“\nand its fifth bit is on” ) ;
j=i864;

if (J==0)
printf ( "\nwhereas its sixth bit is off" ) ;
else
printf ( "\nwhereas its sixth bit is on" ) ;
}

And here is the output...

Value of i = 65
and its fifth bit is off
whereas its sixth bit is on

In every file entry present in the directory, there is an attribute
byte. The status of a file is governed by the value of individual bits
in this attribute byte. The AND operator can be used to check the
status of the bits of this attribute byte. The meaning of each bit in
the attribute byte is shown in Figure 14.10.
