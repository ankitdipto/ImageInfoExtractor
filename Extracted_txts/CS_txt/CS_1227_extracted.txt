Now, suppose we want to check whether a file is a hidden file or
not. A hidden file is one, which is never shown in the directory,
even though it exists on the disk. From the above bit classification
of attribute byte, we only need to check whether bit number 1 is
ON or OFF.

So, our first operand in this case becomes the attribute byte of the
file in question, whereas the second operand is the 1 * 2! = 2, as
discussed earlier. Similarly, it can be checked whether the file is a
system file or not, whether the file is read-only file or not, and so
on.

The second, and equally important use of the AND operator is in
changing the status of the bit, or more precisely to switch OFF a
particular bit.
