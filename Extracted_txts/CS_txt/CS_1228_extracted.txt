498 Let Us C

 

If the first operand happens to be 00000111, then to switch OFF
bit number 1, our AND mask bit pattern should be 11111101. On
applying this mask, we get,

00000111 Original bit pattern
11111101 AND mask

00000101 — Resulting bit pattern

Here in the AND mask we keep the value of all other bits as 1
except the one which is to be switched OFF (which is purposefully
kept as 0). Therefore, irrespective of whether the first bit is ON or
OFF previously, it is switched OFF. At the same time the value 1
provided in all the other bits of the AND mask (second operand)
keeps the bit values of the other bits in the first operand unaltered.

Let’s summarize the uses of bitwise AND operator:
(a) It is used to check whether a particular bit in a number is ON

or OFF.
(b) It is used to turn OFF a particular bit in a number.

Bitwise OR Operator

Another important bitwise operator is the OR operator which is
represented as |. The rules that govern the value of the resulting bit
obtained after ORing of two bits is shown in the truth table below.

 

 

 

 

 

| 0 1
0 0 1
1 1 1
