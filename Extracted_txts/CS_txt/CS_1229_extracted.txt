Chapter 14: Operations On Bits 499

 

Using the Truth table confirm the result obtained on ORing the
two operands as shown below.

11010000 — Original bit pattern
00000111 OR mask

11010111 Resulting bit pattern

Bitwise OR operator is usually used to put ON a particular bit in a
number.

Let us consider the bit pattern 11000011. If we want to put ON bit
number 3, then the OR mask to be used would be 00001000. Note
that all the other bits in the mask are set to 0 and only the bit,
which we want to set ON in the resulting value is set to 1.

Bitwise XOR Operator

The XOR operator is represented as * and is also called an
Exclusive OR Operator. The OR operator returns 1, when any one
of the two bits or both the bits are 1, whereas XOR returns 1 only
if one of the two bits is 1. The truth table for the XOR operator is
given below.

XOR operator is used to toggle a bit ON or OFF. A number
XORed with another number twice gives the original number. This
is shown in the following program.
