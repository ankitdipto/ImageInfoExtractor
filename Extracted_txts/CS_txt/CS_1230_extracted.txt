500 Let Us C

 

main()

{
int b =50;
b=b*12;

printf ("\n%d", b) ; /* this will print 62 */

b=b*12;
printf ("\n%d", b) ; /* this will print 50 */
}

The showbits() Function

We have used this function quite often in this chapter. Now we
have sufficient knowledge of bitwise operators and hence are in a
position to understand it. The function is given below followed by
a brief explanation.

showbits (int n)

int i, k, andmask ;
for (i= 15; i>=0;i-)
andmask = 1 <<i;
k =n & andmask ;
k == 0? printf ("0") : printf ("1");
} }

All that is being done in this function is using an AND operator
and a variable andmask we are checking the status of individual
bits. If the bit is OFF we print a 0 otherwise we print a 1.

First time through the loop, the variable andmask will contain the
value 1000000000000000, which is obtained by left-shifting 1,
