program counter PC, address register AR, data register DR. and accumulator
register AC. The function of these registers is similar to the basic computer
introduced in Chap. 5 (see Fig, 5-3). The control unit has a contiol addres
register CAR and a subroutine register SBR. The control memory and its
registers are otganized as a microprogramuned control unit, as shown in
Fig. 7-2

â€œThe transfer of infarmation among the registers in the procestar is done

from AC, PC, or memory. AR can receive information from PC or DR. FC.can
receive information only from AR. The aritturetic, logic, and shift unit per-
