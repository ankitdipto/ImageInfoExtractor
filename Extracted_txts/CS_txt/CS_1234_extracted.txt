that wins in 5 or more than 5 games is awarded the Champion
of Champions trophy. If a number is entered through the

An animal could be either a canine (dog, wolf, fox, etc.), a
feline (cat, lynx, jaguar, etc.), a cetacean (whale, narwhal,
etc.) or a marsupial (koala, wombat, etc.). The information
whether a particular animal is canine, feline, cetacean, or
marsupial is stored in bit number 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively of
a integer variable called type. Bit number 4 of the variable
type stores the information about whether the animal is
Carnivore or Herbivore.

For the following animal, complete the program to determine
whether the animal is a herbivore or a carnivore. Also
determine whether the animal is a canine, feline, cetacean or a
marsupial.

struct animal

char name[30] ;
int type ;

struct animal a ={"OCELOT", 18};

The time field in the directory entry is 2 bytes long.
Distribution of different bits which account for hours, minutes
and seconds is given below. Write a function which would
receive the two-byte time entry and return to the calling
function, the hours, minutes and seconds.
