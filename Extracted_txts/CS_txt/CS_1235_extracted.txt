In order to save disk space information about student is stored
in an integer variable. If bit number 0 is on then it indicates I*
year student, bit number 1 to 3 stores II"? year, IIIâ€˜? year and
IV" year student respectively. The bit number 4 to 7 stores
stream Mechanical, Chemical, Electronics and IT. Rest of the
bits store room number. Based on the given data, write a
program that asks for the room number and displays the
information about the student, if its data exists in the array.
The contents of array are,

int data[ ] = { 273, 548, 786, 1096 };
What will be the output of the following program:

main()

{
int i= 32, j=65, k, |,m,n, 0, p;
k=i]/35; l=~-k; m=i&j;
n=j*32; j<<2; p=i>>5;
printf ("\nk = %d | = %d m = %d", k, |, m) ;
printf ( "\nn = %d 0 = %d p = %d", n, 0, p);
