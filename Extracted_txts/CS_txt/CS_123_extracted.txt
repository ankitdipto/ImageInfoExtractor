Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

The relabel operation

The basic operation RELABEL(u) applies if u is overflowing and if u.h < v.h for
all edges (u,v) € Ey. In other words, we can relabel an overflowing vertex u if
for every vertex v for which there is residual capacity from u to v, flow cannot be
pushed from u to v because v is not downhill from u. (Recall that by definition,
neither the source s nor the sink ¢ can be overflowing, and so s and f are ineligible
for relabeling.)

RELABEL (u)

1 // Applies when: v is overflowing and for all v € V such that (u,v) € Ey,
we have u.h < v.h.

2 VM Action: Increase the height of u.

3 uh = 1+4+min{v.h: (u,v) € Ef}

When we call the operation RELABEL(w), we say that vertex u is relabeled. Note
that when w is relabeled, Ey must contain at least one edge that leaves uw, so that
the minimization in the code is over a nonempty set. This property follows from
the assumption that wu is overflowing, which in turn tells us that
we= Yo fO,w) do fu, v) >0.

veV veV
Since all flows are nonnegative, we must therefore have at least one vertex v such
that (v,u).f > 0. But then, cf(u,v) > 0, which implies that (u,v) € Ey. The
operation RELABEL (u) thus gives u the greatest height allowed by the constraints
on height functions.

The generic algorithm

The generic push-relabel algorithm uses the following subroutine to create an ini-
tial preflow in the flow network.

INITIALIZE-PREFLOW(G, 5)
1 for each vertex v € G.V

2 vh=0

3 ve=0

4 for each edge (u,v) € G.E
5 (u,v).f = 0

6 sh = |G.V|

7 for each vertex v € s.Adj
8 (s,v).f = c(s,v)

9 v.e = c(s,v)

10 s.e = S.e—C(S,v)
