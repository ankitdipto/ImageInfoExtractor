550 Let Us C

[C] Attempt the following:

(a) Create an array of four function pointers. Each pointer should
point to a different function. Each of these functions should
receive two integers and return a float. Using a loop call each
of these functions using the addresses present in the array.

(b) Write a function that receives variable number of arguments,
where the arguments are the coordinates of a point. Based on
the number of arguments received, the function should display

type of shape like a point, line, triangle, etc. that can be
drawn.

(c) Write a program, which stores information about a date in a
structure containing three members—day, month and year.
Using bit fields the day number should get stored in first 5
bits of day, the month number in 4 bits of month and year in
12 bits of year. Write a program to read date of joining of 10
employees and display them in ascending order of year.

(d) Write a program to read and store information about insurance
policy holder. The information contains details like gender,
whether the holder is minor/major, policy name and duration
of the policy. Make use of bit-fields to store this information.
