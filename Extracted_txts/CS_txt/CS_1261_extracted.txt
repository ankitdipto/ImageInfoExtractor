Chapter 16: C Under Windows 537

 

95, 98, ME fall under the Consumer Windows, whereas Windows
NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003 fall under the Windows NT Family.
Consumer Windows was targeted towards the home or small office
users, whereas NT family was targeted towards business users.
Microsoft no longer provides support for Consumer Windows.
Hence in this book we would concentrate only on NT Family
Windows. So in the rest of this book whenever I refer to Windows
I mean Windows NT family, unless explicitly specified.

Before we start writing C programs under Windows let us first see
some of the changes that have happened under Windows
environment.

Integers

Under 16-bit environment the size of integer is of 2 bytes. As
against this, under 32-bit environment an integer is of 4 bytes.
Hence its range is -2147483648 to +2147483647. Thus there is no
difference between an int and a long int. But what if we wish to
store the age of a person in an integer? It would be improper to
sacrifice a 4-byte integer when we know that the number to be
stored in it is hardly going to exceed hundred. In such as case it
would be more sensible to use a short int since it is only 2 bytes
long.

The Use of typedef

Take a look at the following declarations:

COLORREF color ;
HANDLE h;
WPARAM w ;
LPARAM |;

BOOL b ;
