538 Let UsC

 

Are COLORREF, HANDLE, etc. new datatypes that have been
added in C under Windows compiler? Not at all. They are merely
typedef’s of the normal integer datatype.

A typical C under Windows program would contain several such
typedefs. There are two reasons why Windows-based C programs
heavily make use of typedefs. These are:

(a)

()

A typical Windows program is required to perform several
complex tasks. For example a program may print documents,
send mails, perform file I/O, manage multiple threads of
execution, draw in a window, play sound files, perform
operations over the network apart from normal data
processing tasks. Naturally a program that carries out so many
tasks would be very big in size. In such a program if we start
using the normal integer data type to represent variables that
hold different entities we would soon lose track of what that
integer value actually represents. This can be overcome by
suitably typedefining the integer as shown above.

At several places in Windows programming we are required
to gather and work with dissimilar but inter-related data. This
can be done using a structure. But when we define any
structure variable we are required to precede it with the
keyword struct. This can be avoided by using typedef as
shown below:

struct rect
{
int top ;
int left ;
int right ;
int bottom ;
hi
typedef struct rect RECT ;

typedef struct rect” PRECT ;
