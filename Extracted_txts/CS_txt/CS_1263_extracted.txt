Chapter 16: C Under Windows 539

 

RECT r;
PRECT pr;

What have we achieved out of this? It makes user-defined
data types like structures look, act and behave similar to
standard data types like integers, floats, etc. You would agree
that the following declarations

RECT r;
inti;

are more logical than

struct RECT r ;
inti;

Imagine a situation where each programmer typedefs the integer
to represent a color in different ways. Some of these could be as
follows:

typedef int COL ;

typedef int COLOR ;
typedef int COLOUR ;
typedef int COLORREF ;

To avoid this chaos Microsoft has done several typedefs for
commonly required entities in Windows programming. All these
have been stored in header files. These header files are provided as
part of 32-bit compiler like Visual C++.

Pointers in the 32-bit World

In a 16-bit world (like MS-DOS) we could run only one
application at a time. If we were to run another program we were
required to terminate the first one before launching the second. As
only one program (task) could run at a time this environment was
