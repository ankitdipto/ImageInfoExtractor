Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Lemma 26.15 (Vertex heights never decrease)

During the execution of the GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL procedure on a flow net-
work G = (V, E), for each vertex u € V, the height wv. never decreases. More-
over, whenever a relabel operation is applied to a vertex u, its height u.h increases
by at least 1.

Proof Because vertex heights change only during relabel operations, it suffices
to prove the second statement of the lemma. If vertex u is about to be rela-
beled, then for all vertices v such that (u,v) € Ey, we have u.h < v.h. Thus,
uh <1+min{v.h: (u,v) € Ef}, and so the operation must increase u.h. .

Lemma 26.16
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s and sink ¢. Then the execution of
GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on G maintains the attribute / as a height function.

Proof The proof is by induction on the number of basic operations performed.
Initially, / is a height function, as we have already observed.

We claim that if / is a height function, then an operation RELABEL (11) leaves h
a height function. If we look at a residual edge (w,v) € Ey that leaves u, then
the operation RELABEL(u) ensures that vu. < v. + 1 afterward. Now consider
a residual edge (w,u) that enters u. By Lemma 26.15, w.h < u.h + 1 before the
operation RELABEL(u) implies w.h < u.h + 1 afterward. Thus, the operation
RELABEL (11) leaves h a height function.

Now, consider an operation PUSH(u, v). This operation may add the edge (v, u)
to Ey, and it may remove (u,v) from Ey. In the former case, we have
v.h =u.h—1<u.h+ 1, and so h remains a height function. In the latter case,
removing (u,v) from the residual network removes the corresponding constraint,
and /i again remains a height function. .

The following lemma gives an important property of height functions.

Lemma 26.17

Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s and sink ¢, let f be a preflow
in G, and let h be a height function on V. Then there is no path from the source 5
to the sink ¢ in the residual network Gy.

Proof Assume for the sake of contradiction that Gy contains a path p from s to f,
where p = (V0, V1,---5 Ve), Yo = S, and vy = f. Without loss of generality, p
is a simple path, and sok < |V|. Fori = 0,1,..., k — 1, edge (vj, Vi41) € Ef.
Because hi is a height function, h(v;) < h(v; 41) + 1 fori =0,1,..., k —1. Com-
bining these inequalities over path p yields h(s) < h(t)+k. But because h(t) = 0,
