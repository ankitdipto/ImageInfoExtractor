out jobs like console I/O, file I/O, printing, ete. For other
operations like generating graphics, carrying out serial
communication, etc. the program has to call another set of
functions called ROM-BIOS functions.

Unfortunately the DOS functions and the BIOS functions do not
have any names. Hence to call them the program had to use a
mechanism called interrupts. This is a messy affair since the
programmer has to remember interrupt numbers for calling
different functions. Moreover, communication with these functions
has to be done using CPU registers. This lead to lot of difficulties
since different functions use different registers for communication.
To an extent these difficulties are reduced by providing library
functions that in tum call the DOS/BIOS functions using
interrupts. But the library doesnâ€™t have a parallel function for every
DOS/BIOS function. DOS functions either call BIOS functions or
directly access the hardware.

At times the programs are needed to directly interact with the
hardware. This has to be done because either there are no
DOS/BIOS functions to do this, or if they are there their reach is
limited.

Figure 16.2 captures the essence of the DOS programming model.
