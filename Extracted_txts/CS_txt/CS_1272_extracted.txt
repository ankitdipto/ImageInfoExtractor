Inconsistent Look and Feel

Every DOS program has a different user interface that the user has
to get used to before he can start getting work out of the program.
For example, successful DOS-based software like Lotus 1-2-3,
Foxpro, Wordstar offered different types of menus. This happened
because DOS/BIOS doesnâ€™t provide any functions for creating
user interface elements like menus. As the look and feel of all
DOS based programs is different, the user takes a lot of time in
learning how to interact with the program

Messy Calling Mechanism

It is difficult to remember interrupt numbers and the registers that
are to be used for communication with DOS/BIOS functions. For
example, if we are to position the cursor on the screen using a
BIOS function we are required to remember the following details:

Interrupt number - 16

CPU Registers to be used:
AH - 2 (Service number)
DH - Row number where cursor is to be positioned
DL - Column number where cursor is to be positioned

While using these interrupt numbers and registers there is always a
chance of error.

Hardware Dependency

DOS programs are always required to bother about the details of
the hardware on which they are running. This is because for every
new piece of hardware introduced there are new interrupt numbers
and new register details. Hence DOS programmers are under the
constant fear that if the hardware on which the programs are
running changes then the program may crash.
