API functions available. They help an application to perform
various tasks such as creating a window, drawing a line,
performing file input/output, etc.

True Reuse

A C under Windows program calls several API functions during
course of its execution. Imagine how much disk space would have
been wasted had each of these functions become part of the EXE
file of each program. To avoid this, the API functions are stored in
special files that have an extension .DLL.

DLL stands for Dynamic Link Libraries. A DLL is a binary file
that provides a library of functions. The functions present in DLLs
can be linked during execution. These functions can also be shared
between several applications running in Windows. Since linking is
done dynamically the functions do not become part of the
executable file. As a result, the size of EXE files does not go out of
hand. It is also possible to create your own DLLs. You would like
to do this for two reasons:

(a) Sharing common code between different executable files.

(b) Breaking an application into component parts to provide a
way to easily upgrade applicationâ€™s components.

The Windows API functions come in three DLL files. Figure 16.3
lists these filenames along with purpose of each.
