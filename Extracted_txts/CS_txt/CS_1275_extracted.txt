Consistent Look and Feel

Consistent look and feel means that each program offers a
consistent and similar user interface. As a result, user doesn’t have
to spend long periods of time mastering a new program. Every
program occupies a window—a rectangular area on the screen. A
window is identified by a title bar. Most program functions are
initiated through the program’s menu. The display of information
too large to fit on a single screen can be viewed using scroll bars.
Some menu items invoke dialog boxes, into which the user enters
additional information. One dialog box is found in almost every
Windows program. It opens a file. This dialog box looks the same
(or very similar) in many different Windows programs, and it is
almost always invoked from the same menu option.

Once you know how to use one Windows program, you’re in a
good position to easily learn another. The menus and dialog boxes
allow user to experiment with a new program and explore its
features. Most Windows programs have both a keyboard interface
and a mouse interface. Although most functions of Windows
programs can be controlled through the keyboard, using the mouse
is often easier for many chores.
