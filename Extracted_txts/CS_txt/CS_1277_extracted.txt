Suppose the keyboard and the mouse are now replaced with a new
eyboard and mouse. Doing so would not affect the application at
all. This is because at no time does the application carry out any
direct communication with the devices. Any differences that may
e there in the new set of mouse and keyboard would be handled
the device driver and not by the application program. Similarly, if
the screen or the graphics card is replaced no change would be
required in the program. In short hardware independence at work!
At times a change of device may necessitate a change in the device
driver program, but never a change in the application.

 

Event Driven Model

When a user interacts with a Windows program a lot of events
occur. For each event a message is sent to the program and the
program reacts to it. Since the order in which the user would
interact with the user-interface elements of the program cannot be
predicted the order of occurrence of events, and hence the order of
messages, also becomes unpredictable. As a result, the order of
