Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

 

adding the first one. For example, to derive Silly(Pigler)from ShyBabyPigOfSmallBrain(Piglet),
we would have to write

Vb ShyBabyPigOfSmallBrain(b)=> Silly(b)

This is a sign that something is wrong. The first fact about silliness is of no help in a similar
situation. In a properly designed knowledge base, facts that were entered for one situation should
end up being used in new situations as well. As you go along, you should need fewer new facts,
and fewer new predicates. This will only happen if one writes rules at the most general level
at which the knowledge is applicable. In a good. knowledge base, BearOfVerySmallBrain(Pooh)
would be replaced by something like the following -

  

1. Pooh is a bear; bears are animals; animals are physical things

Bear(Pooh)
Vb Bear(b) = Animal(b)
Va Animal(a) > PhysicalThing(a)

These sentences help to tie knowledge about Pooh into a broader context. They also enable
knowledge to be expressed at an appropriate level of generality, depending on whether the
information is applicable to bears, animals, or all physical objects...

VAN

RelativeSize(BrainOf (Pooh), BrainOf (TypicalBear))=  Very(Small)

v

Pooh has a very small brain.

 

This provides a precise sense of "very small," which would otherwise be highly ambiguous
Is Pooh's brain very small compared to a molecule or a moon?

3. All animals (and only animals) have a brain, which is a part of the animal

Va Animal(a) = Brain(BrainOf(a))
Va PartOf(BrainOf(a), a)

This allows us to connect Pooh's brain to Pooh himself, and introduces some useful, general
vocabulary.
4, If something is part ofa physical thing, then itis also a physical thing:
Va,y PartOf(x.y)A PhysicalThing(y) = PhysicalThing(x)
This is a very general and important fact that is seldom seen in physics textbooks!
5. Animals with brains that are small (or below) relative to the normal brain size for their
species are silly.”
Va_ RelativeSize(BrainOf (a) BrainOf (TypicalMember(SpeciesOf(a))s Small
= Silly(a)

Vb Bear(b) ++ SpeciesOf (b> Ursidae
TypicalBear= ‘TypicalMember(Ursidae)

2 It is important to remember that the goal for this knowledge base was to be consistent and useful within a world of
talking stuffed animals, not to be a model of the real world. Although biologists are in agreement that brain size is not a
good predictor for silliness, the rules given here are the right ones for this world.
