The First Windows Program

To keep things simple we would begin with a program that merely
displays a “Hello” message in a message box. Here is the
program...

#include <windows.h>

int _stdcall WinMain ( HINSTANCE hinstance, HINSTANCE hPrevinstance,
LPSTR IpszCmdline, int nCmdShow )

{

MessageBox ( 0, “Hello!”, “Title”, 0 ) ;
return (0);
}

Naturally a question would come to your mind—how do I create
and run this program and what output does it produce. Firstly take
a look at the output that it produces. Here it is...

Let us now look at the steps that one needs to carry to create and
execute this program:

(a) Start VC++ from ‘Start | Programs | Microsoft Visual C++
6.0’. The VC++ IDE window will get displayed.

(b) From the File | New menu, select ‘Win32 Application’, and
give a project name, say, ‘sample1’. Click on OK.

(c) From the File | New menu, select ‘C++ Source File’, and give
a suitable file name, say, ‘sample1’. Click on OK.

(d) The ‘Win32 Application-Step 1 of 1’ window will appear.
Select ‘An empty project’ option and click ‘Finish’ button.
