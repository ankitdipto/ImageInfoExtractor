Chapter 16: C Under Windows 557

 

nCmdShow: This is an integer value that is passed to the
function. This integer tells the program whether the window
that it creates should appear minimized, as an icon, normal, or
maximized when it is displayed for the first time.

— The MessageBox( ) function pops up a message box whose
title is ‘Title’ and which contains a message ‘Hello!’.

— Returning 0 from WinMain( ) indicates success, whereas,
returning a nonzero value indicates failure.

— Instead of printing ‘Hello!’ in the message box we can print
the command line arguments that the user may supply while
executing the program. The command line arguments can be
supplied to the program by executing it from Start | Run as
shown in Figure 16.7.

Type the name of a program, folder, document, or
Internet resource, and Windows will open it for you.

c:\myapp.exe abc ijk xyz v

 

Figure 16.7

Note from Figure 16.7 that ‘myapp.exe’ is the name of our
application, whereas, ‘abe ijk xyz’ represents command line
arguments. The parameter IpszCmdline points to the string
“abe ijk xyz”. This string can be printed using the following
statement:

MessageBox ( 0, |pszCmdline, "Title", 0) ;

If the entire command line including the filename is to be
retrieved we can use the GetCommandLine( ) function.
