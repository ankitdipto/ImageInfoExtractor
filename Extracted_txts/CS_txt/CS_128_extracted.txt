Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Proof Foran overflowing vertex x, let U = {v : there exists a simple path from x
to v in Gr}, and suppose for the sake of contradiction that s ¢ U. Let U = V—U.

We take the definition of excess from equation (26.14), sum over all vertices
in U, and note that V = U UU, to obtain

We know that the quantity }*,,<y ¢(u) must be positive because e(x) > 0, x € U,
all vertices other than s have nonnegative excess, and, by assumption, s ¢ U. Thus,
we have

All edge flows are nonnegative, and so for equation (26.17) to hold, we must have
Muev Vex f(v.u) > 0. Hence, there must exist at least one pair of vertices
wu’ € U and v’ € U with f(v’,w’) > 0. But, if f(v',u’) > 0, there must be a
residual edge (u’, v’), which means that there is a simple path from x to v’ (the
path x ~+ u’ — v’), thus contradicting the definition of U. .

The next lemma bounds the heights of vertices, and its corollary bounds the
number of relabel operations that are performed in total.

Lemma 26.20

Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s and sink ¢. At any time during
the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on G, we have u.h < 2|V|—1 for all
vertices u € V.

Proof The heights of the source s and the sink ¢ never change because these
vertices are by definition not overflowing. Thus, we always have s.h = |V| and
t.h = 0, both of which are no greater than 2|V| — 1.

Now consider any vertex u € V —{s, f}. Initially, u.h = 0 < 2|V|—1. We shall
show that after each relabeling operation, we still have u.h < 2|V|—1. When w is
