Let us now understand the program. Every window enjoys certain
properties—background color, shape of cursor, shape of icon, etc.
All these properties taken together are known as ‘window class’.
The meaning of ‘class’ here is ‘type’. Windows insists that a
window class should be registered with it before we attempt to
create windows of that type. Once a window class is registered we
can create several windows of that type. Each of these windows
would enjoy the same properties that have been registered through
the window class. There are several predefined window classes.
Some of these are BUTTON, EDIT, LISTBOX, etc. Our program
has created one such window using the predefined BUTTON class.
