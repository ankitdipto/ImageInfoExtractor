The WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style is a collection of the
following styles:

WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU | WS_THICKFRAME |
WS_MINIMIZEBOX | WS_MAXIMIZEBOX

As you can make out from these macros they essentially control
the look and feel of the window being created. All these macros
are #defined in the ‘Windows.’ header file.

On executing this program a window and a message box appears
on the screen as shown in the Figure 17.2. The window and the
message box disappear as soon as we click on OK. This is because
on doing so execution of WinMain( ) comes to an end and
moreover we have made no provision to interact with the window.

You can try to remove the call to MessageBox( ) and see the
result. You would observe that no sooner does the window appear
it disappears. Thus a call to MessageBox( ) serves the similar
purpose as getch() does in sequential programming.

More Windows

Now that we know how to create a window let us create several
windows on the screen. The program to do this is given below.

#include <windows.h>

int _stdcall WinMain ( HINSTANCE hinstance, HINSTANCE hPrevinstance,
LPSTR IpszCmdLine, int nhCmdShow )
{
HWND h[10] ;
int x;

for (x =0;X<=9;X++)
{
