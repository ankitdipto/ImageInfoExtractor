elements. They govern the properties of the window. Registration
of a window class, creation of a window and displaying of a
window involves calling of API functions RegisterClassEx( ),
CreateWindow( ) and ShowWindow( ) respectively. Since all the
4 steps mentioned above would be required in almost every
program in this chapter I have written this code in a user-defined
function called InitInstance( ) in the file ‘helper.h’.

Though writing code in a header file goes against the convention I
have still done so to achieve simplicity. The complete listing of
‘helper.h’ file is available in Appendix F. Alternatively you can
download it from the following link:

As expected WinMain( ) starts off by calling the function
InitInstance( ) present in ‘helper.h’ file. This file has been
#included at the beginning of the program. Remember to copy this
file to your project directory—the directory in which you are going
to create this program.

Once the window has been created and displayed let us see how
we can interact with it.

Interaction with Window

As and when the user interacts with the wnndow—by stretching its
boundaries or clicking the buttons in the title bar, etc. a suitable
message is posted into the message queue of our application. Our
application should now pick them up from the message queue and
process them.

A message contains a message id and some other additional
information about the message. For example, a mouse click
message would contain additional information like handle to the
window with which the user has interacted, the coordinates of
