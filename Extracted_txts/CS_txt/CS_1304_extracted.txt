Chapter 17: Windows Programming 573

 

processing of the message that we have decided not to tackle. The
default processing for different message would be different. For
example on double clicking the title bar DefWindowProc( )
maximizes the window.

Actually speaking when we close the window a WM_CLOSE
message is posted into the message queue. Since we have not
handled this message the DefWindowProc( ) function gets called
to tackle this message. The DefWindowProc( ) function destroys
the window and places a WM_DESTROY message in the
message queue. As discussed earlier, in WndProc( ) we have
made the provision to terminate the application on encountering
WM_DESTROY.

That brings us to the end of a lonnngggg explanation! You can
now heave a sigh of relief. I would urge you to go through the
above explanation till the time you are absolutely sure that you
have understood every detail of it. A very clear understanding of it
would help you make a good Windows programmer. For your
convenience I have given a flowchart of the entire working in
Figure 17.5.
