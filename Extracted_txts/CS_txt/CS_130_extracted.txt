Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Lemma 26.23 (Bound on nonsaturating pushes)
During the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on any flow network G =
(V, E), the number of nonsaturating pushes is less than 4|V|? (|V| + |E])-

Proof Define a potential function ® = 5°,..¢).9 V-/. Initially, @ = 0, and the
value of ® may change after each relabeling, saturating push, and nonsaturating
push. We will bound the amount that saturating pushes and relabelings can con-
tribute to the increase of ®. Then we will show that each nonsaturating push must
decrease ® by at least 1, and will use these bounds to derive an upper bound on the
number of nonsaturating pushes.

Let us examine the two ways in which ® might increase. First, relabeling a
vertex u increases ® by less than 2 |V |, since the set over which the sum is taken is
the same and the relabeling cannot increase u’s height by more than its maximum
possible height, which, by Lemma 26.20, is at most 2|V| — 1. Second, a saturating
push from a vertex u to a vertex v increases ® by less than 2|V|, since no heights
change and only vertex v, whose height is at most 2|V| — 1, can possibly become
overflowing.

Now we show that a nonsaturating push from u to v decreases ® by at least 1.
Why? Before the nonsaturating push, wu was overflowing, and v may or may not
have been overflowing. By Lemma 26.13, u is no longer overflowing after the
push. In addition, unless v is the source, it may or may not be overflowing after
the push. Therefore, the potential function ® has decreased by exactly u./, and it
has increased by either 0 or v.h. Since u.h — v.h = 1, the net effect is that the
potential function has decreased by at least 1.

Thus, during the course of the algorithm, the total amount of increase in ® is
due to relabelings and saturated pushes, and Corollary 26.21 and Lemma 26.22
constrain the increase to be less than (2|V|)(2|V|?) + Q|VI(Q|V||E)) =
4|V|? (\V| + |E)). Since © > 0, the total amount of decrease, and therefore the
total number of nonsaturating pushes, is less than 4|V|? (|V| + |E]). /

Having bounded the number of relabelings, saturating pushes, and nonsatu-
rating push, we have set the stage for the following analysis of the GENERIC-
PuUSH-RELABEL procedure, and hence of any algorithm based on the push-relabel
method.

Theorem 26.24
During the execution of GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on any flow network G =
(V, E), the number of basic operations is O(V? E).

Proof Immediate from Corollary 26.21 and Lemmas 26.22 and 26.23. .
