+ Encode a description of the specific problem instance. If the ontology is well thought
out, this step will be easy. It will mostly involve writing simple atomic sentences about
instances of concepts that are already part of the ontology.

* Pose queries to the inference procedure and get answers. This is where the reward is: we
can let the inference procedure operate on the axioms and problem-specific facts to derive
the facts we are interested in knowing.

To understand this five-step process better, we turn to some examples of its use. We first consider
the domain of Boolean electronic circuits.

8.3 THE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS DOMAIN

Within the domain of discrete digital electronic circuits, we would like to analyze the circuit
shown in Figure 8.1. The circuit purports to be a one-bit full adder, where the first two inputs
are the two bits to be added, and the third input is a carry bit. The first output is the sum, and the
second output is a carry bit for the next adder. The goal is to provide an analysis that determines
ifthe circuit is in fact an adder, and that can answer questions about the value of current flow at
various points in the circuit.) We follow the five-step process for knowledge engineering.

two AND gates and one OR gate. The inputs are bit values to be added, and the outputs are the
sum bit and the carry bit.

 

 

 

Decide what to talk about

Digital circuits are composed of wires and gates. Signals flow along wires to the input terminals
of gates, and each gate produces a signal on the output terminal that flows along another wire.
