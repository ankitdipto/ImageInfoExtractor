is determined from the D input. The relationship can be expressed by a
characteristic equation:

Qt+1)=D

This means that the Q output of the flip-flop receives its value from the D input
every time that the clock signal goes through a transition from 0 to 1.

‘Note that no input condition exists that will leave the state of the D
flip-flop unchanged. Although a D flip-flop has the advantage of having only
one input (excluding C), ithas the disad vantage that its characteristic table does
not have a “no change” condition Q(¢ + 1) = Q(t). The “no change” condition
can be accomplished either by disabling the clock signal or by feeding the
output back into the input, so that clock pulses keep the state of the flip-flop
unchanged.

JK Flip-Flop

‘A JK flip-flop is a refinement of the SR flip-flop in that the indeterminate
condition of the SR type is defined in the JK type. Inputs J and K behave like
inputs S and R to set and clear the flip-flop, respectively. When inputs J and
K are both equal to 1, a clock transition switches the outputs of the flip-flop
to their complement state.

The graphic symbol and characteristic table of the JK flip-flop are shown
in Fig. 1-21. The J input is equivalent to the $ (set) input of the SR flip-flop,
and the K input is equivalent to the R (clear) input. Instead of the indeterminate
condition, the JK flip-flop has a complement condition Q¢t + 1) = Q’(#) when
both J and K are equal to 1.

T Fip-Flop

Another type of flip-flop found in textbooks is the T (toggle) flip-flop. This
flip-flop, shown in Fig. 1-22, is obtained from a JK type when inputs J and K
are connected to provide a single input designated by T. The T flip-flop
