in the hbr variable. Next we have selected this brush in the DC.
The handle of the default brush in DC is collected in the holdbr
variable.

Once we have selected the brush into the DC we are ready to draw
the shapes. For drawing the line we have used MoveToEx( ) and
LineTo( ) API functions. Similarly for drawing a rectangle we
have used the Rectangle() function.

The RoundRect( ) function draws a rectangle with rounded
corners. In RoundRect ( x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ), x1, y1 represents
the x and y-coordinates of the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
Likewise, x2, y2 represent coordinates of the bottom right corner
of the rectangle. x3, y3 specify the width and height of the ellipse
used to draw the rounded corners.

Note that rectangle and the rounded rectangle are drawn from x1,
yl up to x2-1, y2-1.

Parameters of Ellipse( ) specify coordinates of bounding rectangle
of the ellipse.

The Pie( ) function draws a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an
elliptical are whose center and two endpoints are joined by lines.
The center of the arc is the center of the bounding rectangle
specified by x1, y1 and x2, y2. In Pie( x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4,
y4 ), x1, y1 and x2, y2 specify the x and y-coordinates of the upper
left corner and bottom right corner respectively, of the bounding
rectangle. x3, y3 and x4, y4 specify the x and y-coordinates of the
areâ€™s starting point and ending point respectively.

In Polygon ( IpPoints, nCount ), IpPoints points to an array of
points that specifies the vertices of the polygon. Each point in the
array is a POINT structure. nCount specifies the number of
vertices stored in the array. The system closes the polygon
automatically, if necessary, by drawing a line from the last vertex
to the first.
