590 Let UsC

 

Once we are through with drawing the shapes the old brush is
selected back in the DC and then the brush created by us is deleted
using DeleteObject( ) function.

Types of Pens

In the previous program we have used the default solid black pen
of thickness 1 pixel. We can create pens of different style, color
and thickness to do our drawing. The following OnPaint( )
handler shows how this can be achieved.

void OnPaint ( HWND hWnd )
{
HDC hdc ;
PAINTSTRUCT ps ;
HPEN hpen ;
HGDIOBJ holdpen ;

hdc = BeginPaint ( hWnd, &ps ) ;

hpen = CreatePen (PS_DASH, 1, RGB ( 255, 0,0) );
holdpen = SelectObject ( hdc, hpen ) ;

MoveToEx (hdc, 10, 10, NULL ) ;
LineTo ( hdc, 500, 10) ;

SelectObject ( hdc, holdpen ) ;
DeleteObject ( hpen ) ;

hpen = CreatePen (PS_DOT, 1, RGB (255, 0,0));
holdpen = SelectObject (hdc, hpen ) ;

MoveToEx (hdc, 10, 60, NULL ) ;
LineTo ( hdc, 500, 60) ;

SelectObject ( hdc, holdpen ) ;
DeleteObject ( hpen ) ;
