A new pen can be created using the CreatePen( ) API function.
This function needs three parameters—pen style, pen thickness
and pen color. Different macros like PS_SOLID, PS_DOT, etc.
have been defined in ‘windows.h’ to represent different pen styles.
Note that for pen styles other than PS_SOLID the pen thickness
has to be 1 pixel.

Types of Brushes

The way we can create different types of pens, we can also create
three different types of brushes. These are—solid brush, hatch
brush and pattern brush. Let us now write a program that shows
how to build these brushes and then use them to fill rectangles.
Here is the OnPaint( ) handler which achieves this.

void OnPaint ( HWND hWnd )
{
HDC hdc ;
PAINTSTRUCT ps ;

HBRUSH hbr ;
