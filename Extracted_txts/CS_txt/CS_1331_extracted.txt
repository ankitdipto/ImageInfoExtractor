Figure 18.4

 

In the OnPaint( ) handler we have drawn three rectangles—first
using a solid brush, second using a hatched brush and third using a
pattern brush. Creating and using a solid brush and hatched brush
is simple. We simply have to make calls to CreateSolidBrush( )
and CreateHatchBrush( ) respectively. For the hatch brush we
have used the style HS_CROSS. There are several other styles
defined in ‘windows.h’ that you can experiment with.

 

For creating a pattern brush we need to first create a bitmap
(pattern). Instead of creating this pattern, we have used a
readymade bitmap file. You can use any other bitmap file present
on your hard disk.

Bitmaps, menus, icons, cursors that a Windows program may use
are its resources. When the compile such a program we usually
want these resources to become a part of our EXE file. If so done
we do not have to ship these resources separately. To be able to
use a resource (bitmap file in our case) it is not enough to just copy
it in the project directory. Instead we need to carry out the steps
mentioned below to add a bitmap file to the project.

(a) From the ‘Insert’ menu option of VC++ 6.0 select the
‘Resource’ option.
