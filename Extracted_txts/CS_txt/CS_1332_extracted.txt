Chapter 18: Graphics Under Windows 595

 

(b) From the dialog that pops up select ‘bitmap’ followed by the
import button.

(c) Select the suitable .bmp file.

(d) From the ‘File’ menu select the save option to save the
generated resource script file (Scriptl.rc). When we select
‘Save’ one more file called ‘resource.h’ also gets created.

(e) Add the ‘Scriptl.rc’ file to the project using the Project | Add
to Project | Files option.

While using the bitmap in the program it is always referred using
an id. The id is #defined in the file ‘resource.h’. Somewhere
information has to be stored linking the id with the actual .bmp file
on the disk. This is done in the ‘Scriptl.rc’ file. We need to
include the ‘resource.h’ file in the program.

To create the pattern brush we first need to load the bitmap in
memory. We have done this using the LoadBitmap( ) API
function. The first parameter passed to this function is the handle
to the instance of the program. When InitInstance( ) function is
called from WinMain( ) it stores the instance handle in a global
variable hInst. We have passed this hInst to LoadBitmap( ). The
second parameter passed to it is a string representing the bitmap.
This string is created from the resource id using the
MAKEINTRESOURCE macro. The LoadBitmap( ) function
returns the handle to the bitmap. This handle is then passed to the
CreatePatternBrush( ) function. This brush is then selected into
the DC and then a rectangle is drawn using it.

Note that if the size of the bitmap is bigger than the rectangle
being drawn then the bitmap is suitably clipped. On the other hand
if the bitmap is smaller than the rectangle it is suitably replicated.

While doing the clean up firstly the brush is deleted followed by
the bitmap.
