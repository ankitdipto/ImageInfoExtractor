Code and Resources

A program consists of both instructions and static data. Static data
is that portion of the program which is not executed as machine
instructions and which does not change as the program executes.
Static data are character strings, data to create fonts, bitmaps, etc.
The designers of Windows wisely decided that static data should
be handled separately from the program code. The Windows term
for static data is ‘Resource data’, or simply ‘Resources’. By
separating static data from the program code the creators of
Windows were able to use a standard C/C++ compiler to create the
code portion of the finished Windows program, and they only had
to write a ‘Resource compiler’ to create the resources that
Windows programs use. Separating the code from the resource
data has other advantages like reducing memory demands and
making programs more portable. It also means that a programmer
can work on a program’s logic, while a designer works on how the
program looks.

Freehand Drawing, the Paintbrush Style

Even if you are knee high in computers I am sure you must have
used PaintBrush. It provides a facility to draw a freehand drawing
using mouse. Let us see if we too can achieve this. We can indicate
where the freehand drawing begins by clicking the left mouse
button. Then as we move the mouse on the table with the left
mouse button depressed the freehand drawing should get drawn in
the window. This drawing should continue till we do not release
the left mouse button.

The mouse input comes in the form of messages. For free hand
drawing we need to tackle three mouse messages—
WM_LBUTTONDOWN for left button click,
WM_MOUSEMOVE for mouse movement and
WM_LBUTTONUP for releasing the left mouse button. Let us
now see how these messages are tackled for drawing freehand. The
