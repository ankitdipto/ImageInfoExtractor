Mi FreeHand

 

Figure 18.5

It appears that for drawing the freehand we should simply receive
the mouse coordinates as it is moved and then highlight the pixels
at these coordinates using the SetPixel( ) API function. However,
if we do so the freehand would be broken at several places. This is
because usually the mouse is dragged pretty fast whereas the
mouse move messages wonâ€™t arrive so fast. A solution to this
problem is to construct the freehand using small little line
segments. This is what has been done in our program. These lines
are so small is size that you would not even recognize that the
freehand has been drawn by connecting these small lines.
