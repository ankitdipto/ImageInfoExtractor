Chapter 18: Graphics Under Windows 601

 

start getting mouse messages. So our window would not receive
any messages. If this has to be avoided then we should ensure that
our window continues to receive mouse messages even when the
cursor goes out of the client area of our window. The process of
doing this is known as mouse capturing.

We have captured the mouse in OnLButtonDown( ) handler by
calling the API function SetCapture( ). As a result, the program
continues to respond to mouse events during freehand drawing
even if the mouse is moved outside the client area. In the
OnLButtonUp( ) handler we have released the captured mouse by
calling the ReleaseCapture( ) API function.

Device Context, a Closer Look

Now that we have written a few programs and are comfortable
with idea of selecting objects like font, pen and brush into the DC,
it is time for us to understand how Windows achieves the device
independent drawing using the concept of DC. In fact a DC is
nothing but a structure that holds handles of various drawing
objects like font, pen, brush, ete. A screen DC and its working is
shown in Figure 18.6.
