Figure 18.6

You can make following observations from Figure 18.6:

(a) The DC doesnâ€™t hold the drawing objects like pen, brush, etc.
It merely holds their handles.
(b) With each DC a default monochrome bitmap of size 1 pixel x
1 pixel is associated.
(c) Default objects like black pen, white brush, etc. are shared by
different DCs in same or different applications.
