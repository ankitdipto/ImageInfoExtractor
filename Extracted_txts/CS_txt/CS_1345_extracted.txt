Chapter 18: Graphics Under Windows 605

 

the bitmap of memory DC is transferred to screen DC using
BitBlt( ) function.

Let us now take a look at the program that puts all these concepts
in action. The program merely displays the image of a vulture in a
window. Here is the code...

void OnPaint ( HWND hWnd )

{

}

HDC hdc ;

HBITMAP hbmp ;
HDC hmemdc ;
HGDIOBJ holdbmp ;
PAINTSTRUCT ps ;

hdc = BeginPaint (hWnd, &ps ) ;
hbmp = LoadBitmap ( hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE (IDB_BITMAP1 )) ;

hmemdc = CreateCompatibleDC ( hdc) ;
holdbmp = SelectObject ( hmemdc, hbmp ) ;

BitBIt ( hdc, 10, 20, 190, 220, hmemdc, 0, 0, SRCCOPY ) ;
EndPaint ( hWnd, &ps) ;
SelectObject (hmemdc, holdbmp ) ;

DeleteObject ( hbmp ) ;
DeleteDC (hmemdc) ;

On executing the program we get the window shown in Figure
18.7.
