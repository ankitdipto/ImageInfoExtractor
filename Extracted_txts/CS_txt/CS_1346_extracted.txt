As usual we begin our drawing activity in OnPaint( ) by first
getting the screen DC using the BeginPaint( ) function. Next we
have loaded the vulture bitmap image in memory by calling the
LoadBitmap( ) function. Its usage is similar to what we saw while
creating a pattern brush in an earlier section of this chapter. Then
we have created a memory device context and made its properties
compatible with that of the screen DC. To do this we have called
the API function CreateCompatibleDC( ). Note that we have
passed the handle to the screen DC to this function. The function
in turn returns the handle to the memory DC. After this we have
selected the loaded bitmap into the memory DC. Lastly, we have
performed a bit block transfer (a bit by bit copy) from memory DC
to screen DC using the function BitBIt( ). As a result of this the
vulture now appears in the window.

We have made the call to BitBIt( ) as shown below:

BitBIt (hdc, 10, 20, 190, 220, hmemdc, 0, 0, SRCCOPY ) ;
