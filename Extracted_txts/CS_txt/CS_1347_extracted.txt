Then, the connections between them:

Pose queries to the inference procedure

What combinations of inputs would cause the first output of C, (the sum bit) to be off and the
second output of C\ (the carry bit) to be on?
3 ij.i2,13 SignalUn(l,C\)) =i\ A SignalUn(2, C\)F tz A signal(In3,C0) = 13
A Signal(Out(1, CO)=OffA Signal(Out(2,CO)=On
The answer is
G=On Ah =On An =Off)V
(i= On A 1) = Off Als =On) V
(i, = Off A ix = On A ix = On)
What are the possible sets of values of all the terminals for the adder circuit?
Fij,t2.13, 01,02 Signaldn(, C))F il A Signaldn(2,CO) =i
A Signal(In(3,, Ft A Signal(Our(, CO) =01 A Signal(Out(2,CO)=02
This final query will return a complete input/output table for the device, which can be used to
check that it does in fact add its inputs correctly. This is a simple example of circuit verification.
We can also use the definition of the circuit to build larger digital systems, for which the same
kind of verification procedure can be carried out (see Exercises 8,1 and 8.3). Many domains are
amenable to the same kind of structured knowledge-base development, in which more complex
concepts are defined on top of simpler concepts.

 

84 GENERAL ONTOLOGY

This section is about a general ontology that incorporates decisions about how to represent a
broad selection of objects and relations. It is encoded within first-order logic, but makes many
ontological commitments that first-order logic does not make. A general ontology is rather more
demanding to construct, but once done has many advantages over special-purpose ontologies.
Consider again the ontology for circuits in the previous section. It makes a large number of
simplifying assumptions. For example, time is omitted completely. Signals are fixed, and there is
no propagation of signals. The structure of the circuit remains constant. Now we could take a step
toward generality by considering signals at particular times, and including the wire lengths and
propagation delays in wires and devices. This would allow us to simulate the timing properties
