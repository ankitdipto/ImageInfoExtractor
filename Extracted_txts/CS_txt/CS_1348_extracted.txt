Chapter 18: Graphics Under Windows 607

 

Let us now understand its parameters. These are as under:
hdc — Handle to target DC where the bitmap is to be blitted
10, 20 — Position where the bitmap is to be blitted

190, 220 — Width and height of bitmap being blitted

0, 0 — Top left corner of the source image. If we give 10, 20 then
the image from 10, 20 to bottom right corner of the bitmap would
get blitted.

SRCCOPY — Specifies one of the raster-operation codes. These
codes define how the color data for the source rectangle is to be
combined with the color data for the destination rectangle to
achieve the final color. SRCCOPY means that the pixel color of
source should be copied onto the destination pixel of the target.

Animation at Work

Speed is the essence of life. So having the ability to display a
bitmap in a window is fine, but if we can add movement and sound
to it then nothing like it. So let us now see how to achieve this
animation and sound effect.

If we are to animate an object in the window we need to carry out
the following steps:

(a) Create an image that is to be animated as a resource.

(b) Prepare the image for later display.

(c) Repeatedly display this prepared image at suitable places in
the window taking care that when the next image is displayed
the previous image is erased.

(d) Check for collisions while displaying the prepared image.

Let us now write a program that on execution makes a red colored
ball move in the window. As the ball strikes the walls of the
