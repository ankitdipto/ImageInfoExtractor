Chapter 18: Graphics Under Windows 611

 

The WM_CREATE message arrives whenever a new window is
created. Since usually a window is created only once, the one-time
activity that is to be carried out in a program is usually done in
OnCreate( ) handler. In our program to make the ball move we
need to display it at different places at different times. To do this it
would be necessary to blit the ball image several times. However,
we need to load the image only once. As this is a one-time activity
it has been done in the handler function OnCreate( ).

You are already familiar with the steps involved in preparing the
image for blittngâ€”loading the bitmap, creating a memory DC,
making it compatible with screen DC and selecting the bitmap in
the memory DC.

Apart from preparing the image for blitting we have also done
some intialialisations like setting up values in some variables to
indicate the initial position of the ball. We have also called the
SetTimer( ) function. This function tells Windows to post a
message WM_TIMER into the message queue of our application
every 50 milliseconds.

WM_TIMER and OnTimer()

If we are to perform an activity at regular intervals we have two
choices:

(a) Use a loop and monitor within the loop when is it time to
perform that activity.

(b) Use a Windows mechanism of timer. This mechanism when
used posts a WM_TIMER message at regular intervals to our
application.

The first method would seriously hamper the responsiveness of the
program. If the control is within the loop and a new message
arrives the message would not get processed unless the control
goes out of the loop. The second choice is better because it makes
the program event driven. That is, whenever WM_TIMER arrives
