generate true random numbers. To ensure that we do get true
random numbers, somehow we need to tie the random number
generation with time, as time of each execution of our
program would be different. This has been achieved by
making the call

srand (time (NULL )) ;

Here time( ) is function that returns the time. We have further
passed this time to the srand() function.

(f) To be able to use rand( ) and srand( ) functions include the
file ‘stdlib.h’. Similarly for time( ) function to work include
the file ‘time.h’.

(g) In the call to the PlaySound( ) function the first parameter is
the name of the wave file that is to be played. If first
parameter is filename then the second has to be NULL. The
third parameter is a set of flags. SND_FILENAME indicates
that the first parameter is the filename, whereas
SND_ASYNC indicates that the sound should be played in
the background.

(a) To be able to use the PlaySound( ) function we need to link
the library ‘winmm.lib’. This is done by using ‘Project |
Settings’ menu item. On selection of this item a dialog pops
up. In the ‘Link’ tab of this dialog mention the name
‘winmm. lib’ in the ‘Object / Library modules’ edit box.

@) When the application terminates we have to instruct Windows
not to send WM_TIMER messages to our application any
more. For this we have called the KillTimer( ) API function
passing to it the ID of the timer.

The biggest hurdle in Windows programming is a sound
understanding of its programming model. In this chapter and in the
