last two I have tried to catch the essence of Windowsâ€™ Event
Driven Programming model. Once you have understood it
thoroughly rest is just a matter of understanding and calling the
suitable API functions to get your job done. Windows API is truly
an endless world. It covers areas like Networking, Internet
programming, Telephony, Drawing and Printing, Device I/O,
Imaging, Messaging, Multimedia, Windowing, Database
programming, Shell programming, to name a few. The programs
that we have written have merely scratched the surface. No matter
how many programs that we write under Windows, several still
remain to be written. The intention of this chapter was to unveil
before you, to give you the first glimpse of what is possible under
Windows. The intention all along was not to catch fish for you but
to show you how to catch fish so that you can do fishing all your
life. Having made a sound beginning, rest is for you to explore.
Good luck and happy fishing!

Summary

(a) In DOS, programmers had to write separate graphics code for
every new video adapter. In Windows, the code once written
works on any video adapter.

(b) A Windows program cannot draw directly on an output device
like screen or printer. Instead, it draws to the logical display
surface using device context.

(c) When the window is displayed for the first time, or when it is
moved or resized OnPaint( ) handler gets called.

(d) It is necessary to obtain the device context before drawing
text or graphics in the client area.

G) A device context is a structure containing information
required to draw on a display surface. The information
includes color of pen and brush, screen resolution, color
palettes, etc.

(e) To draw using a new pen or brush it is necessary to select
them into the device context.
