happy in knowing the things the way they are under

Windows and those who wish to know why the things are
the way they are. This chapter is for the second breed of
programmers. They are the real power users of Windows. Because
it is they who first understand the default working of different
mechanisms that Windows uses and then are able to make those
mechanisms work to their advantage. The focus here would be
restricted to mechanisms that are involved in interaction with the
hardware under the Windows world. Read on and I am sure you
would be on your path to become a powerful Windows
programmer.

T here are two types of Windows programmers those who are

Hardware Interaction

Primarily interaction with hardware suggests interaction with
peripheral devices. However, its reach is not limited to interaction
with peripherals. The interaction may also involve communicating
with chips present on the motherboard. Thus more correctly,
interaction with hardware would mean interaction with any chip
other than the microprocessor. During this interaction one or more
of the following activities may be performed:

(a) Reacting to events that occur because of user’s interaction
with the hardware. For example, if the user presses a key or
clicks the mouse button then our program may do something.

(b) Reacting to events that do not need explicit user’s interaction.
For example, on ticking of a timer our program may want to
do something.

(c) Explicit communication from a program without the
occurrence of an event. For example, a program may want to
send a character to the printer, or a program may want to
read/write the contents of a sector from the hard disk.
