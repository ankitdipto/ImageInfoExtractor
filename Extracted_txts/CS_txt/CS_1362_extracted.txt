Chapter 19: Interaction With Hardware 619

 

Let us now see how this interaction is done under different
platforms.

Hardware Interaction, DOS Perspective

Under DOS whenever an external event (like pressing a key or
ticking of timer) occurs a signal called hardware interrupt gets
generated. For different events there are different interrupts. As a
reaction to the occurrence of an interrupt a table called Interrupt
Vector Table (IVT) is looked up. IVT is present in memory. It is
populated with addresses of different BIOS routines during
booting. Depending upon which interrupt has occurred the
Microprocessor picks the address of the appropriate BIOS routine
from IVT and transfers execution control to it. Once the control
reaches the BIOS routine, the code in the BIOS routine interacts
with the hardware. Naturally, for different interrupts different
BIOS routines are called. Since these routines serve the interrupts
they are often called ‘Interrupt Service Routines’ or simply ISRs.

Refer Figure 19.1 to understand this mechanism.
