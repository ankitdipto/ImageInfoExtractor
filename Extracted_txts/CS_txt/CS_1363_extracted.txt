If we want that instead of the default ISR our routine should get
called then it is necessary to store the address of this routine in
IVT. Once this is done whenever a hardware interrupt occurs our
routineâ€™s address from IVT is picked up and the control is
transferred to our routine. For example, we may register our ISR in
IVT to gain finer control over the way key-hits from the keyboard
are tackled. This finer control may involve changing codes of keys
or handling hitting of multiple keys simultaneously.

Explicit communication with the hardware can be done in four
different ways. These are shown in Figure 19.2.
