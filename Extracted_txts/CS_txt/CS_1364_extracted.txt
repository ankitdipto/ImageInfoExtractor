Let us now discuss the pros and cons of using these different
methods to interact with the hardware.

(a) Calling DOS Functions

To interact with the hardware a program can call DOS
functions. These functions can either directly interact with the
hardware or they may call BIOS functions which in tum
interact with the hardware. As a result, the programmer is not
required to know all the hardware details to be able to interact
with it. However, since DOS functions do not have names
they have to be called through the mechanism of interrupts.
This is difficult since the programmer has to remember
interrupt service numbers for calling different DOS functions.
Moreover, communication with these functions has to be done
using CPU registers. This leads to lot of difficulties since
different functions use different registers for communication.
So one has to know details of different CPU registers, how to
use them, which one to use when, etc.
