ciated with an AC operation must also be connected to the arithmetic logic shift
unit in a similar fashion.

Microprogeam Sequencer

The basic components of a microprogrammed control unit are the control
memory and the circuits that select the next address. The address selection part
is called a microprogram sequencer. A microprogram sequencer can be con-
structed with digital functions to suit a particular application. However, just
as there are large ROM units available in integrated circuit packages, so are
general-purpose sequencers suited for the construction of microprogram con-
trol units. To guarantee a wide range of acceptability, an integrated circuit
sequencer must provide an internal organization that can be adapted to a wide
range of applications.
