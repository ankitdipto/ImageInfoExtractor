would fail on processors which do not use IDT, thereby
compromising portability of device drivers.

Refer Figure 19.3 for understanding the interrupt handling
mechanism under Windows.

If we are to gain finer control while reacting to interrupts we
would be required to write a device driver containing a new ISR to
0 so.

Under Windows explicit communication with hardware is much
ifferent than the way it was done under DOS. This is primarily
because under Windows every device is shared amongst multiple
applications running in memory. To avoid conflict between
ifferent programs accessing the same device simultaneously
