Chapter 19: Interaction With Hardware 625

 

Windows does not permit an application program to directly
access any of the devices. Instead it provides several API functions
to carry out the interaction. These functions have names so calling
them is much easier than calling DOS/BIOS functions. When we
call an API function to interact with a device, it in turn accesses
the device driver program for the device. It is the device driver
program that finally accesses the device. There is a standard way
in which an application can communicate with the device driver. It
is device driver’s responsibility to ensure that multiple requests
coming from different applications are handled without causing
any conflict. In the sections to follow we would see how to
communicate with the device driver to be able to interact with the
hardware.

One last question—won’t the API change if a new device comes
into existence? No it won’t. That is the beauty of the Windows
architecture. All that would change is the device driver program
for the new device. The API functions that we would need to
interact with this new device driver would remain same. This is
shown in Figure 19.4
