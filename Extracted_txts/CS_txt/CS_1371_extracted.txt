Communication with Storage Devices

Since DOS is commercially dead the rest of the chapter would
focus on communication with the devices under Windows
platform. We would illustrate this with the help of several
programs.

Let us begin with the one that interacts with the simplest storage
device, namely the floppy disk. Rather than the physical structure
of the floppy disk it is the way the stored information is laid out
and managed that concerns programmers most. Let us understand
how the information is laid out on a floppy disk. Each floppy disk
consists of four logical partsâ€”Boot Sector, File Allocation Table
(FAT), Directory and Data space. Of these, the Boot Sector
contains information about how the disk is organized. That is, how
many sides does it contain, how many tracks are there on each
side, how many sectors are there per track, how many bytes are
there per sector, etc. The files and the directories are stored in the
Data Space. The Directory contains information about the files like
its attributes, name, size, etc. The FAT contains information about
where the files and directories are stored in the data space. Figure
19.5 shows the four logical parts of a 1.44 MB disk.
