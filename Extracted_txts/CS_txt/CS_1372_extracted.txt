With the logical structure of the floppy disk behind us let us now
write a program that reads the boot sector of a floppy disk and
displays its contents on the screen. But why on earth would we
ever like to do this? Well, thatâ€™s what all Windows-based Anti-
viral softwares do when they scan for boot sector viruses. A good
enough reason for us to add the capability to read a boot sector to
our knowledge! Here is the program...

# include <stdafx.h>

# include <windows.h>
# include <stdio.h>

# include <conio.h>

# pragma pack (1)
struct boot

BYTE jump [3];
