Chapter 19: Interaction With Hardware 631

 

Once the contents of the boot sector have been read into the
structure variable b we have displayed the first few of them on the
screen using printf( ). If you wish you can print the rest of the
contents as well.

The ReadSector() Function

With the preliminaries over let us now concentrate on the real stuff
in this program, i.e. the ReadSector( ) function. This function
begins by making a call to the CreateFile( ) API function as
shown below:

h=CreateFile (src, GENERIC_READ,
FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, 0) ;

The CreateFile( ) API function is very versatile. Anytime we are
to communicate with a device we have to firstly call this API
function. The CreateFile( ) function opens the specified device as
a file. Windows treats all devices just like files on disk. Reading
from this file means reading from the device.

The CreateFile( ) API function takes several parameters. The first
parameter is the string specifying the device to be opened. The
second parameter is a set of flags that are used to specify the
desired access to the file (representing the device) about to be
opened. By specifying the GENERIC_READ flag we have
indicated that we just wish to read from the file (device). The third
parameter specifies the sharing access for the file (device). Since
floppy drive is a shared resource across all the running
applications we have specified the FILE_LSHARE_READ flag. In
general while interacting with any hardware the sharing flag for
the file (device) must always be set to this value since every piece
of hardware is shared amongst all the running applications. The
fourth parameter indicates security access for the file (device).
Since we are not concemed with security here we have specified
the value as 0. The fifth parameter specifies what action to take if
