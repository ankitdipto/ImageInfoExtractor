the file already exists. When using CreateFile() for device access
we must always specify this parameter as OPEN_EXISTING.
Since the floppy disk file was already opened by the OS a long
time back during the booting. The remaining two parameters are
not used when using CreateFile( ) API function for device access.
Hence we have passed a 0 value for them. If the call to
CreateFile() succeeds then we obtain a handle to the file (device).

The device file mechanism allows us to read from the file (device)
by setting the file pointer using the SetFilePointer() API function
and then reading the file using the ReadFile( ) API function. Since
every sector is 512 bytes long, to read from the n® sector we need
to set the file pointer to the 512 * n bytes from the start of the file.
The first parameter to SetFilePointer() is the handle of the device
file that we obtained by calling the CreateFile( ) function. The
second parameter is the byte offset from where the reading is to
begin. This second parameter is relative to the third parameter. We
have specified the third parameter as FILE_BEGIN which means
the byte offset is relative to the start of the file.

To actually read from the device file we have made a call to the
ReadFile() API function. The ReadFile( ) function is very easy to
use. The first parameter is the handle of the file (device), the
second parameter is the address of a buffer where the read contents
should be dumped. The third parameter is the count of bytes that
have to be read. We have specified the value as 512 * num so as to
read num sectors. The fourth parameter to ReadFile( ) is the
address of an unsigned int variable which is set up with the count
of bytes that the function was successfully able to read. Lastly,
once our work with the device is over we should close the file
(device) using the CloseHandle( ) API function.

Though ReadSector( ) doesn’t need it, there does exist a
counterpart of the ReadFile( ) function. Its name is WriteFile( ).
This API function can be used to write to the file (device). The
parameters of WriteFile( ) are same as that of ReadFile( ). Note
