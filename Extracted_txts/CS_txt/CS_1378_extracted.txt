Chapter 19: Interaction With Hardware 633

 

that when WriteFile( ) is to be used we need to specify the
GENERIC_WRITE flag in the call to CreateFile( ) API
function. Given below is the code of WriteSector( ) function that
works exactly opposite to the ReadSector() function.

void WriteSector (char “src, int ss, int num, void* buff )
{
HANDLE h;
unsigned int br ;
h =CreateFile (src, GENERIC_WRITE,
FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, 0);
SetFilePointer (h, (ss * 512), NULL, FILE_BEGIN) ;
WriteFile (h, buff, 512 * num, &br, NULL) )
CloseHandle (h);
}

Accessing Other Storage Devices

Note that the mechanism of reading from or writing to any device
remains standard under Windows. We simply need to change the
string that specifies the device. Here are some sample calls for
reading/writing from/to various devices:

     

ReadSector ( "\\\\\\a:", 0, 1, &b); /* reading from 2" floppy drive */
ReadSector ( , 1, buffer ) ; /* reading from a CD-ROM drive */
WriteSector ("W\\\ ",0, 1, &b) ; /* writing to a hard disk */

ReadSector ( "\\\\.\\physicaldriveO”, 0, 1, &b ); /* reading partition table */

Here are a few interesting points that you must note.

(a) If we are to read from the second floppy drive we should
replace A: with B: while calling ReadSector( ).

(b) To read from storage devices like hard disk drive or CD-ROM
or ZIP drive, etc. use the string with appropriate drive letter.
The string can be in the range \\.\C: to \\\Z:.
