(c) To read from the CD-ROM just specify the drive letter of the
drive. Note that CD-ROMs follow a different storage
organization known as CD File System (CDFS).

(d) The hard disk is often divided into multiple partitions. Details
like the place at which each partition begins and ends, the size
of each partition, whether it is a bootable partition or not, etc.
are stored in a table on the disk. This table is often called
‘Partition Table’. If we are to read the partition table contents
we can do so by using the string \\\physicaldrive0.

(e) Using \\\physicaldriveO we can also read contents of any
other parts of the disk. Here 0 represents the first hard disk in
the system. If we are to read from the second hard disk we
need to use 1 in place of 0.

Communication with Keyboard

Like mouse messages there also exist messages for keyboard.
These ace WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP and WM_CHAR.
Of these, WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP are sent to an
application (which has the input focus) whenever the key is
pressed and released respectively. The additional information in
case of these messages is the code of the key being pressed or
released. When we tackle WM_KEYDOWN or WM_KEYUP
we need to ourselves check the status of toggle keys like NumLock
and CapsLock and shift keys like Ctrl, Alt and Shift. If we wish to
avoid all this checking we can tackle the WM_CHAR message
instead.

What is mentioned above is the normal procedure followed by
most Windows applications. However, if we wish to go a step
further and deal with the keyboard we need to tackle it differently.
For example, suppose we are to perform one of the following jobs:

(a) Once you hit any key CapsLock should become on. Once it
becomes on it should remain permanently on.
