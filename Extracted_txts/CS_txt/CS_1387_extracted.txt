Those functions in a DLL that can be called from outside it are
called exported functions. Our DLL contains three such
functions—installhook( ), removehook( ) and KeyboardProc( ).
To indicate to the compiler that a function in a DLL is an exported
function we have to pre-qualify it with __declspec ( dllexport ).
These functions would be called from the second program. This
second program is a normal GUI application created in the same
way that we did applications in Chapters 17 and 18. The handlers
for messages WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are given
below:

I" capslocked.c */

HINSTANCE h;
void OnCreate ( HWND hWnd )
' BOOL (CALLBACK “p )();
h= LoadLibrary (“hook.dll" ) ;
if (h!= NULL)
{ p = GetProcAddress (h, “installhook" ) ;
(*p)(); F* calls installhoook( ) function */
) }
void OnDestroy ( HWND hWnd )
{ BOOL ( CALLBACK “p )();

p = GetProcAddress ( h, "removehook" ) ;
(*p)(); I calls removehoook( ) function */

FreeLibrary (h) ;
PostQuitMessage (0) ;
