Figure 26.9 Discharging a vertex y. It takes 15 iterations of the while loop of DISCHARGE to push
all the excess flow from y. Only the neighbors of y and edges of the flow network that enter or leave y
are shown. In each part of the figure, the number inside each vertex is its excess at the beginning of
the first iteration shown in the part, and each vertex is shown at its height throughout the part. The
neighbor list y.N at the beginning of each iteration appears on the right, with the iteration number
â€˜on top. The shaded neighbor is y.current. (a) Initially, there are 19 units of excess to push from y,
and y.current = s. Iterations 1,2, and 3 just advance y. current, since there are no admissible edges
leaving y. In iteration 4, y.current = NIL (shown by the shading being below the neighbor list),
and so y is relabeled and y.current is reset to the head of the neighbor list. (b) After relabeling,
vertex y has height 1. In iterations 5 and 6, edges (y,s) and (y, x) are found to be inadmissible, but
iteration 7 pushes 8 units of excess flow from y to z. Because of the push, y..current does not advance
in this iteration. (c) Because the push in iteration 7 saturated edge (), z), it is found inadmissible in
iteration 8. In iteration 9, y. current = NIL, and so vertex y is again relabeled and y. current is reset.
