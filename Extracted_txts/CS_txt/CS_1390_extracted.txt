Chapter 19: Interaction With Hardware 643

 

One last point about this program—the ‘hook.dll’ file should be
copied into the directory of the application’s EXE before executing
the EXE.

Did You Press It TT wwiiccee....

With the power of windows hooks below your belt you are into the
league of power programmers of Windows. So how about tasting
the power some bit more. How about writing a program that would
make every key pressed in any Windows application appear twice.
Here is the code for the hook procedure.

LRESULT __declspec (dllexport ) __stdcall KeyboardProc (int nCode,
WPARAM wParam, LPARAM IParam )
{

static BYTE key ;
static BOOL flag = FALSE ;

if (nCode <0)
return CallNextHookEx (hkb, nCode, wParam, IParam ) ;

if ((nCode == HC_ACTION ) &&
(( DWORD ) IParam & 0x80000000 ) == 0)

{

if ( flag == FALSE )

{
key = wParam ;
keybd_event (key , 0, KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY, 0) ;
flag = TRUE ;

}

else

{
if (key == (BYTE) wParam )

flag = FALSE ;
}

}
return CallNextHookEx ( hkb, nCode, wParam, [Param ) ;
