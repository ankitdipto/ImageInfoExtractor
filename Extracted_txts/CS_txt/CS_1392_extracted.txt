path from SBR to CAR. Note that each ofthe four inputs as well as the output
of MUX 1 contains a 7-bit address.

The truth table for the input logic Grcuit is shown in Table 7-4. Inputs f,
and fp are identical to the bit values in the BR field. The function listed in each
entry was defined in Table 7-1. The bit values for S,and Sy are determined from
the stated function and the path in the multiplexer thatestablishes the required
transfer. The subroutine register is loaded with the incremented value of CAR
daring a call microinstruction (BR = 02) provided that the status bit condition
issatished (T = 1), Thetruthtable can be used toobtain the simplified Boolean
functions for the input logic circuit:

s

 

Jil + HT
L= fT
