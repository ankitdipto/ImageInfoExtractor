(b) These programs also hide themselves from the Task Manager
so that the user cannot terminate them.

(c) The logged keys are secretly sent over the net to the malicious
users who write such programs. Once the logged keys are
known it would be possible to break into the system.

Where is This Leading

Even for a moment do not create an impression in you mind that
Windows Hooks are only for notorious activities. There are many
good things that they can be put to use for. These activities
include:

(a) Multimedia keyboards have special key like Cut, Copy, Paste,
etc. Such keyboards also come with special programs which
when installed know how to tackle these special keys. On
pressing these keys these programs use the hook mechanism
to place the simulated keys in the system message queue.

(b) Many demo programs once executed automatically move the
mouse pointer to a menu or a toolbar or any such item to
demonstrate some feature of the software. To manage these
actions a windows hook called Journal hook is used.

(c) For physically impaired persons a keyboard can be simulated
on the screen and the mouse clicks on this keyboard can be
communicated to Windows as actual key hits. This again can
be achieved using mouse and keyboard hook.

There can be many more such examples. But the above three I
believe would be ample to prove to you the constructive side of the
powerful mechanism called Windows Hooks.
