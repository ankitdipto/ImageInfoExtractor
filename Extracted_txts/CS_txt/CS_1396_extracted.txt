Hardware interaction can happen in two ways: (1) When the
user interacts with the hardware and the program reacts to it.
(2) When the program interacts with the hardware without any
user intervention.

In DOS when the user interacts with the hardware an ISR gets
called which interacts with the hardware. In Windows the
same thing is done by the device driver’s ISR.

In DOS when the program has to interact with the hardware it
can do so by using library functions, DOS/BIOS routines or
by directly interacting with the hardware. In Windows the
same thing can be done by using API functions.

Under Windows to gain finer control over the hardware we
are required to write a device driver program.

Interaction with the any device can be done using API
functions like CreateFile( ), ReadFile( ), WriteFile( ) and
CloseHandle( ).

Different strings have to be passed to the CreateFile( )
functions for interacting with different devices.

Windows provides a powerful mechanism called hooks that
can alter the flow of messages before they reach the
application.

Windows hook procedures should be written in a DLL since
they work on a system wide basis.

Windows hooks can be put to many good uses.

In MS-DOS on occurrence of an interrupt values from IDT
are used to call the appropriate kernel routine.

Under Windows on occurrence of an interrupt the kemel
routine calls the appropriate device driver’s ISR.

Under Windows an application can interact with the hardware
by directly calling its device driver’s routines.
