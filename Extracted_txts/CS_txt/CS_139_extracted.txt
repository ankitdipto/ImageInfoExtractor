Figure 26.9, continued (d) In iteration 10, (y,s) is inadmissible, but iteration 11 pushes 5 units
of excess flow from y to x. (e) Because y.current did not advance in iteration 11, iteration 12
finds (j’, x) to be inadmissible. Iteration 13 finds (y,z) inadmissible, and iteration 14 relabels ver-
tex y and resets y.current. (f) Iteration 15 pushes 6 units of excess flow from y to s. (g) Vertex y
now has no excess flow, and DISCHARGE terminates. In this example, DISCHARGE both starts and
finishes with the current pointer at the head of the neighbor list, but in general this need not be the
case.
