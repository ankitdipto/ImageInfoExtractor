but may contain different application programs, libraries,
frameworks, installation scripts, utilities, ete. Which one is better
than the other is only a matter of taste.

Linux was first developed for x86-based PCs (386 or higher).
These days it also runs on Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC,
Motorola 68000 machines (like Atari ST and Amiga), MIPS,
PowerPC, ARM, Intel Itanium, SuperH, ete. Thus Linux works on
literally every conceivable microprocessor architecture.

Under Linux one is faced with simply too many choices of Linux
distributions, graphical shells and managers, editors, compilers,
linkers, debuggers, etc. For simplicity (in my opinion) I have
chosen the following combination:

Linux Distribution - Red Hat Linux 9.0

Console Shell - BASH

Graphical Shell - KDE 3.1-10

Editor - KWrite

Compiler - GNU C and C++ compiler (gcc)

We would be using and discussing these in the sections to follow.
C Programming Under Linux

How is C under Linux any different than C under DOS or C under
Windows? Well, it is same as well as different. It is same to the
extent of using language elements like data types, control
instructions and the overall syntax. The usage of standard library
functions is also same even though the implementation of each
might be different under different OS. For example, a printf( )
would work under all OSs, but the way it is defined is likely to be
different for different OSs. The programmer however doesnâ€™t
suffer because of this simce he can continue to call printf( ) the
same way no matter how it is implemented.
