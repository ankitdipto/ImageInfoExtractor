‘ums FUNCTION,

Notice that because Tomatoes is a category, and is a member of DomesticatedSpecies, then
DomesticatedSpeciesmust be a category of categories. One can even have categories of categories
of categories, but they are not much use.

Although subclass and instance relations are the most important ones for categories, we
also want to be able to state relations between categories that are not subclasses of each other.
For example, if we just say that Males and Females are subclasses of'Animals, then we have not
said that a male cannot be a female. We say that two or more categories are disjoint if they have
no members in common. And even if we know that males and females are disjoint, we will not
know that an animal that is not a male must be a female unless we say that males and females
constitute an exhaustive decomposition of the animals. A disjoint exhaustive decomposition is
known as a partition. The following examples illustrate these three concepts:

Disjoint({Animals, Vegetables})
ExhaustiveDecomposition({Americans, Canadians, Mexicans}, NorthAmericans)
Partition({Males, Females}, Animals)

(Note that the ExhaustiveDecomposition of Northdmericans is not a Partition because some
people have dual citizenship.) The definitions of these three predicates are as follows:

Vs Disjoint(s) =

Wei.c clEsACIESAc\#e2 => Intersection(c\ , ¢2) = EmptySet)
Vs, ¢ ExhaustiveDecomposition(s,c)

Wiie€e & 3a MesAiEn)
Vs,¢ Partition(s, ¢) <= Disjoint(s)A ExhaustiveDecomposition(s,c)

  

Categories can also be defined by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for mem-
bership. For example, a bachelor is an unmarried, adult male:

Vw Bachelor(x) <= Male(x)A Adult(x) A Unmarried(x)

As we discuss in the sidebar on natural kinds, strict logical definitions for categories are not
always possible, nor always necessary.

Measures

In both scientific and commonsense theories of the world, objects have height, mass, cost, and
so on. The values that we assign for these properties are called measures. Ordinary, quantitative
measures are quite easy to represent. We imagine that the universe includes abstract "measure
objects," such as the /ength that is the length of this line segment: R--———————_—_——.
We can call this length 1.5inches, or 3.81 centimeters. Thus, the same length has different names
in our language. Logically, this can be done by combining a units function with a number. IfL;
is the name of the line segment, then we can write

Length(L;) = Inches(1.5)= Centimeters(3.81)

Conversion between units is done with sentences such as

V/. Centimeters(2.54 x. 1) =Inches(l)
Vit Centigrade(t) = Fahrenheit(32 +1.8 x ))
