KwWrite is a text editor and is a part of K Desktop environment
(KDE). Installation of Linux and KDE is discussed in Appendix H.
Once KDE is started select the following command from the
desktop panel to start KWrite:

K Menu | Accessories | More Accessories | K Write

If you face any difficulty in starting the KWrite editor please refer
Appendix H. Assuming that you have been able to start KWrite
successfully, carry out the following steps:

(a) Type the program and save it under the name ‘hello.c’.

(b) At the command prompt switch to the directory containing
‘hello.c’ using the ed command.

(c) Now compile the program using the gee compiler as shown
below:

# gcc hello.c

(d) On successful compilation gee produces a file named ‘a.out’.
This file contains the machine code of the program which can
now be executed.

(e) Execute the program using the following command.

# Ja.out

(f) Now you should be able to see the output ‘Hello Linux’ on
the screen.

Having created a Hello Linux program and gone through the edit-
compile-execute cycle once let us now turn our attention to Linux
specific programming. We will begin with processes.

Processes

Gone are the days when only one job (task) could be executed in
memory at any time. Today the modern OSs like Windows and
