The circuit can be constructed with three AND gates, an OR gate, and an

inverter.
Note that the incrementer circuit in the sequencer of Fig. 7-8 is not a

counter constructed with flip-flops but rather a combinational circuit con-
sttuched with gates. A combinational circuit incrementer can be designed by
cascading a series of haltadder crcuits (see Fig. 4-8). The output cany from
one stage must be applied to the input of the next stage. Oneinputin the first
least signifvcant stage must be equal to 1 to provide the increment-by-one
operation.

PROBLEMS F

What ia the difference between a micropracessor and a microprogyam? Is it
possible to design a microprocessor without a microprogram? Are olf mi-
croprogrammed computers also microprocessors?

Explain the difference between hardwired control and microprograsuned
control. Is it possible to have a hardwired control assoceted with a contol
‘memory?

Define the following; (a) cvicraoperstion, (b) cnicroinstruction; (€) micro-
program, (a) microcode.

‘The microprogrammed control organization shown in Fig 7-1 has the fol-
lowing propagation delay times. 40 ns to generate the next address, 10 ns
to hansfer the addveas into the contiol address register, 40 ns to access the
‘control memory ROM, 10 ns to transfer the microinstruction into the contol
data register, and 40 ns to perform the required microoperations specified
by the control word. What is the maximum dock frequency thatthe control
can use? What would the clock frequency be if the control data register is
not used?

‘The system shown in Fig. 7-2uses a control memory of 024 words of 32.bits
each. The alerainstruction has three fields as shown in the diagtam. The
microoperations field has 16 bits.

‘a, How many bits are there in the branch address field and theselect field?
