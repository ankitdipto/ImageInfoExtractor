’. If there are 16 statusbits in the system, how many bits of the branch logic
are used to select a status bit?

¢. How many bits are left to select an input for the multiplexers?

‘The control memory in Fig. 7-2 has 4096 words of 24 bits each

a. How many bits are there in the control address register?

'b. How many bits are there in each of the four inputs shown going into the
multiplexers?

¢. What are the number of inputs in each multiplexer and how many
multiplexers are needed?

Using the mapping procedure described in Fig. 7-3, give the first microin-

struction address for the following operation code: (a) 0010;(b) 1011; (€)1111.

Formulate a mapping procedure that provides eight consecutive microin-

structions for each routine. The operation code has six bits and the contral

memory has 2048 words

Explain how the mapping from an instruction code to a microinstruction

address can be done by means ofa read-only memory. Whatis the advantage

of this method compared to the one in Fig, 7-3?

Why dowe need the two multiplexers in the computer hardware configura-

tion shown in Fig. 7-4? Is there another way that information from multiple

sources can be transferred to a common destination?

Using Table 7-1, give the 9-bit microoperation field for the following micro-

operations:

a. ACHAC +1, DR-DR+1

b. PCPC +1, DR—M{AR]

« DRAC, ACHDR

Using Table 7-1, convert the following symbolic microoperations to register

transfer statements and to binary.

a. READ, INCPC

b. ACTDR, DRTAC

 ARTPC DRTAC, WRITE

‘Suppose that we change the ADD routine listed in Table7-2 to the following,

two microinstructions.

‘What should be subroutine INDR2?

‘The followings a symbolic microprogram for an instruction in the computer
defined in Sec. 7-3.

4. Specify the operation performed when the instruction is executed.
b. Convert the four microinstructions into their equivalent binary form.
