Summary

(a) Linux is a free OS whose kernel was built by Linus Trovalds
and friends.

(b) A Linux distribution consists of the kernel with source code
along with a large collection of applications, libraries, scripts,
etc.

(c) C programs under Linux can be compiled using the popular
gcc compiler.

(d) Basic scheduling unit in Linux is a ‘Process’. Processes are
scheduled by a special program called ‘Scheduler’.

(e) fork() library function can be used to create child processes.

(f) Init process is the father of all processes.

(g) execl( ) library function is used to execute another program
from within a running program,.

(h) execl( ) function overwrites the image (code and data) of the
calling process.

(i) execl() and fork() usually go hand in hand.

(j) ps command can be used to get a list of all processes.

(k)_ kill command can be used to terminate a process.

() A ‘Zombie’ is a child process that has terminated but its
parent is running and has not called a function to get the exit
code of the child process.

(m) An ‘Orphan’ is a child process whose parent has terminated.

(n) Orphaned processes are adopted by init process
automatically.

(0) A parent process can avoid creation of a Zombie and Orphan
processes using waitpid( ) function.

Exercise

[A] State True or False:

(a) We can modify the kernel of Linux OS.

(b) All distributions of Linux contain the same collection of
applications, libraries and installation scripts.

(c) Basic scheduling unit in Linux is a file.
