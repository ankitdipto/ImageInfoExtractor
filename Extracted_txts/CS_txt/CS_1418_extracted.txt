execl( ) library function can be used to create a new child
process.

The scheduler process is the father of all processes.

A family of fork( ) and exec( ) functions are available, each
doing basically the same job but with minor variations.

fork() completely duplicates the code and data of the parent
process into the child process.

fork( ) overwrites the image (code and data) of the calling
process.

fork() is called twice but returns once.

Every zombie process is essentially an orphan process.

Every orphan process is essentially an orphan process.

Answer the following:

If a program contains four calls to fork( ) one after the other
how many total processes would get created?

What is the difference between a zombie process and an
orphan process?

Write a program that prints the command line arguments that
it receives. What would be the output of the program if the
command line argument is * 7

What purpose do the functions getpid( ), getppid( ),
getpppid() serve?

Rewrite the program in the section ‘Zombies and Orphans’
replacing the while loop with a call to the sleep( ) function.
Do you observe any change in the output of the program?

How does waitpid( ) prevent creation of Zombie or Orphan
processes?
