Handling Multiple Signals

Now that we know how to handle one signal, let us try to handle
multiple signals. Here is the program to do this...

# include <unistd.h>

# include <sys/types.h>

# include <signal.h>

void inthandler ( int signum )

printf ( "\nSIGINT Receivedin" ) ;

}
void termhandler (int signum )
{
printf ( "\nSIGTERM Receivedin" ) ;
}

void conthandler (int signum )

printf ( "\nSIGCONT Receivedin" ) ;
}

int main()

{
signal ( SIGINT, inthandler ) ;
signal ( SIGTERM, termhandler ) ;
signal ( SIGCONT, conthandler ) ;

while (1)
printf ( "\Program Running" ) ;

return 0 ;
