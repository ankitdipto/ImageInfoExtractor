Section 84

General Ontology 233

Similar axioms can be written for pounds and kilograms; seconds and days; dollars and cents.
(Exercise 8.9 asks you to represent exchange rates between currencies, where those exchange
tates can vary over time.)

Measures can be used to describe objects as follows:

Mass(Tomato,2) = Kilograms(0.16)
Price(Tomato,2)= $(0.32)
Wd d€Days = Duration(d)=Hours(24)

Itis very important to be able to distinguish between monetary amounts and monetary instruments:
Vb b€DollarBills + CashValue(b)= $(1.00)

This will be useful when it comes to paying for things later in the chapter.

Simple, quantitative measures are easy to represent. There are other measures that present
more of a problem, because they have no agreed scale of values. Exercises have difficulty,
desserts have deliciousness, and poems have beauty, yet numbers cannot be assigned to these
qualities. One might, in a moment ofpure accountancy, dismiss such properties as useless for the
purpose of logical reasoning; or, still worse, attempt to impose a numerical scale on beauty. This
would be a grave mistake, because it is unnecessary. The most important aspect of measures is
not the particular numerical values, but the fact that measures can be ordered.

Although measures are not numbers, we can still compare them using an ordering symbol
such as >. For example, we might well believe that Norvig's exercises are tougher than Russell's,
and that one scores less on tougher exercises:

Vey, 2 e| £ Exercises A ez £ Exercises A Wrote(Norvige,) A Wrote(Russelle) =>
Difficulty(e) > Difficulty(e2)

Ver, ey e, £ Exercises A é2 £ Exercises A Difficulty(e\> Difficulty(e2)=>
ExpectedScore(e,) < ExpectedScore(ez)

This is enough to allow one to decide which exercises to do, even though no numerical values for
difficulty were ever used. (One does, however, have to determine who wrote which exercises.)
These sorts of monotonic relationships among measures form the basis for the field of quali-
tative physics, a subfield of AI that investigates how to reason about physical systems without
plunging into detailed equations and numerical simulations. Qualitative physics is discussed in
the historical notes section.

Composite objects

The idea that one object can be part of another is a familiar one. One's nose is part of one's head;
Romania is part of Europe; this chapter is part of this book. We use the general PartOf relation
to say that one thing is part of another. PartOf is transitive and reflexive. Objects can therefore
be grouped into PartOf hierarchies, reminiscent of the Subset hierarchy:

PartOf(Bucharest, Romania)
PartOf(Romania, EasternEurope)
PartOf(EasternEurope, Europe)

From these, given the transitivity of PartOf,we can infer that PartOf(Bucharest, Europe).
