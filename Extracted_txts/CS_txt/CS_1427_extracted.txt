In this program during each call to the signal( ) function we have
specified the address of a common signal handler named
sighandler( ). Thus the same signal handler function would get
called when one of the three signals are received. This does not
lead to a problem since the sighandler( ) we can figure out inside
the signal ID using the first parameter of the function. In our
program we have made use of the switch-case construct to print a
different message for each of the three signals.

Note that we can easily afford to mix the two methods of
registering signals in a program. That is, we can register separate
signal handlers for some of the signals and a common handler for
