SECTION 7-4 Design of Control Unit 237

‘The computer of Sec. 7-3 has the following binary microprogram:

 

Address Binary Microprogram

4. Translate it to a symbolic microprogram as in Table 7-2. (FETCH is in
address 64 and INDRCT in address 67.)

. Lista the things that will be wrong when this microprogramisexecuted
in the computer.

‘Add the followinginstructions to the computer of Sec 7-3 (EA is the effective

address). Write the symbolic microprogram for each routine as in Table 7-2.

(Note that AC must not change in value unless the instruction specifies a

change in AC.)

7-20,

Write a symbolic microprogram routine for the ISZ (increment and skip if
zero) instruction defined in Chap. 5 (Table 5-4) Use the microinstruction
format of Sec. 7-3, Note that DR = 0 status condition is not available in the
CD field of the computer defined in Sec. 7-3. However, you can exchange
AC and DR and check if AC = 0 with the Z bit

Write the symbolic microprogram routines for the BSA (branch and save
address)instructions defined in Chap. 5 (Table 54). Use the microinstruction
format of Sec. 7-3. Minimize the number of microinstructions.

‘Show how outputs 5 and 6 of decoder F3 in Fig. 7-7 are to be connected to
the program counter PC.

‘Show how a 9-bit microoperation field in a microinstruction can be divided
into subfieldsto specify 46 microoperations. How many microoperations can
bbe specified in one microinstruction?
