Figure 26.10 The action of RELABEL-TO-FRONT. (a) A flow network just before the first iteration
of the while loop. Initially, 26 units of flow leave source s. On the right is shown the initial list
L = (x,y,z), where initially w = x. Under each vertex in list Z is its neighbor list, with the current
neighbor shaded. Vertex x is discharged. It is relabeled to height 1, 5 units of excess flow are pushed
to y, and the 7 remaining units of excess are pushed to the sink r. Because x is relabeled, it moves
to the head of L, which in this case does not change the structure of L. (b) After x, the next vertex
in L that is discharged is y. Figure 26.9 shows the detailed action of discharging y in this situation.
Because y is relabeled, it is moved to the head of L. (c) Vertex x now follows y in L, and so it is
again discharged, pushing all 5 units of excess flow to f. Because vertex x is not relabeled in this
discharge operation, it remains in place in list L.
