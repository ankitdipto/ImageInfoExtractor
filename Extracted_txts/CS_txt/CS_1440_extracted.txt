therefore has only two conditions. When T = 0 (J = K = 0) adlock transition
does not change the state of the flip-flop. When T = 1 (J = K = 1) a clock
transition complements the state of the flip-flop. These conditions can be
expressed by a characteristic equation:

Edge-Triggered Flip-Flops
‘The most common type of flip-flop used to synchronize the state change during
a clock puke transition is the edge-triggered flip-flop. In this type of flip-flop,
output transitions occur at a specific level of the clock pulse. When the pulse
input level exceeds this threshold level, the inputs are locked out so that the
flip-flop is unresponsive to further changes in inputs until the clock pulse
returns to 0 and another pulse occurs. Some edge-triggered flip-flops cause a
transition on the rising edge of the clock signal (positive-edge transition), and
others cause a transition on the falling edge (negative-edge transition).
Figure 1-23(a) shows the clock pulse signal in a positive-edge-triggered
D flip-flop. The value in the D input is transferred to the Q output when the
lock makes a positive transition. The output cannot change when the clock
isin the 1 level, in the 0 level, or in a transition from the 1 level to the 0 level.
