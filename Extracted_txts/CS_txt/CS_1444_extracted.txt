even a complete list of these functions would occupy scores

of pages. However, this book would be incomplete if it has
nothing to say about standard library functions. I have tried to
reach a compromise and have given a list of standard library
functions that are more popularly used so that you know what to
search for in the manual. An excellent book dedicated totally to
standard library functions is Waite groupâ€™s, Turbo C Bible, written
by Nabjyoti Barkakti.

I et alone discussing each standard library function in detail,

Following is the list of selected standard library functions. The
functions have been classified into broad categories.
