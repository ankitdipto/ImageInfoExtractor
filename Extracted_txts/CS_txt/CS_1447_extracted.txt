Because of these limitations, we now turn to a different approach toward representing
change, which we call the event calculus, although the name is not standard. Event calculus
is rather like a continuous version of the situation-calculus "movie" shown in Figure 7.3. We
think of a particular universe as having both a "spatial" and a temporal dimension. The "spatial"
dimension ranges over all of the objects in an instantaneous "snapshot" or "cross-section" of the
universe.’ The temporal dimension ranges over time. An event is, informally, just a "chunk" of
this universe with both temporal and spatial extent. Figure 8.3 gives the general idea

Figure 83. The major entities in event calculus. fmervals such as the TivensiethCentury
contain as subevents all of the events occurring within a given time period. Ordinary events such
as WorldWarlIhave temporal and "spatial" extent.

 

 

 

Let us look at an example: World War II, referred to by the symbol WorldWarll. World
War II has parts that we refer to as subevents:”

SubEvent(BattleOfBritain, WorldWarll)
Similarly, World War II is a subevent of the twentieth century:
SubEvent( WorldWarll, TwentiethCentury)

The twentieth century is a special kind of event called an interval. An interval is an event
that includes as subevents all events occurring in a given time period. Intervals are therefore
entire temporal sections of the universe, as the figure illustrates. In situation calculus, a given
fact is true in a particular situation. In event calculus, a given event occurs during a particular
interval. The previous SubEvent sentences are examples of this kind of statement.

8 We put “spatial” in quotes because it is possible that the set of objects being considered does not include places at all.
nonetheless, it is a helpful metaphor. From now on, we will leave off the quotes
9 Note that SubZvent is a special case of the PariOfrelation, and is also transitive and reflexive
