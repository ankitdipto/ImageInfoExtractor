among their most enduring accomplishments are several

new techniques for wasting time. There is no shortage of
horror stories about programs that took twenty times to ‘debug’ as
they did to ‘write’. And one hears again and again about programs
that had to be rewritten all over again because the bugs present in
it could not be located. A typical C programmer’s ‘morning after’
is red eyes, blue face and a pile of crumpled printouts and dozens
of reference books all over the floor. Bugs are C programmer's
birthright. But how do we chase them away. No sure-shot way for
that. I thought if I make a list of more common programming
mistakes it might be of help. They are not arranged in any
particular order. But as you would realize surely a great help!

Cine’ iier are great innovators of our times. Unhappily,

[1] Omitting the ampersand before the variables used in scanf().
For example,

int choice ;
scanf ("%d", choice ) ;

Here, the & before the variable choice is missing. Another
common mistake with scanf( ) is to give blanks either just
before the format string or immediately after the format string
as in,

int choice ;
scanf(" %d", choice ) ;

Note that this is not a mistake, but till you don't understand
scanf( ) thoroughly, this is going to cause trouble. Safety is in
eliminating the blanks. Thus, the correct form would be,

int choice ;
scanf ("%d", &choice ) ;
