Using the operator = instead of the operator = =.

What do you think will be the output of the following
program:

main()

{
int i= 10;
while (i= 10)
{

printf (“got to get out" ) ;
itt;
}
}

At first glance it appears the message will be printed once and
the control will come out of the loop since i becomes 11. But,
actually we have fallen in an indefinite loop. This is because
the = used in the condition always assigns the value 10 to i,
and since i is non-zero the condition is satisfied and the body
of the loop is executed over and over again.

Ending a loop with a semicolon.
Observe the following program.

main()
{
int j=1;

while (j <= 100) ;
{
printf ( "\nCompguara” ) ;
jets
}
}
