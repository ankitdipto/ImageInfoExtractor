Inadvertently, we have fallen in an indefinite loop. Cause is
the semicolon after while. This in effect makes the compiler
feel that you wanted the loop to work in the following
manner:

while (j <= 100);

This is an indefinite loop since j never gets incremented and
hence eternally remains less that 100.

Omitting the break statement at the end of a case in a switch
statement.

Remember that if a break is not included at the end of a case,
then execution will continue into the next case.

main()
int ch=1;

switch (ch)
{
case 1:
printf ( “\nGoodbye" ) ;
case 2:
printf ( "\nLieutenant” ) ;
}
}

Here, since the break has not been given after the printf() in
case 1, the control runs into case 2 and executes the second
printf() as well.

However, this sometimes turns out to be a blessing in
disguise. Especially, in cases when we are checking whether
the value of a variable equals a capital letter or a small case
