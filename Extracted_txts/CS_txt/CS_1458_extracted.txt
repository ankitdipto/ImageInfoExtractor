MINIMIZATION

Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

Like any other sort of object, events can be grouped into categories. For example,
WorldWarl/belongs to the category Wars. To say that a war occurred in the Middle East in
1967, we would say

3w wé Wars A SubEvent(w, AD 1967) A PartOf(Location(w)MiddleEast)

To say that Shankar travelled from New York to New Delhi yesterday, we might use the category
Journeys, as follows:
Sj j E Journeys A Origin(NewYork,j)A Destination(NewDelhi,})
A Traveller(Shankar,j)A SubEvent(j, Yesterday)

This notation can get a little tedious, particularly because we are often interested more in the
event's properties than in the event itself. We can simplify the descriptions by using complex terms
to name event categories. For example, Go(Shankar,New York, NewDelhi)names the category of
events in which Shankar travels from New York to New Delhi. The function symbol Go can be
defined by the following sentence:
Ve,x,0,d e€Golt,0,d) >
ee Journeys A Traveller(x.e) A Origin(o, e) A Destination(d, e)

Finally, we use the notation £(c, i) to say that an event of category c is a subevent of the event (or |
interval) i:

Voi Ec.i) + 3e eec A SubEvent(e, i)
Thus, we have
E(Go(Shankar, NewYork, NewDethi), Yesterday)

which means "there was an event that was a going by Shankar from New York to New Delhi that
took place sometime yesterday."

Places

Places, like intervals, are special kinds of space-time chunks. A place can be thought of as a
constant piece of space, extended through time.'” New York and the Middle East are places, at
least as far as recent history is concerned. We use the predicate Jn to denote the special kind of j
subevent relation that holds between places; for example:

In(New York, USA)
Places come in different varieties; for example, NewYork is an Area, whereas the SolarSystemis

a Volume. The Location function, which we used earlier, maps an object to the smallest place |
that contains it:

Vx,/ Location(x) =1 <>
At, D AW Iz AX) = In(l,b)

This last sentence is an example ofa standard logical construction called minimization.

10 We will not worry about local inertial coordinate frames and other things that physicists need to pin down exactly
what this means. Places that change over time are dealt with in a later section.
