letter. This example has been succinctly explained in Chapter
4.

Using continue in a switch.

It is a common error to believe that the way the keyword
break is used with loops and a switch; similarly the keyword
continue can also be used with them. Remember that
continue works only with loops, never with a switch.

A mismatch in the number, type and order of actual and formal
arguments.

yr = romanise ( year, 1000, 'mâ€™) ;

Here, three arguments in the order int, int and char are being
passed to romanise(). When romanise() receives these
arguments into formal arguments they must be received in the
same order. A careless mismatch might give strange results.

Omitting provisions for returning a non-integer value from a
function.

If we make the following function call,

area = area_circle (1.5) ;

then while defining area_circle( ) function later in the
program, care should be taken to make it capable of returning
a floating point value. Note that unless otherwise mentioned
the compiler would assume that this function returns a value

of the type int.

Inserting a semicolon at the end of a macro definition.
