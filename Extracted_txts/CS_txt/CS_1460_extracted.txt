How do you recognize a C programmer? Ask him to write a
paragraph in English and watch whether he ends each
sentence with a semicolon. This usually happens because a C
programmer becomes habitual to ending all statements with a
semicolon. However, a semicolon at the end of a macro
definition might create a problem. For example,

#define UPPER 25 ;
would lead to a syntax error if used in an expression such as
if (counter == UPPER )

This is because on preprocessing, the if statement would take
the form

if (counter == 25 )
Omitting parentheses around a macro expansion.

#define SQR(x) x* x
main()
{

int a;

a=25/SQR(5);
printf ( "\n%d", a) ;
}

In this example we expect the value of a to be 1, whereas it
turns out to be 25. This so happens because on preprocessing
the arithmetic statement takes the following form:

a=25/5"5;
