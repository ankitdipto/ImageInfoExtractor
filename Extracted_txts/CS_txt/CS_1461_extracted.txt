[10] Leaving a blank space between the macro template and the
macro expansion.

#define ABS (a) (a=0 ?a:-a)
Here, the space between ABS and (a) makes the preprocessor
believe that you want to expand ABS into (a), which is
certainly not what you want.
[11] Using an expression that has side effects in a macro call.
#define SUM (a) (a+a)
main()
{
int w, b= 5;
w= SUM(b++) ;
printf ("\n%d", w) ;
On preprocessing, the macro would be expanded to,
w= (b++)+(b++);
If you are wanting to first get sum of 5 and 5 and then

increment b to 6, that would not happen using the above
macro definition.

[12] Confusing a character constant and a character string.
In the statement
ch='2';

a single character is assigned to ch. In the statement
