a pointer to the character string “a” is assigned to ch.
Note that in the first case, the declaration of ch would be,
char ch;

whereas in the second case it would be,

char “ch;

[13] Forgetting the bounds of an array.
main()
{

int num[50}, i;

for (i= 1; 1 <= 50; i++)
num[i] i;

 

}

Here, in the array num there is no such element as num[50],
since array counting begins with 0 and not 1. Compiler would
not give a warning if our program exceeds the bounds. If not
taken care of, in extreme cases the above code might even
hang the computer.

[14] Forgetting to reserve an extra location in a character array for the
null terminator.

Remember each character array ends with a ‘\0’, therefore its
dimension should be declared big enough to hold the normal
characters as well as the ‘\0’.
