Appendix C: Chasing The Bugs 709

 

For example, the dimension of the array word[ ] should be 9
if a string “Jamboree” is to be stored in it.

[15] Confusing the precedences of the various operators.

main()

{
char ch;
FILE “fp;

fp = fopen (“text.c’, "r") ;

while (ch = getc ( fp ) != EOF )
putch (ch) ;

fclose (fp) ;
}

Here, the value retumed by gete( ) will be first compared with
EOF, since != has a higher priority than =. As a result, the
value that is assigned to ch will be the true/false result of the
test—1 if the value retumed by getc( ) is not equal to EOF,
and 0 otherwise. The correct form of the above while would
be,

while ( (ch = getc (fp) ) |= EOF )
putch (ch) ;

[16] Confusing the operator -> with the operator . while referring to a
structure element.

Remember, on the left of the operator . only a structure
variable can occur, whereas on the left of the operator -> only
a pointer to a structure can occur. Following example
demonstrates this.

main()
