[17] Forgetting to use the far keyword for referring memory locations
beyond the data segment.

main()
{
unsigned int “s ;

s = 0x413;

printf ( "\n%d", *s ) ;
}
Here, it is necessary to use the keyword far in the declaration
of variable s, since the address that we are storing in s (0x413)
is a address of location present in BIOS Data Area, which is

far away from the data segment. Thus, the correct declaration
would look like,

unsigned int far *s ;

The far pointers are 4-byte pointers and are specific to DOS.
Under Windows every pointer is 4-byte pointer.
