main()
{
char ch;

for (ch = 0; ch <= 255; ch++)
printf ( â€œ\n%c %d", ch, ch ) ;

Can you believe that this is an indefinite loop? Probably, a
closer look would confirm it. Reason is, ch has been declared
as a char and the valid range of char constant is -128 to
+127. Hence, the moment ch tries to become 128 (through
ch++), the value of character range is exceeded, therefore the
first number from the negative side of the range, -128, gets
assigned to ch. Naturally the condition is satisfied and the
control remains within the loop externally.
