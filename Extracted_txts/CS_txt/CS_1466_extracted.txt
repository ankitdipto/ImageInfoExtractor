8-1 Introduction

The part ofthe computer that performs the bulk of data-processing operations
is called the central processing unit and is referred to as the CPU. The CPU is
made up of three major parts, as shown in Fig. &1. The register set stores
intermediate data used during the execution of the instructions. The arithmetic
Jogic urut (ALU) performs the required microuperations for executing the
instructions The control unitsupervises the transferofinformation among the
registers and instucts the ALU as to which operation to pexform.

The CPU performs a variety of functions dictated by the type of in-
structions that are incorporated in the computer. Computer architecture is
sometimes defined as the computer structure and behavior as seen by the
programmer that uses machine language instructions. This includes the in-
struction formats, addressing modes, the instruction set, and the general
‘organization of the CPU registers.

One boundary where the computer designer and the computer pro-
grammer see the same machine is the part of the CPU associated with the
instruction set. From the des’ gner'spoint of view, the computer instruction set
provides the specifications for the design of the CPU. The design of a CPUis
