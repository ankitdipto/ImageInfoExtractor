OVERVIEW

 

An operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between the
user of a computer and the computer hardware. The purpose of an operating
system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a
convenient and efficient manner.

We trace the development of operating systems from the first hands-on sys-
tems, through multiprogrammed and time-shared systems, to current handheld
and real- time systems. Understanding the evolution of operating systems gives
us an appreciation for what an operating system does and how it does it.

The operating system must ensure the correct operation of the computer
system. To prevent user programs from interfering with the proper opera-
tion of the system, the hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms. We
describe the basic computer architecture that makes it possible to write a correct
operating system.

The operating system provides certain services to programs and to the users
of those programs in order to make their tasks easier. The services differ from
one operating system to another, but we identify and explore some common
classes of these services.
