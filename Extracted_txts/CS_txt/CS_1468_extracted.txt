INTRODUCTION

 

An operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware. It
also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
between a user of a computer and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect
of operating systems is how varied they are in accomplishing these tasks.
Mainframe operating systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization
of hardware. Personal computer (PC) operating systems support complex
games, business applications, and everything in between. Handheld computer
operating systems are designed to provide an environment in which a user can
easily interface with the computer to execute programs. Thus, some operating
systems are designed to be convenient, others to be efficient, and others some
combination of the two.

To understand what operating systems are, we must first understand how
they have developed. In this chapter, we trace the development of operating
systems from the first hands-on systems through multiprogrammed and time-
shared systems to PCs, and handheld computers. We also discuss operating
system variations, such as parallel, real-time, and embedded systems. As we
move through the various stages, we see how the components of operating
systems evolved as natural solutions to problems in early computer systems.

1.1 = What Is an Operating System?

An operating system is an important part of almost every computer system. A
computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the hardware,
the operating system, the application programs, and the users (Figure 1.1).
