Figure 1.1 Abstract view of the components of a computer system.

The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the
input/output (1/0) devices—provides the basic computing resources. The
application programs —such as word processors, spreadsheets, compilers, and
web browsers—define the ways in which these resources are used to solve
the computing problems of the users. The operating system controls and
coordinates the use of the hardware among the various application programs
for the various users.

The components of a computer system are its hardware, software, and data.
The operating system provides the means for the proper use of these resources
in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is similar to
a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It
simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful
work. Operating systems can be explored from two viewpoints: the user and
the system.

1.1.1 User View

The user view of the computer varies by the interface being used. Most
computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse,
and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user to monopolize
its resources, to maximize the work (or play) that the user is performing.
In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for ease of use, with
