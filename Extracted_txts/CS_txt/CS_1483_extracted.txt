ple, a metropolitan-area network (MAN), could link buildings within a city.
BlueTooth devices communicate over a short distance of several feet, in essence
creating a small-area network.

The media to carry networks are equally varied. They include copper wires,
fiber strands, and wireless transmissions between satellites, microwave dishes,
and radios. When computing devices are connected to cellular phones, they
create a network. Even very short-range infrared communication can be used
for networking. At a rudimentary level, whenever computers communicate
they use or create a network. These networks also vary by their performance
and reliability.

1.5.1 Client-Server Systems

As PCs have become faster, more powerful, and cheaper, designers have shifted
away from the centralized system architecture. Terminals connected to central-
ized systems are now being supplanted by PCs. Correspondingly, user-interface
functionality that used to be handled directly by the centralized systems is
increasingly being handled by the PCs. As a result, centralized systems today
act as server systems to satisfy requests generated by client systems. The
general structure of a client-server system is depicted in Figure 1.5.

Server systems can be broadly categorized as compute servers and file
servers.

« Compute-server systems provide an interface to which clients can send
requests to perform an action, in response to which they execute the action
and send back results to the client.

 File-server systems provide a file-system interface where clients can create,
update, read, and delete files.

1.5.2 Peer-to-Peer Systems

The growth of computer networks—especially the Internet and World Wide
Web (WWW)—has had a profound influence on the recent development of
operating systems. When PCs were introduced in the 1970s, they were designed
