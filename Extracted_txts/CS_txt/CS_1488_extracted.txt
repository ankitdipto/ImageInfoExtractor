20. Chapter1 Introduction

many PDAs currently do not provide wireless access. To download data to these
devices, typically one first downloads the data to a PC or workstation, and then
downloads the data to the PDA. Some PDAs allow data to be directly copied
from one device to another using an infrared link. Generally, the limitations
in the functionality of PDAs are balanced by their convenience and portability.
Their use continues to expand as network connections become more available
and other options, such as cameras and MP3 players, expand their utility.

1.9 m= Feature Migration

Overall, an examination of operating systems for mainframes and microcom-
puters shows that features once available only on mainframes have been
adopted by microcomputers. The same concepts are appropriate for the var-
ious classes of computers: mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers, and
handhelds. Many of the concepts depicted in Figure 1.6 will be covered later
in this book. However, to start understanding modern operating systems, you
need to realize the theme of feature migration and to recognize the long history
of many operating-system features.
