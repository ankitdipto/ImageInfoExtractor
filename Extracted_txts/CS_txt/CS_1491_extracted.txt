midnight (GMT) on January 1, 1900, has time 0. The functions Start and End pick out the earliest
and latest moments in an interval, and the function Time delivers the point on the time scale for
a moment. The function Duration gives the difference between the end time and the start time.

Vi Interval(i) = Duration(i)=(Time(End(i)) — Time(Start(i)))
Time(Start(AD1900)) =Seconds(0)

Time(Start(AD: 99 1 )) =Seconds(2871 694800)

Time(End(AD1 99 1 )) = Seconds(2903230800)

Duration(AD1 991) =Seconds(31 536000)

To make these numbers easier to read, we also introduce a function Date, which takes six
arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, month, day, and year) and returns a point on the time scale:

Time(Start(AD1991)) =SecondsDate(00, 00, 00, Jan,|, 1991)
Date(12, 34,56, Feb, 14, 1993)=2938682096

The simplest relation between intervals is Meet. Two intervals Meet if the end time of the
first equals the start time of the second. It is possible to define predicates such as Before, After,
During, and Overlap solely in terms of Meet, but it is more intuitive to define them in terms of
points on the time scale. (See Figure 8.5 for a graphical representation.)

Vij Meet(i,j) 4 Time(End(i)) = Time(Start(j))

Vij Before(i,j) <= Time(End(i))< ‘Time(Start(j))

Vij After(j,i) = Before(i.j)

Vij During(i.j) = Time(Start()< Time(Start(i))A Time(End(i)) <_ Time(End(j))
Vij Overlapli,j) 3k During(k, i) A During(k,j)
