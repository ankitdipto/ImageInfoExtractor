We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of
the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system
to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources? Why is such a system
not really wasteful?

Under what circumstances would a user be better off using a time-sharing
system, rather than a PC or single-user workstation?

Describe the differences between symmetric and asymmetric multipro-
cessing. What are three advantages and one disadvantage of multipro-
cessor systems?

What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing
an operating system for a real-time environment?

Consider the various definitions of operating system. Consider whether
the operating system should include applications such as web browsers
and mail programs. Argue both pro and con positions, and support your
answers.

What are the tradeoffs inherent in handheld computers?

Consider a computing cluster consisting of two nodes running a database.
Describe two ways in which the cluster software can manage access to the
data on the disk. Discuss the benefits and detriments of each.

Bibliographical Notes

Time-sharing systems were proposed first by Strachey [1959]. The earliest time-
sharing systems were the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) developed
at MIT (Corbato et al. [1962]) and the SDC Q-32 system, built by the System
Development Corporation (Schwartz et al. [1964], Schwartz and Weissman
[1967]). Other early, but more sophisticated, systems include the MULTIplexed
Information and Computing Services (MULTICS) system developed at MIT (Cor-
bato and Vyssotsky [1965]), the XDS-940 system developed at the University of
