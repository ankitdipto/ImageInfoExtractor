COMPUTER-
SYSTEM
STRUCTURES

 

 

We need to have a general knowledge of the structure of a computer system
before we can explore the details of system operation. In this chapter, we look
at several disparate parts of this structure to round out our background knowl-
edge. This chapter is mostly concerned with computer-system architecture, so
you can skim or skip it if you already understand the concepts. The first topics
covered here include system startup, I/O, and storage.

The operating system must also ensure the correct operation of the com-
puter system. To ensure that user programs will not interfere with the proper
operation of the system, the hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms
to ensure correct behavior. Later in this chapter, we describe the basic computer
architecture that makes it possible to write a functional operating system. We
conclude with a network architecture overview.

2.1 = Computer-System Operation

A modern, general-purpose computer system consists of a CPU and a number
of device controllers that are connected through a common bus that provides
access to shared memory (Figure 2.1). Each device controller is in charge
of a specific type of device (for example, disk drives, audio devices, and
video displays). The CPU and the device controllers can execute concurrently,
competing for memory cycles. To ensure orderly access to the shared memory,
amemory controller is provided whose function is to synchronize access to the
memory.
