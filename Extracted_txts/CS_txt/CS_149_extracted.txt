Figure 26.11 Grids for the escape problem. Starting points are black, and other grid vertices are
white, (a) A grid with an escape, shown by shaded paths. (b) A grid with no escape.

b. Describe an efficient algorithm to solve the escape problem, and analyze its
running time.

26-2 Minimum path cover

A path cover of a directed graph G = (V, E) is a set P of vertex-disjoint paths
such that every vertex in V is included in exactly one path in P. Paths may start
and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. A minimum path
cover of G is a path cover containing the fewest possible paths.

a. Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum path cover of a directed acyclic
graph G = (V,£). (Hint: Assuming that V = {1,2,..., n}, construct the
graph G’ = (V’, E’), where

VO = fXo% etn} U Yor Dien Pf +
El’ = {(x0.%1) 21 ©V}UL{Oi. Yo) 57 EV} U (OG. y/) (7) € E}

and run a maximum-flow algorithm.)

b. Does your algorithm work for directed graphs that contain cycles? Explain.

26-3 Algorithmic consulting

Professor Gore wants to open up an algorithmic consulting company. He has iden-
tified n important subareas of algorithms (roughly corresponding to different por-
tions of this textbook), which he represents by the set A = {Aj, Ap..... A,}. In
each subarea Ax, he can hire an expert in that area for cx dollars. The consulting
company has lined up a set J = {J1, J2,..., Jm} of potential jobs. In order to
perform job J;, the company needs to have hired experts in a subset Rj © A of
