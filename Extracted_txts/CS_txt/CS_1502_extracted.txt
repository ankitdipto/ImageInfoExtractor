For example, to say that the reign of Elizabeth II followed that of George VI, and the reign of
Elvis overlapped with the 1950s, we can write the following:

After(ReignOf (ElizabethI1), ReignOf(GeorgeV1))

Overlap( Fifties, ReignOf (Elvis))
Start(Fifties) =Start(AD1950)
Endifties) = End(AD 1959)

Temporal relations among intervals are used principally in describing actions. This is done j
in much the same way in event calculus as it is in situation calculus. The difference is that instead
of defining a resulting situation and describing it, one defines a resulting interval, in which a
certain state occurs. The following examples illustrate the general idea:

1. Iftwo people are engaged, then in some future interval, they will either marry or break the
engagement.
Vxyio T(Engaged(x.y), io) >
3%) (Meet(ini) V After(is.io)) A
T(Marry(x,y) V BreakEngagement(x, y),i))
2. When two people marry, they are spouses for some interval starting at the end of the
marrying event.
Vx,y,io T(Marry(x,y),in)=> Ji; T(Spouse(xy), il) A MeetCio, il)
3. The result of going from one place to another is to be at that other place.
Vx,a,b,i9 ,Fiy T(Golx,a,b),i9) > TUn(x,b). iA Meet(ig, i1)
We shall have more to say on the subject ofactions and intervals in PartIV, which covers planning
with these sorts of action descriptions.
Objects revisited
One purpose of situation calculus was to allow objects to have different properties at different
times. Event calculus achieves the same goal. For example, we can say that Poland's area in
1426 was 233,000 square miles, whereas in 1950itwas 117,000 square miles:
T(Area( Poland, SqMiles(233000)), AD1426)
T(Area(Poland,SqMiles(\ 17000)),AD 1950)
In fact, as well as growing and shrinking, Poland has moved about somewhat on the map. We-
could plot its land area over time, as shown in Figure 8.6. We see that Poland has a temporal
| bee as well as spatial extent. Jt tums out to be perfectly consistent to view Poland as an event.
= We can then use temporal subevents such as /9thCenturyPoland,and spatial subevents such as

CentralPoland.

The USA has also changed various aspects over time. One aspect that changes every four
or eight years, barring mishaps, is its president. In event calculus, President(USA) denotes an
object that consists of different people at different times. President(USA) is the object that is
George Washington from 1789 to 1796, John Adams from 1796 to 1800, and so on (Figure 8.7).
To say that the president of the USA in 1994 is a Democrat, we would use

T(Democrat(PresidentUSA)),AD 1994)
