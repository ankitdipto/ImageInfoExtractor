Figure 2.5 Moving-head disk mechanism.

When the disk is in use, a drive motor spins it at high speed. Most drives
rotate 60 to 200 times per second. Disk speed has two parts. The transfer
rate is the rate at which data flow between the drive and the computer. The
positioning time, sometimes called the random-access time, consists of the
time to move the disk arm to the desired cylinder, called the seek time, and
the time for the desired sector to rotate to the disk head, called the rotational
latency. Typical disks can transfer several megabytes of data per second, and
they have seek times and rotational latencies of several milliseconds.

Because the disk head flies on an extremely thin (measured in microns)
cushion of air, there is a danger of the head making contact with the disk
surface. Although the disk platters are coated with a thin protective layer,
sometimes the head will damage the magnetic surface. This accident is called a
head crash. A head crash normally cannot be repaired; the entire disk must be
replaced.

A disk can be removable, allowing different disks to be mounted as needed.
Removable magnetic disks generally consist of one platter, held in a plastic case
to prevent damage while not in the disk drive. Floppy disks are inexpensive
removable magnetic disks that have a soft plastic case containing a flexible
platter. The head of a floppy-disk drive generally sits directly on the disk
surface, so the drive is designed to rotate more slowly than a hard-disk drive
to reduce the wear on the disk surface. The storage capacity of a floppy disk is
typically only 1 MB or so. Removable disks are available that work much like
normal hard disks and have capacities measured in gigabytes.
