Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

subareas. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simultaneously. If the company
chooses to accept job J;, it must have hired experts in all subareas in R;, and it will
take in revenue of p; dollars.

Professor Gore’s job is to determine which subareas to hire experts in and which
jobs to accept in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from
jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the experts.

Consider the following flow network G. It contains a source vertex s, vertices
A, Ao,..., Ay, vertices Ji, Jo,..., Jm, and a sink vertex ¢. Fork = 1,2...,n,
the flow network contains an edge (s, Ax) with capacity c(s, Ag) = cx, and
fori = 1,2,..., m, the flow network contains an edge (J;.f) with capacity
c(Ji.t) = p;. Fork = 1,2,..., nandi = 1,2,..., m, if Ay € R;, then G
contains an edge (Ax, J;) with capacity c( Ag, Jj) = 00.

a. Show that if J; € T fora finite-capacity cut (S, 7) of G, then Ay € T for each
A, ER;.

b. Show how to determine the maximum net revenue from the capacity of a mini-
mum cut of G and the given p; values.

c. Give an efficient algorithm to determine which jobs to accept and which experts
to hire. Analyze the running time of your algorithm in terms of m, n, and

r= Di IR.

26-4 Updating maximum flow
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s, sink f, and integer capacities.
Suppose that we are given a maximum flow in G.

a. Suppose that we increase the capacity of a single edge (u,v) € E by 1. Give
an O(V + E)-time algorithm to update the maximum flow.

b. Suppose that we decrease the capacity of a single edge (u,v) € E by 1. Give
an O(V + E)-time algorithm to update the maximum flow.

26-5 Maximum flow by scaling
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s, sink f, and an integer capac-
ity c(u, v) on each edge (u,v) € E. Let C = maxqvez c(u,v).

a. Argue that a minimum cut of G has capacity at most C | E|.

b. For a given number K, show how to find an augmenting path of capacity at
least K in O(E) time, if such a path exists.
