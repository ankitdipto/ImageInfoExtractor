2.4 Storage Hierarchy 39

 

Figure 2.6 Storage-device hierarchy.

In addition to having differing speed and cost, the various storage systems
are either volatile or nonvolatile. Volatile storage loses its contents when
the power to the device is removed. In the absence of expensive battery
and generator backup systems, data must be written to nonvolatile storage
for safekeeping. In the hierarchy shown in Figure 2.6, the storage systems
above the electronic disk are volatile, whereas those below are nonvolatile. An
electronic disk can be designed to be either volatile or nonvolatile. During
normal operation, the electronic disk stores data in a large DRAM array, which is
volatile. But many electronic-disk devices contain a hidden magnetic hard disk
and a battery for backup power. If external power is interrupted, the electronic-
disk controller copies the data from RAM to the magnetic disk. When external
power is restored, the controller copies the data back into the RAM.

The design of a complete memory system must balance all these factors:
It uses only as much expensive memory as necessary, while providing as
much inexpensive, nonvolatile memory as possible. Caches can be installed to
improve performance where a large access-time or transfer-rate disparity exists
between two components.
