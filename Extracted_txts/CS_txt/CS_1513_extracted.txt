Figure 86 Viewing Poland as an object of varying size and location over time.

 

 

Objects such as Poland and President(USA) are called fluents. The dictionary says that a fluent
is something that is capable of flowing, like a liquid. For our purposes, a fluent is something that
flows or changes across situations.

It may seem odd to reify objects that are as transient as President( USA), yet fluents allow us
to say some things that would otherwise be cumbersome to express. For example, "The president
of the USA was male throughout the 19th century" can be expressed by

T(Male(President(USA)), 19thCentury)

even though there were 24 different presidents of the USA in the nineteenth century.

There are some things that can be easily expressed with fluents but not with situation
calculus. For example, Location(x) denotes the place in which x is located, even if that place
varies over time. We can then use sentences about the location of an object to express the fact
that, for example, the location of the Empire State Building is fixed:

Fixed(Location(EmpireStateBuilding))

Without fluents, we could find a way to talk about objects being widespread or immobile, but we
could not talk directly about the object's location over time. We leave it as an exercise to define
the Fixed predicate (Exercise 8.7).

Substances and objects

The real world perhaps can be seen as consisting of primitive objects (particles) and composite
objects built from them. By reasoning at the level of large objects such as apples and cars,
we can overcome the complexity involved in dealing with vast numbers of primitive objects
