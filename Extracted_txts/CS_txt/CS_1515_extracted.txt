binary code listed in the first column of the table specifies the binary code for
each of the three fields. The register selected by fields SELA, SELB, and SELD
is the one whose decimal number is equivalent to the binary number in the
code. When SELA or SELB is 000, the corresponding multiplexer selects the
external input data. When SELD = 000, no destination register is selected but
the contents of the output bus are available in the external output.

The ALU provides arithmetic and logic operations. In addition, the CPU
must provide shift operations. The shifter may be placed in the input of the
ALU to providea preshift capability, or at the output of the ALU to provide
postshifting capability. In some cases, the shift operations are included with
the ALU. An arithmetic logic and shift unit was designed in Sec 4-7. The
function table for this ALU is listed in Table 48. The encoding of the ALU
operations for the CPU is taken from Sec. 4-7 and is specified in Table 8-2 The
OPR field has five bits and each operation is designated witha symbolic name.
