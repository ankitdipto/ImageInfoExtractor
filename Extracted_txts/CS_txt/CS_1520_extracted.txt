executing in user mode to access monitor memory or other users’ memory
results in a trap to the monitor, which treats the attempt as a fatal error
(Figure 2.10). This scheme prevents the user program from (accidentally or
deliberately) modifying the code or data structures of either the operating
system or other users.

The base and limit registers can be loaded by only the operating system,
which uses a special privileged instruction. Since privileged instructions can be
executed in only monitor mode, and since only the operating system executes
in monitor mode, only the operating system can load the base and limit regis-
ters. This scheme allows the monitor to change the value of the registers, but
prevents user programs from changing the registers’ contents.

The operating system, executing in monitor mode, is given unrestricted
access to both monitor and users’ memory. This provision allows the operating
system to load users’ programs into users’ memory, to dump out those pro-
grams in case of errors, to access and modify parameters of system calls, and so
on.

2.5.4 CPU Protection

In addition to protecting I/O and memory, we must ensure that the operating
system maintains control. We must prevent a user program. from getting stuck
in an infinite loop or not calling system services, and never returning control
to the operating system. To accomplish this goal, we can use a timer. A timer
can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period. The period may be
