Figure 2.11 Local-area network.

The most common links in a local-area network are twisted pair and fiber
optic cabling. The most common configurations are multiaccess bus, ring,
and star networks. Communication speeds range from 1 megabit per second,
for networks such as AppleTalk, infrared, and the new Bluetooth local radio
network, to 1 gigabit per second for gigabit-Ethernet. Ten megabits per
second is most common, and is the speed of 10BaseT Ethernet. 100BaseT
Ethernet requires a higher-quality cable but runs at 100 megabits per second,
and is becoming common. Also growing is the use of optical-fiberâ€”based FDDI
networking. The FDDI network is token-based and runs at over 100 megabits
per second.

A typical LAN may consist of a number of different computers (from
mainframes to laptops or PDAs), various shared peripheral devices (such as
laser printers or magnetic-tape drives), and one or more gateways (specialized
processors) that provide access to other networks (Figure 2.11). An Ethernet
scheme is commonly used to construct LANs. An Ethernet network has no
central controller, because it is a multiaccess bus, so new hosts can be added
easily to the network.

2.6.2 Wide-Area Networks

Wide-area networks emerged in the late 1960s, mainly as an academic research
project to provide efficient communication among sites, allowing hardware and
software to be shared conveniently and economically by a wide community of
users. The first WAN to be designed and developed was the Arpanet. Begun
in 1968, the Arpanet has grown from a four-site experimental network to a
