50 Chapter2 Computer-System Structures

worldwide network of networks, the Internet, comprising millions of computer
systems.

Because the sites in a WAN are physically distributed over a large geograph-
ical area, the communication links are, by default, relatively slow and unreli-
able. Typical links are telephone lines, leased (dedicated data) lines, microwave
links, and satellite channels. These communication links are controlled by spe-
cial communication processors (Figure 2.12), which are responsible for defining
the interface through which the sites communicate over the network, as well as
for transferring information among the various sites.

For example, the Internet WAN provides the ability for hosts at geograph-
ically separated sites to communicate with one another. The host computers
typically differ from one another in type, speed, word length, operating sys-
tem, and so on. Hosts are generally on LANs, which are, in turn, connected
to the Internet via regional networks. The regional networks, such as NSFnet
in the northeast United States, are interlinked with routers (Section 15.4.2) to
form the worldwide network. Connections between networks frequently use
a telephone-system service called T1, which provides a transfer rate of 1.544
