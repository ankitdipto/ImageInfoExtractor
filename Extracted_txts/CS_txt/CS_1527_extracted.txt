Examples of Microoperations

A control word of 14 bitsis needed to specifya microoperation in the CPU. The
control word for a given microoperation can be derived from the selection
variables. For example, the subtract microoperation given by the statement

RICR2- RB

specifies R2 for the A input of the ALU, R3 for the B input of the ALU, R1 for
the destination register, and an ALU operation to subtract A — B. Thus the
control word is specified by the four fields and the corresponding binary value
for each field is obtained from the encoding listed in Tables 8-1 and 8-2 The
binary control word for the subtract microoperation is 010 O11 001 00101 and
is obtained as follows:

Field: SELA SELB SELD OPR
Symbol: R2 R3 RI SUB
Control word: 01001000101

The control word for this microoperation and a few others are listed in
Table 8-3.

Theincrement and transfer microoperations do not use the Binput of the
ALU. For these cases, the B field is marked witha dash. Weassign 000to any
unused field when formulating the binary control word, although any other
binary number may be used. To place the content of a register into the output
terminals we place the content of the register into the A input of the ALU, but
none of the registers are selected to accept the data. The ALU operation TSFA
places the data from the register, through the ALU, into the output terminals.
The direct transfer from input to output is accomplished with a control word
