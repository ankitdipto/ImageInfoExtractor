Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

Show that if M is a matching and P is an augmenting path with respect to M,
then the symmetric difference M @ P is a matching and |M @ P| =|M|+1.
Show that if P;, P2,.... Px are vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect
to M, then the symmetric difference M @ (P; U Pz U--++ U Px) is a matching
with cardinality |M| +k.

The general structure of our algorithm is the following:

Hopcrort-K ARP(G)

1
2
3

wu

M=96
repeat
let P = {P), Po,..., Px} be a maximal set of vertex-disjoint
shortest augmenting paths with respect to M
M = M @(P,U P2U---U Px)
until P == 9
return M

The remainder of this problem asks you to analyze the number of iterations in

the algorithm (that is, the number of iterations in the repeat loop) and to describe
an implementation of line 3.

b

Given two matchings M and M* in G, show that every vertex in the graph
G' = (V.M ® M*) has degree at most 2. Conclude that G’ is a disjoint
union of simple paths or cycles. Argue that edges in each such simple path
or cycle belong alternately to M or M*. Prove that if |M| < |M*|, then
M © M* contains at least |M*|— |M| vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with
respect to M.

Let / be the length of a shortest augmenting path with respect to a matching M, and
let P;, Po...., P; be a maximal set of vertex-disjoint augmenting paths of length /
with respect to M. Let M’ = M @(P, U---U Px), and suppose that P is a shortest
augmenting path with respect to M’.

c.

Show that if P is vertex-disjoint from P. P2..... P,, then P has more than /
edges.

Now suppose that P is not vertex-disjoint from P;, P2,.... P,. Let A be the
set of edges (M @ M’) @ P. Show that A = (P; U P) U---U Py) @ P and
that |A| > (k + 1)/. Conclude that P has more than / edges.

Prove that if a shortest augmenting path with respect to M has / edges, the size
of the maximum matching is at most |M| + |V|/( + D.
