Bibliographical Notes

Hennessy and Patterson [1996] provide coverage of I/O systems and buses, and
of system architecture in general. Tanenbaum [1990] describes the architecture
of microcomputers, starting at a detailed hardware level.

Discussions concerning magnetic-disk technology are presented by Freed-
man [1983] and by Harker et al. [1981]. Optical disks are covered by Kenville
[1982], Fujitani [1984], Oâ€™Leary and Kitts [1985], Gait [1988], and Olsen and Ken-
ley [1989]. Discussions of floppy disks are offered by Pechura and Schoeffler
[1983] and by Sarisky [1983].

Cache memories, including associative memory, are described and ana-
lyzed by Smith [1982]. That paper also includes an extensive bibliography on
the subject.

General discussions concerning mass-storage technology are offered by Chi
[1982] and by Hoagland [1985].

Tanenbaum [1996] and Halsall [1992] provide general overviews of com-
puter networks. Fortier [1989] presents a detailed discussion of networking
hardware and software.
