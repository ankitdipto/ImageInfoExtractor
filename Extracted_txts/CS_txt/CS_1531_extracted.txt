OPERATING-
SYSTEM
STRUCTURES

 

 

An operating system provides the environment within which programs are
executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, being
organized along many different lines. The design of a new operating system is
a major task. The goals of the system must be well defined before the design
begins. The type of system desired is the basis for choices among various
algorithms and strategies.

An operating system may be viewed from several vantage points. One is by
examining the services that it provides. Another is by looking at the interface
that it makes available to users and programmers. A third is by disassembling
the system into its components and their interconnections. In this chapter, we
explore all three aspects of operating systems, showing the viewpoints of users,
programmers, and operating-system designers. We consider what services
an operating system provides, how they are provided, and what the various
methodologies are for designing such systems.

3.1 = System Components

We can create a system as large and complex as an operating system only
by partitioning it into smaller pieces. Each piece should be a well-delineated
portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions.
Obviously, not all systems have the same structure. However, many mod-
ern systems share the goal of supporting the system components outlined in
Sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.8.
