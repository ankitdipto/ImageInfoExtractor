Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

assigned implicitly to each edge. This new algorithm takes a different approach and
assigns a length of 0 to high-capacity edges and a length of | to low-capacity edges.
Informally, with respect to these lengths, shortest paths from the source to the sink
tend have high capacity, which means that fewer iterations need be performed.

In practice, push-relabel algorithms currently dominate augmenting-path or
linear-programming based algorithms for the maximum-flow problem. A study
by Cherkassky and Goldberg [63] underscores the importance of using two heuris-
tics when implementing a push-relabel algorithm. The first heuristic is to peri-
odically perform a breadth-first search of the residual network in order to obtain
more accurate height values. The second heuristic is the gap heuristic, described in
Exercise 26.5-5. Cherkassky and Goldberg conclude that the best choice of push-
relabel variants is the one that chooses to discharge the overflowing vertex with the
maximum height.

The best algorithm to date for maximum bipartite matching, discovered by
Hopcroft and Karp [176], runs in O(/V E) time and is described in Problem 26-6.
The book by Lovasz and Plummer [239] is an excellent reference on matching
problems.
