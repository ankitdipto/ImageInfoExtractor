memory allows maximum speed and convenience of communication, as it can
be done at memory speeds when within a computer. Problems exist, however,
in the areas of protection and synchronization. The two communications
models are contrasted in Figure 3.5.

3.4 = System Programs

Another aspect of a modern system is the collection of system programs. Recall
Figure 1.1, which depicted the logical computer hierarchy. At the lowest
level is hardware. Next is the operating system, then the system programs,
and finally the application programs. System programs provide a convenient
environment for program development and execution. Some of them are
simply user interfaces to system calls; others are considerably more complex.
They can be divided into these categories:

File management: These programs create, delete, copy, rename, print,
dump, list, and generally manipulate files and directories.

Status information: Some programs simply ask the system for the date,
time, amount of available memory or disk space, number of users, or
similar status information. That information is then formatted, and is
printed to the terminal or other output device or file.
