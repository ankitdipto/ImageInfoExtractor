78  Chapter3 Operating-System Structures

These limitations have caused a small backlash against layering in recent
years. Fewer layers with more functionality are being designed, providing most
of the advantages of modularized code while avoiding the difficult problems
of layer definition and interaction. For instance, OS/2 is a descendant of MS-
DOS that adds multitasking and dual-mode operation, as well as other new
features. Because of this added complexity and the more powerful hardware
for which OS/2 was designed, the system was implemented in a more layered
fashion. Compare the MS-DOS structure (Figure 3.6) with that shown in Figure
3.9; from both the system-design and implementation standpoints, OS/2 has the
advantage. For instance, direct user access to low-level facilities is not allowed,
providing the operating system with more control over the hardware and more
knowledge of which resources each user program is using.

Asa further example, consider the history of Windows NT. The first release
had a highly layer-oriented organization; however, it delivered low perfor-
mance compared to that of Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 partially redressed
the performance problem by moving layers from user space to kernel space and
more closely integrating them.
