A major difficulty with the virtual-machine approach involves disk sys-
tems. Suppose that the physical machine has three disk drives but wants to
support seven virtual machines. Clearly, it cannot allocate a disk drive to each
virtual machine. Remember that the virtual-machine software itself will need
substantial disk space to provide virtual memory. The solution is to provide
virtual disks, which are identical in all respects except size—termed minidisks
in IBM's VM operating system. The system implements each minidisk by allo-
cating as many tracks on the physical disks as the minidisk needs. Obviously,
the sum of the sizes of all minidisks must be smaller than the size of the physical
disk space available.

Users thus are given their own virtual machines. They can then run any of
the operating systems or software packages that are available on the underlying
machine. For the IBM VM system, a user normally runs CMS—a single-user
interactive operating system. The virtual-machine software is concerned with
multiprogramming multiple virtual machines onto a physical machine, but
it does not need to consider any user-support software. This arrangement
may provide a useful partitioning into two smaller pieces of the problem of
designing a multiuser interactive system.

3.6.1 Implementation

Although the virtual-machine concept is useful, it is difficult to implement.
Much work is required to provide an exact duplicate of the underlying machine.
