Figure 1-23 Edge-triggered flip-flop.

The effective positive clock transition includes a minimum timecalled the setup
timein which the D input must remain at aconstant value before the transition,
and a definite timecalled the hold time in which the D input must not change
after the positive transition. The effective positive transition is usually a very
small fraction of the total period of the clock pulse.

Figure 1-2(b) shows the corresponding graphic symbol and timing dia-
gram for a negative-edge-triggered D flip-flop. The graphic symbol includes a
negation small circle in front of the dynamic indicator at the C input. This
denotes a negative-edge-triggered behavior. In this case the flip-flop responds
to a transition from the 1 level to the O level of the clock signal.

‘Another type of flip-flop used in some systems is the master-slave flip-
flop. This type of circuit consists of two flip-flops. The first is the master, which
responds to the positive level of the clock, and the second is the slave, which
responds to the negative level of the clock. The result is that the output changes
during the 1-to-0 transition of the clock signal. The trend is away from the use
of master-slave flip-flops and toward edge-triggered flip-flops.

Flip-flops available in integrated circuit packages will sometimes provide
special input terminals for setting or clearing the flip-flop asynchronously.
These inputs are usually called “preset” and “clear.” They affect the flip-flop
ona negative level of the input signal without the need of a clock pulse. These
inputs are useful for bringing the flip-flops to an initial state prior to its clocked
operation.
