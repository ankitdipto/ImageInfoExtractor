3.7 = System Design and Implementation

In this section, we discuss problems we face when designing and implementing
a system. No complete solutions to the design problems exist, but some
approaches have been successful.

3.7.1 Design Goals

The first problem in designing a system is to define the goals and specifications
of the system. At the highest level, the design of the system will be affected
by the choice of hardware and type of system: batch, time shared, single user,
multiuser, distributed, real time, or general purpose.

Beyond this highest design level, the requirements may be much harder to
specify. The requirements can be divided into two basic groups: user goals and
system goals.

Users desire certain obvious properties in a system: The system should be
convenient and easy to use, easy to learn, reliable, safe, and fast. Of course,
these specifications are not particularly useful in the system design, since there
is no general agreement on how to achieve these goals.

A similar set of requirements can be defined by those people who must
design, create, maintain, and operate the system: The operating system should
be easy to design, implement, and maintain; it should be flexible, reliable, error
free, and efficient. Again, these requirements are vague and have no general
solution.
