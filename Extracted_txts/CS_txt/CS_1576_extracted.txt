Exercises 91

What are the three major activities of an operating system in regard to
secondary-storage management?

What are the five major activities of an operating system in regard to file
management?

What is the purpose of the command interpreter? Why is it usually
separate from the kernel?

List five services provided by an operating system. Explain how each
provides convenience to the users. Explain in which cases it would be
impossible for user-level programs to provide these services.

What is the purpose of system calls?

Using system calls, write a program in either C or C++ that reads data
from one file and copies it to another file. Such a program was described
in Section 3.3.

Why does Java provide the ability to call from a Java program native
methods that are written in, say, C or C++? Provide an example where
a native method is useful.

What is the purpose of system programs?
What is the main advantage of the layered approach to system design?

What is the main advantage of the microkernel approach to system
design?

What is the main advantage for an operating-system designer of using a
virtual-machine architecture? What is the main advantage for a user?

Why is a just-in-time compiler useful for executing Java programs?
Why is the separation of mechanism and policy a desirable principle?

The experimental Synthesis operating system has an assembler incorpo-
rated within the kernel. To optimize system-call performance, the kernel
assembles routines within kernel space to minimize the path that the
system call must take through the kernel. This approach is the antithe-
sis of the layered approach, in which the path through the kernel is
extended so that building the operating system is made easier. Discuss the
pros and cons of the Synthesis approach to kernel design and to system-
performance optimization.
