Figure 6-4 Computer memory with progrom, dara, and sack segmencs,

SP points at the top of the stack. The three registers are eonnected toa common
address bus, and either one can provide an address for memory. PC is used
during the fetch phase to read an instruction. AR is used dusing the execute
phase to read an opetand. SP is used to push or popitems into or from the
stack.

As shown in Fig. 8-4, the initial value of SP is 4001 and the stack grows
with decreasing addcesses, Thus the firstitem stored inthe stack is at address
4000, the second item is stored at address 3999, and the last address that can
be used for the stack is 3000. No provisions are available for stack limit chechs.
