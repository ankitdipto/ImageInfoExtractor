92 Chapter3  Operating-System Structures

Bibliographical Notes

Dijkstra [1968] advocated the layered approach to operating-system design.
Brinch-Hansen [1970] was an early proponent of the construction of an
operating system as a kernel (or nucleus) on which can be built more
complete systems. Information of the QNX microkernel can be found at
http://www.qnx.com.

The first operating system to provide a virtual machine was the CP/67 on
an IBM 360/67. The commercially available IBM VM/370 operating system was
derived from CP/67. General discussions concerning virtual machines have
been presented by Hendricks and Hartmann [1979], by MacKinnon [1979], and
by Schultz [1988]. A virtual machine allowing Windows applications to run
on Linux is shown at http://www.vmware.com. Cheung and Loong [1995]
explored issues of operating-systems structuring from microkernel to extensible
systems. Back et al. [2000] discusses the design of Java operating systems.

MS-DOS, Version 3.1, is described in Microsoft [1986]. Windows NT is
described by Solomon [1998]. The Apple Macintosh operating system is
described in Apple [1987]. Berkeley UNIX (BSD) is described in McKusick et al.
[1996]. The standard AT&T UNIX system V is described in Earhart [1986]. A
good description of OS/2 is given by Iacobucci [1988]. Mach is introduced
by Accetta et al. [1986], and AIX is presented in Loucks and Sauer [1987].
The experimental Synthesis operating system is discussed by Massalin and Pu
[1989]. Linux kernel details are presented by Bar [2000].

The specification for the Java language and the Java virtual machine is pre-
sented by Gosling et al. [1996] and by Lindholm and Yellin [1998], respectively.
The internal workings of the Java virtual machine are described by Venners
[1998] and by Meyer and Downing [1997]. Jones and Lin [1996] provide a
thorough coverage of garbage-collection algorithms. More information on Java
is available on the Web at http://www javasoft.com.
