PROCESS
MANAGEMENT

 

A process can be thought of as a program in execution. A process will need cer-
tain resources—such as CPU time, memory, files, and I/O devices—to accom-
plish its task. These resources are allocated to the process either when it is
created or while it is executing.

A process is the unit of work in most systems. Such a system consists of a
collection of processes: Operating-system processes execute system code, and
user processes execute user code. All these processes may execute concurrently.

Although traditionally a process contained only a single thread of control
as it ran, most modern operating systems now support processes that have
multiple threads.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connec-
tion with process and thread management: the creation and deletion of both
user and system processes; the scheduling of processes; and the provision of
mechanisms for synchronization, communication, and deadlock handling for
processes.
