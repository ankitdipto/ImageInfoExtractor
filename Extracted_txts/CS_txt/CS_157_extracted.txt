SECTION 53 Computer Instructions — 133

instruction is a register-reference type. If the bit is 1, the instruction is an
input-output type. Note that the bit in position 15 of the instruction code is
designated by the symbol I but is not used as a mode bit when the operation
code is equal to 111.

Only three bits of the instruction are used for the operation code. It may
seem that the computer is restricted to a maximum of eight distinct operations.
However, since register-reference and input-output instructions use the remain-
ing 12 bits as part of the operation code, the total number of instructions can
exceed eight. In fact, the total number of instructions chosen for the basic
‘compoter is equal to 25.

The instructions for the computer are listed in Table 5-2. The symbol
designation is a three-letter word and represents an abbreviation intended for
