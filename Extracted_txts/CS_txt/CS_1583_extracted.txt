These state names are arbitrary, and they vary across operating systems.
The states that they represent are found on all systems, however. Certain
operating systems more finely delineate process states. Only one process can
be running on any processor at any instant, although many processes may be
ready and waiting. The state diagram corresponding to these states is presented
in Figure 4.1.

4.1.3 Process Control Block

Each process is represented in the operating system by a process control block
(PCB)—also called a task control block. A PCB is shown in Figure 4.2. It contains
many pieces of information associated with a specific process, including these:

 

state
process number
program counter

pointer Pe

_ registers

 

memory limits
list of open files
