Chapter4 Processes

Process state: The state may be new, ready, running, waiting, halted, and
so on.

Program counter: The counter indicates the address of the next instruction
to be executed for this process.

CPU registers: The registers vary in number and type, depending on the
computer architecture. They include accumulators, index registers, stack
pointers, and general-purpose registers, plus any condition-code informa-
tion. Along with the program counter, this state information must be saved
when an interrupt occurs, to allow the process to be continued correctly
afterward (Figure 4.3).

CPU-scheduling information: This information includes a process prior-
ity, pointers to scheduling queues, and any other scheduling parameters.
(Chapter 6 describes process scheduling.)

Memory-management information: This information may include such
information as the value of the base and limit registers, the page tables,
or the segment tables, depending on the memory system used by the
operating system (Chapter 9).
