may be busy with the I/O request of some other process. The process therefore
may have to wait for the disk. The list of processes waiting for a particular
1/O device is called a device queue. Each device has its own device queue
(Figure 4.4).

A common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram,
such as that in Figure 4.5. Each rectangular box represents a queue. Two types
of queues are present: the ready queue and a set of device queues. The circles
represent the resources that serve the queues, and the arrows indicate the flow
of processes in the system.

Anew process is initially put in the ready queue. It waits in the ready queue
until it is selected for execution (or dispatched). Once the process is assigned to
the CPU and is executing, one of several events could occur:

« The process could issue an I/O request, and then be placed in an 1/O queue.
The process could create a new subprocess and wait for its termination.

© The process could be removed forcibly from the CPU, as a result of an
interrupt, and be put back in the ready queue.
