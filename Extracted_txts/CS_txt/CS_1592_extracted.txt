4.3.1 Process Creation

A process may create several new processes, via a create~process system
call, during the course of execution. The creating process is called a parent
process, whereas the new processes are called the children of that process. Each
of these new processes may in turn create other processes, forming a free of
processes (Figure 4.7).

In general, a process will need certain resources (such as CPU time, memory,
files, I/O devices) to accomplish its task. When a process creates a subprocess,
that subprocess may be able to obtain its resources directly from the operating
system, or it may be constrained to a subset of the resources of the parent
process. The parent may have to partition its resources among its children,
or it may be able to share some resources (such as memory or files) among
several of its children. Restricting a child process to a subset of the parentâ€™s
resources prevents any process from overloading the system by creating too
many subprocesses.

When a process is created it obtains, in addition to the various physical and
logical resources, initialization data (or input) that may be passed along from
the parent process to the child process. For example, consider a process whose
function is to display the status of a file, say F;, on the screen of a terminal.
When itis created, it will get, as an input from its parent process, the name of the
file F,, and it will execute using that datum to obtain the desired information.
