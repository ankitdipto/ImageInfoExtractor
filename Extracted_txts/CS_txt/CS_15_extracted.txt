Figure 24.4 The execution of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The source is vertex s. The d val-
ues appear within the vertices, and shaded edges indicate predecessor values: if edge (u,v) is
shaded, then v.27 = w. In this particular example, each pass relaxes the edges in the order
(6.2). (6, 9) (E2). (0), 0.2), 2)s (ZX), (2.5), (8,0), (8, ). (a) The situation just before the
first pass over the edges. (b)-(e) The situation after each successive pass over the edges. The d
and 7 values in part (e) are the final values. The Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE in this
example,

Lemma 24.2

Let G = (V,E) be a weighted, directed graph with source s and weight func-
tion w : E — R, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles that are
reachable from s. Then, after the |V| — 1 iterations of the for loop of lines 2-4
of BELLMAN-ForD, we have v.d = 8(s,v) for all vertices v that are reachable
from s.

Proof We prove the lemma by appealing to the path-relaxation property. Con-
sider any vertex v that is reachable from s, and let p = (vo. V1. .... ve), Where
vo = 8 and vg = V, be any shortest path from s to v. Because shortest paths are
simple, p has at most |V|—1 edges, and sok < |V|—1. Each of the |V|— 1 itera-
tions of the for loop of lines 2-4 relaxes all |E | edges. Among the edges relaxed in
the ith iteration, fori = 1,2,.... k, is (vj-1, v;). By the path-relaxation property,
therefore, v.d = vg.d = 8(s, v¢) = S(s, v). .
