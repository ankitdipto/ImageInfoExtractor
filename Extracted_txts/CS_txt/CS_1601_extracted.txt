are written in infix notation, with each operator written between the operands.
Consider the simple arithmetic expression

A*B+C*D

The star (denoting multiplication) is placed between two operands A and B or
Cand D. The plus is between the two products. To evaluate this arithmetic
expression it is necessary to compute the product A +*B, store this product
while computing * D, and then sum the two products. From this example we
see that to evaluate arithmetic expressions in infix notation it is necessary to
scan back and forth along the expression to determine the next operation to
be performed.

The Polish mathematician Lukasiewicz showed that arithmetic expres-
sions can be represented in prefix notation. This representation, often referred
to as Polish notation, places the operator before the operands. The postfix
notation, referred to as reverse Polish notation (RPN), places the operator after the
operands. The following examples demonstrate the three representations:

A+B __Infix notation
+AB Prefix or Polish notation
AB+ Postfix or reverse Polish notation
The reverse Polish notation is in a form suitable for stack manipulation. The
expression
A*B+C*D
is written in reverse Polish notation as

AB*CD*+

and is evaluated as follows: Scan the expression from left to right. When an
operator is reached, perform the operation with the two operands found on
the left side of the operator. Remove the two operands and the operator and
replace them by the number obtained from the result of the operation. Con-
tinue to scan the expression and repeat the procedure for every operator
encountered until there are no more operators.

For the expression above we find the operator * after A and B. We
perform the operation A * Band replace A, B, and + by the product to obtain

(A*B)CD++

where (A * B) is a single quantity obtained from the product. The next operator
