120 Chapter4 Processes

A client communicates with the server by creating a socket and connecting
to the port the server is listening on. We implement such a client in the Java
program shown in Figure 4.11. The client creates a Socket and requests a
connection with the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 on port 5155. Once the
connection is made, the client can read from the socket using normal stream I/O
statements. After it has received the time of day from the server, the client closes
the socket and exits. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address known as the
local host. When a computer refers to IP address 127.0.0.1, it is referring to itself.
This mechanism allows the client and server on the same host to communicate
using the TCP/IP protocol. The IP address 127.0.0.1 could be replaced with the
TP address of another host running the time-of-day server.
