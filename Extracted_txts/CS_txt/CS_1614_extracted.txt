conversion to RPN

SECTION 83 Stack Organization 253

isa * and its previous two operands are C and D, so we perform C *D and
obtain an expression with two operands and one operator:

(A*B)(C*D) +

‘The next operator is + and the two operands to be added are the two products,
so we add the two quantities to obtain the result.

The conversion from infix notation to reverse Polish notation must take
into consideration the operational hierarchy adopted for infix notation. This
hierarchy dictates that we first perform all arithmeticinside inner parentheses,
then inside outer parentheses, and do multiplication and division operations
before addition and subtraction operations. Consider the expression

 

(A+ B)*[C#(D +E) + F]

To evaluate the expression we must first perform the arithmetic inside the
parentheses (A + B) and (D + E). Next we must calculate the expression
inside the square brackets. The multiplication of C*(D + E) must be done
prior to the addition of F since multiplication has precedence over addition. The
last operation is the multiplication of the two terms between the parentheses
and brackets. The expression can be converted to reverse Polish notation,
without the use of parentheses, by taking into consideration the operation
hierarchy. The converted expression is

 

AB+DE+C*F+*

Proceeding from left to right, we first add A and B, then add Dand E. At this
point we are left with

(A+ BY(D+E)C#F+ «

where (A + B) and (D + E) are each a single number obtained from the sum.
The two operands for the next * are C and (D+E), These two numbers are
multiplied and the product added to F. The final * causes the multiplication
of the two terms.

 

Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions

Reverse Polish notation, combined witha stack arrangement ofregisters, is the
most efficient way known for evaluating arithmetic expressions. This proce-
dure is employed in some electronic calculators and also in some computers.
‘The stack is particularly useful for handling long, complex problemsinvolving,
chain calculations. It is based on the fact that any arithmetic expression can be
expressed in parentheses-free Polish notation.
