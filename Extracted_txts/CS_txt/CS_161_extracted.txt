the problem size increases. Then, there are some problems for which we can invest
increasing amounts of computation time in return for increasingly better approx-
imate solutions. This chapter illustrates these possibilities with the vertex-cover
problem (unweighted and weighted versions), an optimization version of 3-CNF
satisfiability, the traveling-salesman problem, the set-covering problem, and the
subset-sum problem.
