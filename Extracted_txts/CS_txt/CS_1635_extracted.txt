Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

 

The next step is to describe meals and dishes in terms of their parts:

RequiredParts({MainCourses }, Meals)

OptionaiParts({ FirstCourses, SideDishes, Salads, Dessert.

RequiredParts({ Lettuce, Dressing}, GreenSalads)

Optional Parts({ Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Peppers, Carrots, ...}, GreenSalads)

RequiredParts({ Pasta, BologneseSauce}. PastaBolognese, )

OptionaParts( { GratedCheese}, PastaBolognese)

RequiredParts({ Onions, OliveOil, Butter, Celery, Carrots, GroundBeef Salt,
White Wines, Milk, TomatoStuff} BologneseSauce)

Then we need taxonomic information for dishes and foods:

GreenSalads C Salads

Salads C Dishes

PastaBolognese C FirstCourses

FirstCourses C Dishes

Tomatoes C TomatoStuff

CannedTomatoes C TomatoStuff

Tagliatelle C Pasta

Now we want to be able to determine what dishes can be made from the shopping list "tomatoes,
yellow onions, celery, a carrot, ground beef, milk, white wine, tagliatelle.” As mentioned earlier,
this is complicated by the fact that the salt, butter, and olive oil that are required for the Bolognese
dish are not on the shopping list. We define the predicate CanMake to hold between a shopping
list and a dish if the categories on the list, when combined with typical staples, cover all the
required parts of the dish. ae

V/, d CanMake(1,d) = d € Dishes A Required Part s(p, d) A p C Union(1, Staples)
{Salt,Butter, OliveOil} C Staples

With what we have so far, this would allow us to infer that Pasta Bolognese is the only dish 4
that can be made from the shopping list. The next question is what to do if fresh tomatoes are
not available. It turns out that all we have to do is replace the shopping list (or the part of the
shopping list that makes up this dish) with the list of part categories for this dish. In this case, that
means that Tomatoes would be replaced by TomatoStuffwhich could be satisfied by gathering
an instance of CannedTomatoes.

Navigating

An agent that wants to find a book in a library could traverse the entire library, looking at each
book until the desired one is found. But it would be more efficient to find the call number for the
book, find a map describing where that number can be found, and go directly there. It is the same
way with a supermarket, although the catalog system is not as good. A shopping agent should
know that supermarkets are arranged into aisles, that aisles have signs describing their contents 4
(in rough terms), and that objects that are near each other in the taxonomic hierarchy are likely to
be near each other in physical space. For example, British immigrants to the United States leam
that to find a package of tea, they should look for the aisle marked "Coffee."
