Figure 5.8 Java program for the summation of a non-negative integer.

When the summation program runs, two threads are created by the JVM.
The first is the thread associated with the application—the thread that starts
execution at the main method. The second thread is the Summation thread that
is created explicitly with the start method. The Summation thread begins
execution in its run method. The thread terminates when it exits from its run
method.
