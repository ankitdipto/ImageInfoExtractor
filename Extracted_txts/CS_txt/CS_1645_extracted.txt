Bibliographical Notes 149

recent developments in threading the Solaris 2 kernel. Zabatta and Young
[1998] compare Windows NT and Solaris 2 threads on a symmetric multipro-
cessor.

Information on multithreaded programming is given in Lewis and Berg
[1988], Sun [1995], and Kleiman et al. [1996], although these references tend
to be biased toward Pthreads. Oaks and Wong [1999], Lea [2000], and Hart-
ley [1998] discuss multithreading in Java. Solomon [1998] and Solomon and
Russinovich [2000] describe how threads are implemented in Windows NT
and Windows 2000, respectively. Beveridge and Wiener [1997] discuss mul-
tithreading using Win32, and Pham and Garg [1996] describe multithreading
programming using Windows NT.
