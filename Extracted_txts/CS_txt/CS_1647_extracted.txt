CPU
SCHEDULING

 

 

CPU scheduling is the basis of multiprogrammed operating systems. By switch-
ing the CPU among processes, the operating system can make the computer
more productive. In this chapter, we introduce the basic scheduling concepts
and present several different CPU-scheduling algorithms. We also consider the
problem of selecting an algorithm for a particular system.

6.1 = Basic Concepts

The objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all
times, in order to maximize CPU utilization. In a uniprocessor system, only
one process may run at a time; any other processes must wait until the CPU is
free and can be rescheduled.

The idea of multiprogramming is relatively simple. A process is executed
until it must wait, typically for the completion of some I/O request. In a
simple computer system, the CPU would then sit idle; all this waiting time is
wasted. With multiprogramming, we try to use this time productively. Several
processes are kept in memory at one time. When one process has to wait, the
operating system takes the CPU away from that process and gives the CPU to
another process. This pattern continues.

Scheduling is a fundamental operating-system function. Almost all com-
puter resources are scheduled before use. The CPU is, of course, one of the pri-
mary computer resources. Thus, its scheduling is central to operating-system
design.
