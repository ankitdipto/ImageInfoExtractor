152 Chapter6 CPU Scheduling

6.1.1 CPU-I/O Burst Cycle

The success of CPU scheduling depends on the following observed property
of processes: Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O
wait. Processes alternate between these two states. Process execution begins
with a CPU burst. That is followed by an I/O burst, then another CPU burst,
then another I/O burst, and so on. Eventually, the last CPU burst will end with
a system request to terminate execution, rather than with another I/O burst
(Figure 6.1).

The durations of these CPU bursts have been extensively measured.
Although they vary greatly by process and by computer, they tend to have a
frequency curve similar to that shown in Figure 6.2. The curve is generally
characterized as exponential or hyperexponential, with many short CPU bursts,
and a few long CPU bursts. An 1/O-bound program would typically have many
very short CPU bursts. A CPU-bound program might have a few very long
