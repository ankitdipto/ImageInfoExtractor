algorithm.

6.1.2 CPU Scheduler

Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the
processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried
out by the short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler). The scheduler selects from
among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU
to one of them.

The ready queue is not necessarily a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue. As we
shall see when we consider the various scheduling algorithms, a ready queue
may be implemented as a FIFO queue, a priority queue, a tree, or simply an
unordered linked list. Conceptually, however, all the processes in the ready
queue are lined up waiting for a chance to run on the CPU. The records in the
queues are generally process control blocks (PCBs) of the processes.

6.1.3 Preemptive Scheduling

CPU scheduling decisions may take place under the following four circum-
stances:
