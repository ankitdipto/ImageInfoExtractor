Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

 

DOMAIN CLOSURE

To implement this, we start with a set of causal rules for percepts:

Vx x G Tomatoes = SurfaceColor(xRed)

Vxx€ Oranges = SurfaceColor(x,Orange)

Vx x€Apples = SurfaceColor(xRed) V SurfaceColor(x,Green)
Vx x€ Tomatoes = Shape(x,Round)

Yx x G Oranges = Shape(x, Round)

Vx SurfaceColor(xe) A Visible(x) => CausesColorPercept(x,c)
Wx Shape(x, s) A Visible(x) => CausesShapePercept(x, s)

These rules, and many more like them, give a flavor ofa causal theory ofhow percepts are formed
by objects in the world. Notice how simplistic it is. For example, it does not mention lighting at
all. (Fortunately, the lights are always on in our supermarket.) From these rules, the agent will |
be able to deduce a set ofpossible objects that might explain its percepts. Knowledge about what
sorts of objects appear where will usually eliminate all but one category. Of course, the fact that
the agent only knows about one sort of object that might produce a given percept does not mean
that the percept must be produced by that sort of object. Logically, there might be other sorts of
objects (e.g., plastic tomatoes) that produce the same percept as the known category. This can
be handled either by a domain closure axiom, stating that the known categories are all the ones
there are, or by a default assumption, as described in Chapter 15.

The other part ofthe gathering problem is manipulation: being able to pick up objects and 4
carry them. In our simulation, we just assume a primitive action to grasp an object, and that the
agent can carry all the items it will need. In the real world, the actions required to pick up a
bunch of bananas without bruising them and a gallonjug of milk without dropping it pose serious |
problems. Chapter 25 considers them in more detail.

Communicating

The successful shopper knows when to ask questions (Where are the anchovies? Are these
tomatillas?). Unfortunately, being able to carry on a conversation is a difficult task, so we
will delay covering it until Chapter 22. Instead, we will cover a simpler form of one-way
communication: reading signs. If a word appears on an aisle's sign, then members of the
category that the word refers to will be located in that aisle

Va (a€Aisles\ 3s,w SignOf(sa) Aw G Words(s))>
dx,c Referent(wc) Ax Ge A A(x, a)

Ifa word appears on a small sign, then items of that category will be located nearby.

Vs,w,1 (sG Signs A Size(s) < Meters(3) A w G Words(s\A At(s, )) =>
3x, ¢ Referent(wc) Ax G c A At(x, AreaAround(I))
