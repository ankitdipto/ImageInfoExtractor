6.3 Scheduling Algorithms 165

In software, however, we need also to consider the effect of context switch-
ing on the performance of RR scheduling. Let us assume that we have only one
process of 10 time units. If the quantum is 12 time units, the process finishes
in less than 1 time quantum, with no overhead. If the quantum is 6 time units,
however, the process requires 2 quanta, resulting in 1 context switch. If the
time quantum is 1 time unit, then 9 context switches will occur, slowing the
execution of the process accordingly (Figure 6.4).

Thus, we want the time quantum to be large with respect to the context-
switch time. If the context-switch time is approximately 10 percent of the time
quantum, then about 10 percent of the CPU time will be spent in context switch.

Turnaround time also depends on the size of the time quantum. As we
can see from Figure 6.5, the average turnaround time of a set of processes does
not necessarily improve as the time-quantum size increases. In general, the
average turnaround time can be improved if most processes finish their next
CPU burst in a single time quantum. For example, given three processes of 10
time units each and a quantum of 1 time unit, the average turnaround time is
29. If the time quantum is 10, however, the average turnaround time drops to
20. If context-switch time is added in, the average turnaround time increases
for a smaller time quantum, since more context switches will be required.
