166 Chapter6 CPU Scheduling

On the other hand, if the time quantum is too large, RR scheduling degener-
ates to FCFS policy. A rule of thumb is that 80 percent of the CPU bursts should
be shorter than the time quantum.

6.3.5 Multilevel Queue Scheduling

Another class of scheduling algorithms has been created for situations in which
processes are easily classified into different groups. For example, a common
division is made between foreground (or interactive) processes and back-
ground (or batch) processes. These two types of processes have different
response-time requirements, and so might have different scheduling needs. In
addition, foreground processes may have priority (or externally defined) over
background processes.

A multilevel queue-scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue into
several separate queues (Figure 6.6). The processes are permanently assigned
to one queue, generally based on some property of the process, such as memory
size, process priority, or process type. Each queue has its own scheduling
algorithm. For example, separate queues might be used for foreground and
background processes. The foreground queue might be scheduled by an RR
algorithm, while the background queue is scheduled by an FCFS algorithm.

In addition, there must be scheduling among the queues, which is com-
monly implemented as fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. For example, the
foreground queue may have absolute priority over the background queue.
