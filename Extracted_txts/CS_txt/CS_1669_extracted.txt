Paying

The shopping agent also has to know enough so that it will not overpay for an item. First, it needs
to know typical fair prices for items, for example:

Vg g€Typical(GroundBeef) Weight(g) = Pounds(1) = $(1) < FairPrice(g) < $(2)

The agent should know that total price is roughly proportional to quantity, but that often discounts
are given for buying larger sizes. The following rule says that this discount can be up to 50%:

Vq.c.w.p qGcA Weight(q)—w A Price(q)=p >
Vm, q@ m>1Aqeéca Weight(q7y=m x w =>
(1+ 45+) xp < FairPrice(qz) < m x p
Most importantly, the agent should know that it is a bad deal to pay more than the fair price for
an item, and that buying anything that is a bad deal is a bad action:

Vi Price(i) > FairPrice(iy > BadDeal(i)

Vi BadDeal(i) = Va Bad(Buy(a,i))
Buying events belong to the category Buy(b, x, s,p)—buyerb buying object x from seller s for
price p. The complete description of buying is quite complex, but follows the general pattern
laid down earlier in the chapter for marriage. The preconditions include the fact that p is the
price of the object x, that b has at least that much money in the form of one or more monetary
instruments; and that s owns x. The event includes a monetary exchange that results in a net gain
ofp fors, and finally b owns x. Exercise 8.10 asks you to complete this description.

One final thing an agent needs to know about shopping: it is bad form to exit a shop while
carrying something that the shop owns.

Va,x,s, i s€ Shops A T(Carrying(ax) A At(x, s) A Owns(s,x)) >
T(Bad(Exit(a)),)

An agent with the goal of exiting will use this goal to set up the subgoal of owning all the objects
it is carrying. So all we need now is a description of the parts ofa buying event, so that the agent
can execute the buying. In a supemnarket, a buying event consists of going to a checkout stand,
placing all the items on the stand, waiting for the cashier to ring them up, placing a sum ofmoney
equal to the total price on the stand, and picking up the items again. Note that ifthe total is $4, it
will not do to place the same dollar bill onto the checkout stand four times.

Now we have touched on all the major areas of knowledge necessary for an agent to cope
with the grocery shopping world. A complete specification would make this chapter too long,
but we have outlined the approach one would take to complete this specification. Although it is
hard work, building actual knowledge bases of this kind is an invaluable experience.
