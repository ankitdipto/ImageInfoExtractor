6.6 = Algorithm Evaluation

How do we select a CPU-scheduling algorithm for a particular system? As we
saw in Section 6.3, there are many scheduling algorithms, each with its own
parameters. As a result, selecting an algorithm can be difficult.

The first problem is defining the criteria to be used in selecting an algo-
rithm. As we saw in Section 6.2, criteria are often defined in terms of CPU
utilization, response time, or throughput. To select an algorithm, we must
first define the relative importance of these measures. Our criteria may include
several measures, such as:

Maximize CPU utilization under the constraint that the maximum response
time is 1 second.

¢ Maximize throughput such that turnaround time is (on average) linearly
proportional to total execution time.

Once the selection criteria have been defined, we want to evaluate the
various algorithms under consideration. We describe the different evaluation
methods in Sections 6.6.1 through 6.6.4.
