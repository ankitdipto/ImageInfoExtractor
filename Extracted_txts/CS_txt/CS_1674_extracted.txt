6.6 Algorithm Evaluation 173

6.6.1 Deterministic Modeling

One major class of evaluation methods is called analytic evaluation. Analytic
evaluation uses the given algorithm and the system workload to produce a
formula or number that evaluates the performance of the algorithm for that
workload.

One type of analytic evaluation is deterministic modeling. This method
takes a particular predetermined workload and defines the performance of each
algorithm for that workload.

For example, assume that we have the workload shown. All five processes
arrive at time 0, in the order given, with the length of the CPU-burst time given
in milliseconds:

Process Burst Time

Py 10
P2 29
P3 3
Ps 7
Ps 12

Consider the FCFS, SJF, and RR (quantum = 10 milliseconds) scheduling algo-
rithms for this set of processes. Which algorithm would give the minimum
average waiting time?

For the FCFS algorithm, we would execute the processes as

 

 

Py | Po P3| Pa Ps
0 10 39 Â«42 49 61

 

 

 

 

 

The waiting time is 0 milliseconds for process P;, 10 milliseconds for process
P), 39 milliseconds for process P3, 42 milliseconds for process Py, and 49
milliseconds for process Ps. Thus, the average waiting time is (0 + 10 + 39 +
42 + 49)/5 = 28 milliseconds.

With nonpreemptive SJF scheduling, we execute the processes as

 

[2 P4 | Py | Ps | Po
0 3 10 20 32 61

 

 

 

The waiting time is 10 milliseconds for process P,, 32 milliseconds for process
P2, 0 milliseconds for process P3, 3 milliseconds for process P4, and 20 millisec-
onds for process P;. Thus, the average waiting time is (10 + 32 + 0 +3 + 20)/5=
13 milliseconds.
