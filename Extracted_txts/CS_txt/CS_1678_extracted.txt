Figure 6.9 Evaluation of CPU schedulers by simulation.

A distribution-driven simulation may be inaccurate, however, due to rela-
tionships between successive events in the real system. The frequency distribu-
tion indicates only how many of each event occur; it does not indicate anything
about the order of their occurrence. To correct this problem, we can use trace
tapes. We create a trace tape by monitoring the real system, recording the
sequence of actual events (Figure 6.9). This sequence is then used to drive the
simulation. Trace tapes provide an excellent way to compare two algorithms on
exactly the same set of real inputs. This method can produce accurate results
for its inputs.

Simulations can be expensive, however, often requiring hours of computer
time. A more detailed simulation provides more accurate results, but also
requires more computer time. In addition, trace tapes can require large amounts
of storage space. Finally, the design, coding, and debugging of the simulator
can be a major task.

6.6.4 Implementation

Even a simulation is of limited accuracy. The only completely accurate way to
evaluate a scheduling algorithm is to code it, put it in the operating system, and
see how it works. This approach puts the actual algorithm in the real system
for evaluation under real operating conditions.
