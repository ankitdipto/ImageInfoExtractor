Figure 6.10 Solaris 2 scheduling.

Each scheduling class includes a set of priorities. However, the scheduler
converts the class-specific priorities into global priorities, and selects to run the
thread with the highest global priority. The selected thread runs on the CPU

until one of the following occurs:

1. It blocks

2. It uses its time slice (if it is not a system thread)

3. Itis preempted by a higher-priority thread

If multiple threads have the same priority, the scheduler uses a round-robin

queue.
