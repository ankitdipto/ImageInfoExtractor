The priority of each thread is based upon the priority class it belongs to and the
relative priority within the class. This relationship is shown in Figure 6.11. The
values of each priority class appear in the top row. The left column contains the
values for the different relative priorities. For example, if the relative priority
of a thread in the ABOVE.NORMAL.PRIORITY-CLASS is NORMAL, the numeric
priority of that thread is 10.

Furthermore, each thread has a base priority representing a value in the
priority range for the class the thread belongs to. By default, the base priority
is the value of the NORMAL relative priority for that specific class. The base
priorities for each priority class are:

@ REALTIME PRIORITY.CLASS—24.
HIGH PRIORITY_CLASS—13.

ABOVE_NORMAL PRIORITY-CLASS—10.

@ NORMAL PRIORITY_CLASS—8.
« BELOW_NORMAL PRIORITY-CLASS—6.

e IDLE PRIORITY.CLASS—4.
