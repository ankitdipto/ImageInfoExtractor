SECTION 16 FlipeFlops 27

Excitation Tables

The characteristic tables of flip-flops specify the next state when the inputs and
the present stateare known. During the design of sequential circuits we usually
know the required transition from present state to next state and wish to find
the flip-flop input conditions that will cause the required transition. For this
reason we need a table that lists the required input combinations for a given
change of state, Such a table is called a flip-flop excitation table.

Table 1-3 lists the excitation tables for the four types of flip-flops. Each
table consists of two columns, Q(t) and Q(t + 1), and a column for each input
to show how the required transition is achieved. There are four possible
transitions from present state Q(t) to next state Q(t + 1). The required input
conditions for each of these transitions are derived from the information
available in the characteristic tables. The symbol x in the tables represents a
don’t-care condition; that is, it does not matter whether the input to the
flip-flop is 0 or 1.

The reason for the don’t-care conditions in the excitation tables is that
there are two ways of achieving the required transition. For example, in a JK
flip-flop, a transition from present state of 0 to a next state of 0 can be achieved
by having inputs J and K equal to 0 (to obtain no change) or by letting J = 0
and K = 1 to clear the flip-flop (although it is already cleared). In both cases
J must be 0, but K is 0 in the first case and 1 in the second. Since the required
transition will occur in either case, we mark the K input with a don‘t-care x
