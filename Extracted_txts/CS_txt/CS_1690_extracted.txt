support as well. The scheduling algorithms for these three operating systems
typically favor interactive over batch and CPU-bound processes.

6.1 A CPU-scheduling algorithm determines an order for the execution of its
scheduled processes. Given n processes to be scheduled on one processor,
how many different schedules are possible? Give a formula in terms of n.

6.2 Define the difference between preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling.
State why strict nonpreemptive scheduling is unlikely to be used in a
computer center.

6.3 Consider the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU-burst
time given in milliseconds:

Process BurstTime Priority

Py 10 3
Py 1 1
P3 2 3
Py 1 4
Ps 5 2

The processes are assumed to have arrived in the order Pj, P2, P3, Ps, Ps,
all at time 0.

a. Draw four Gantt charts illustrating the execution of these processes
using FCFS, SJF, a nonpreemptive priority (a smaller priority number
implies a higher priority), and RR (quantum = 1) scheduling.

b. What is the turnaround time of each process for each of the schedul-
ing algorithms in part a?

c. What is the waiting time of each process for each of the scheduling
algorithms in part a?

d. Which of the schedules in part a results in the minimal average
waiting time (over all processes)?

6.4 Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times
indicated. Each process will run the listed amount of time. In answering
the questions, use nonpreemptive scheduling and base all decisions on the
information you have at the time the decision must be made.
