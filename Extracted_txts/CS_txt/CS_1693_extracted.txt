feedback queues require parameters to define the number of queues, the
scheduling algorithms for each queue, the criteria used to move processes
between queues, and so on.

These algorithms are thus really sets of algorithms (for example, the
set of RR algorithms for all time slices, and so on). One set of algorithms
may include another (for example, the FCFS algorithm is the RR algorithm
with an infinite time quantum). What (if any) relation holds between the
following pairs of sets of algorithms?

a. Priority and SJF

b. Multilevel feedback queues and FCFS
Â¢. Priority and FCFS

d. RRand SJF

6.9 Suppose that a scheduling algorithm (at the level of short-term CPU
scheduling) favors those processes that have used the least processor time
in the recent past. Why will this algorithm favor I/O-bound programs and
yet not permanently starve CPU-bound programs?

6.10 Explain the differences in the degree to which the following scheduling
algorithms discriminate in favor of short processes:

a. FCFS
b. RR

c. Multilevel feedback queues

Bibliographical Notes

Lampson [1968] provided general discussions concerning scheduling. More
formal treatments of scheduling theory were contained in Kleinrock [1975],
Sauer and Chandy [1981], and Lazowska et al. [1984]. A unifying approach
to scheduling was presented by Ruschizka and Fabry [1977]. Haldar and
Subramanian [1991] discuss fairness in processor scheduling in time-sharing
systems.

Feedback queues were originally implemented on the CTSS system
described in Corbato et al. [1962]. This feedback queueing system was
analyzed by Schrage [1967]; variations on multilevel feedback queues were
studied by Coffman and Kleinrock [1968]. Additional studies were presented
by Coffman and Denning [1973] and Svobodova [1976]. A data structure for
manipulating priority queues was presented by Vuillemin [1978].

Anderson et al. [1989] discussed thread scheduling. Discussions concerning
multiprocessor scheduling were presented by Jones and Schwarz [1980], Tucker
