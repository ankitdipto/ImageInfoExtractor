Discussions concerning scheduling in real-time systems were offered by
Liu and Layland [1973], Abbot [1984], Jensen et al. [1985], Hong et al. [1989],
and Khanna et al. [1992]. A special issue on real-time operating systems was
edited by Zhao [1989]. Eykholt et al. [1992] described the real-time component

Fair-share schedulers were covered by Henry [1984], Woodside [1986], and
Kay and Lauder [1988].

Details concerning scheduling in Solaris 2, Windows 2000, and Linux can be
found in Mauro and McDougall [2001], Solomon and Russinovich [2000], and
Bovet and Cesati [2001] respectively.
