Consider five philosophers who spend their lives thinking and eating. The
philosophers share a common circular table surrounded by five chairs, each
belonging to one philosopher. In the center of the table is a bowl of rice, and
the table is laid with five single chopsticks (Figure 7.16). When a philosopher

pher gets hungry and tries to pick up the two chopsticks that are closest to
her (the chopsticks that are between her and her left and right neighbors). A
philosopher may pick up only one chopstick at a time. Obviously, she cannot
pick up a chopstick that is already in the hand of a neighbor. When a hungry
philosopher has both her chopsticks at the same time, she eats without releas-
