construct. A programmer who needs to write her own tailor-made synchro-
nization scheme can define one or more variables of type condition:

condition x, y;

The only operations that can be invoked on a condition variable are wait
and signal. The operation

x.wait(;

means that the process invoking this operation is suspended until another
process invokes

x.signal();

The x. signal () operation resumes exactly one suspended process. If no
process is suspended, then the signal operation has no effect; that is, the state
of x is as though the operation were never executed (Figure 7.21). Contrast
this operation with the signal operation associated with semaphores, which
always affects the state of the semaphore.

Now suppose that, when the x. signal () operation is invoked by a pro-
cess P, there is a suspended process Q associated with condition x. Clearly, if the
