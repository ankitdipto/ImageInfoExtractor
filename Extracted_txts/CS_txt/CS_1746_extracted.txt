Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

 

 

Now repeat the exercise using a representation based on the mereological approach, in which,
for example, Water is an object containing as parts all the water in the world.

83 Encode the description of the 4-bit adder in Figure 8.10 and pose queries to verify that it is
in fact correct.

84 Write definitions for the following:
a. ExhaustivePartDecomposition
b. PartPartition
c. PartwiseDisjoint
These shouldbe analogous to those for ExhaustiveDecomposition, Partition, and Disjoint.

85 Write a set of sentences that allows one to calculate the price of an individual tomato (or
other object), given the price per pound. Extend the theory to allow the price of a bag of tomatoes
to be calculated.

86 This exercise concerns the relationships between event categories and the time intervals in
which they occur.
a. Define the predicate T(c, i) in terms of SubEvent and â‚¬
b. Explain precisely why we do not need two different notations (A and A) to describe
conjunctive event categories.
c. Give a formal definition for T(pV 4, i).
d. Give formal definitions for T(=p,i) and T(-p.i), analogous to those using V and V.

8.7 Define the predicate Fixed, where Fixed(Location(x)means that the location of object x is
fixed over time

88 Define the predicates Before, After, During, and Overlap using the predicate Meet and the
functions Start and End, but not the function Time or the predicate <.
