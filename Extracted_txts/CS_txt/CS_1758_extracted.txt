The semaphore concept was suggested by Dijkstra [1965a]. Patil [1971]
examined the question of whether semaphores can solve all possible synchro-
nization problems. Parnas [1975] discussed some of the flaws in Patil’s argu-
ments. Kosaraju [1973] followed up on Patil’s work to produce a problem that
cannot be solved by wait and signal operations. Lipton [1974] discussed the
limitations of various synchronization primitives.

The classic process-coordination problems that we have described are
paradigms for a large class of concurrency-control problems. The bounded-
buffer problem, the dining-philosophers problem, and the sleeping-barber
problem (Exercise 6.7) were suggested by Dijkstra [1965a] and Dijkstra [1971].
The cigarette-smokers problem (Exercise 6.8) was developed by Patil [1971].
The readers—writers problem was suggested by Courtois et al. [1971]. The issue
of concurrent reading and writing was discussed by Lamport [1977]. The prob-
lem of synchronization of independent processes was discussed by Lamport
[1976].

The critical-region concept was suggested by Hoare [1972] and by Brinch-
Hansen [1972]. The monitor concept was developed by Brinch-Hansen [1973].
A complete description of the monitor was given by Hoare [1974]. Kessels
[1977] proposed an extension to the monitor to allow automatic signaling.
General discussions concerning concurrent programming were offered by Ben-
Ari [1990].

Some details of the locking mechanisms used in Solaris 2 are presented in
Mauro and McDougall [2001]. Note that the locking mechanisms used by the
kernel are implemented for user-level threads as well, so the same types of locks
are available inside and outside of the kernel. Details of the Windows 2000
synchronization can be found in Solomon and Russinovich [2000].

The write-ahead log scheme was first introduced in System R by Gray et al.
[1981]. The concept of serializability was formulated by Eswaran et al. [1976] in
connection with their work on concurrency control for System R. The two-phase
locking protocol was introduced by Eswaran et al. [1976]. The timestamp-
based concurrency-control scheme was provided by Reed [1983]. An exposition
of various timestamp-based concurrency-control algorithms was presented by
Bernstein and Goodman [1980].
