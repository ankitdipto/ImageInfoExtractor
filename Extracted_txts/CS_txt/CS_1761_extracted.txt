Figure 8-7 Numerical example for addressing modes.

‘The mode field of the instruction can specify any one of a number of
modes. For each possible mode we calculate the effective address and the
operand that must be loaded into AC. In the direct address mode the effective
address is the address part of the instruction 500 and the operand to be loaded
into AC is 800. In the immediate mode the second word of the instruction is
taken as the operand rather than an address, so 500 is loaded into AC. (The
effective address in this case is 201.) In the indirect mode the effective address
is stored in memory at address 500. Therefore, the effective address is 800 and
the operand is 300. In the relative mode the effective address is 500 + 202 =
702 and the operand is 325, (Note that the value in PC after the fetch phase and
during the execute phase is 202.) In the index mode the effective address is
XR +500 = 100 + 500 = 600 and the operand is 900. In the register mode the
operand is in R1 and 400 is loaded into AC. (There is no effective address in
this case.) In the register indirect mode the effective address is 400, equal to
the content of R1 and the operand loaded into AC is 700. The autoincrement
mode is the same as the register indirect mode except that R1 is incremented
to 401 after the execution of the instruction. The autodecrement mode decre-
ments Rl to 399 prior to the execution of the instruction. The operand loaded
into AC is now 450. Table 8-4 lists the values of the effective address and the
operand loaded into AC for the nine addressing modes.
