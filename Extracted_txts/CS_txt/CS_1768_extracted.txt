Chapter 8. Building a Knowledge Base

* Which classes, individuals, relations, and so on, would you need? What are their parents,
siblings and so on? (You will need events and temporal ordering, among other things.)

+ Where would they fit in a more general hierarchy?

+ What are the constraints and interrelationships among them?

+ How detailed must you be about each of the various concepts?

The knowledge base you construct must be capable of answering a list of questions that we will
give shortly. Some of the questions deal with the material stated explicitly in the story, but most
of them require one to know other background knowledge—to read between the lines. You'll
have to deal with what kind of things are at a supermarket, what is involved with purchasing the
things one selects, what will purchases be used for, and so on. Try to make your representation
as general as possible. To give a trivial example: don't say "People buy food from Safeway,"
because that won't help you with those who shop at another supermarket. Don't say "Joe made
spaghetti with the tomatoes and ground beef," because that won't help you with anything else at
all. Also, don't turn the questions into answers; for example, question (c) asks "Did John buy
any meat?—not "Did John buy a pound of ground beef?"

Sketch the chains of reasoning that would answer the questions. In the process ofdoing so,
you will no doubt need to create additional concepts, make additional assertions, and so on. If
possible, use a logical reasoning system to demonstrate the sufficiency of your knowledge base.
Many of the things you write may only be approximately correct in reality, but don't worry too
much; the idea is to extract the common sense that lets you answer these questions at all.

8.16 Make the necessary additions/changes to your knowledge base from the previous exercise
so that the following questions can be answered. Show that they can indeed be answered by
the KB, and include in your report a discussion of the fixes, explaining why they were needed,
whether they were minor or major, and so on. 9

a. Are there other people in Safeway while John is there? [Yes—staff!]

b. Did Mary see John? [Yes]

c. Is John a vegetarian? [No]

d. Who owns the deodorant in Safeway? [Safeway Corporation]

e. Did John have an ounce of ground beef? [Yes]

f. Does the Shell station next door have any gas? [Yes]

g. Do the tomatoes fit in John's car trunk? [Yes]
