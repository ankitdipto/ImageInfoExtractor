Figure 8.8 Traffic deadlock for Exercise 8.4.

leave the resources of CPU time, memory, and disk space. Is it possible
to have a deadlock involving these resources? If it is, how could such a
deadlock occur? If it is not, why not? What deadlock scheme would seem
best to eliminate these deadlocks (if any are possible), or what condition
is violated (if they are not possible)?

Consider the traffic deadlock depicted in Figure 8.8.

a. Show that the four necessary conditions for deadlock indeed hold in
this example.

b. State a simple rule that will avoid deadlocks in this system.

Suppose that a system is in an unsafe state. Show that it is possible for the
processes to complete their execution without entering a deadlock state.

Ina real computer system, neither the resources available nor the demands
of processes for resources are consistent over long periods (months).
Resources break or are replaced, new processes come and go, new
resources are bought and added to the system. If deadlock is controlled
by the bankerâ€™s algorithm, which of the following changes can be made
safely (without introducing the possibility of deadlock), and under what
circumstances?

a. Increase Available (new resources added)
