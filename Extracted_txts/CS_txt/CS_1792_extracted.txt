type banker’s scheme cannot be implemented by individual application
of the single-resource-type scheme to each resource type.

Cana system detect that some of its processes are starving? If you answer
“yes,” explain how it can. If you answer “no,” explain how the system can
deal with the starvation problem.

Consider the following snapshot of a system:

Allocation Max Available

ABCD ABCD ABCD
Po 0012 * 0012 1520
P, 1000 1750
P, 1354 2356
P3 0632 0652
Py 0014 0656

Answer the following questions using the banker’s algorithm:
a. What is the content of the matrix Need?
b. Is the system in a safe state?

c. If a request from process P, arrives for (0,4,2,0), can the request be
granted immediately?

Consider the following resource-allocation policy. Requests and releases
for resources are allowed at any time. If a request for resources cannot
be satisfied because the resources are not available, then we check any
processes that are blocked, waiting for resources. If they have the desired
resources, then these resources are taken away from them and are given
to the requesting process. The vector of resources for which the waiting
process is waiting is increased to include the resources that were taken
away.

For example, consider a system with three resource types and the vector
Available initialized to (4,2,2). If process Pp asks for (2,2,1), it gets them. If
P, asks for (1,0,1), it gets them. Then, if Po asks for (0,0,1), it is blocked
(resource not available). If P2 now asks for (2,0,0), it gets the available one
(1,0,0) and one that was allocated to Po (since Po is blocked). Po’s Allocation
vector goes down to (1,2,1), and its Need vector goes up to (1,0,1).

a. Can deadlock occur? If so, give an example. If not, which necessary
condition cannot occur?

b. Can indefinite blocking occur?
