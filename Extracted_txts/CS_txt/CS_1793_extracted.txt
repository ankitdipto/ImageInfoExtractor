270 Chapter8 Deadlocks

8.15 Suppose that you have coded the deadlock-avoidance safety algorithm
and now have been asked to implement the deadlock-detection algorithm.
Can you do so by simply using the safety algorithm code and redefining
Max; = Waiting; + Allocation;, where Waiting; is a vector specifying the
resources process i is waiting for, and Allocation; is as defined in Section
8.5? Explain your answer.

Bibliographical Notes

Dijkstra [1965a] was one of the first and most influential contributors in the
deadlock area. Holt [1972] was the first person to formalize the notion of
deadlocks in terms of a graph-theoretical model similar to the one presented
in this chapter. Starvation was covered by Holt [1972]. Hyman [1985] provided
the deadlock example from the Kansas legislature.

The various prevention algorithms were suggested by Havender [1968],
who has devised the resource-ordering scheme for the IBM 05/360 system.

The bankerâ€™s algorithm for avoiding deadlocks was developed for a single
resource type by Dijkstra [1965a], and was extended to multiple resource types
by Habermann [1969]. Exercises 8.8 and 8.9 are from Holt [1971].

The deadlock-detection algorithm for multiple instances of a resource type,
which was described in Section 8.6.2, was presented by Coffman et al. [1971].

Bach [1987] describes how many of the algorithms in the traditional UNIX
kernel handle deadlock.
