STORAGE
MANAGEMENT

 

 

The main purpose of a computer system is to execute programs. These pro-
grams, together with the data they access, must be in main memory (at least
partially) during execution.

To improve both the utilization of the CPU and the speed of its response to
users, the computer must keep several processes in memory. Many memory-
management schemes exist, reflecting various approaches, and the effective-
ness of each algorithm depends on the situation. Selection of a memory-
management scheme for a system depends on many factors, especially on
the hardware design of the system. Each algorithm requires its own hardware
support.

Since main memory is usually too small to accommodate all the data and
programs permanently, the computer system must provide secondary storage
to back up main memory. Modern computer systems use disks as the primary
on-line storage medium for information (both programs and data). The file
system provides the mechanism for on-line storage of and access to both data
and programs residing on the disks. A file is a collection of related information
defined by its creator. The files are mapped by the operating system onto
physical devices. Files are normally organized into directories to ease their use.
