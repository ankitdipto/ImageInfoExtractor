final binding is delayed until load time. If the starting address changes, we
need only to reload the user code to incorporate this changed value.

¢ Execution time: If the process can be moved during its execution from
one memory segment to another, then binding must be delayed until run
time. Special hardware must be available for this scheme to work, as will
be discussed in Section 9.1.2. Most general-purpose operating systems use
this method.
