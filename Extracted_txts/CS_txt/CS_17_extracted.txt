Moreover, by Corollary 24.3, vj.d is finite fori = 1,2,..., k. Thus,

which contradicts inequality (24.1). We conclude that the Bellman-Ford algorithm
returns TRUE if graph G contains no negative-weight cycles reachable from the
source, and FALSE otherwise. :

Exercises

241-1

Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.4, using ver-
tex z as the source. In each pass, relax edges in the same order as in the figure, and
show the d and z values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge (z,x)
to 4 and run the algorithm again, using s as the source.

24.1-2
Prove Corollary 24.3.

241-3

Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with no negative-weight cycles,
let m be the maximum over all vertices v € V of the minimum number of edges
in a shortest path from the source s to v. (Here, the shortest path is by weight, not
the number of edges.) Suggest a simple change to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that
allows it to terminate in m + 1 passes, even if m is not known in advance.

241-4
Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it sets v.d to —oo for all vertices v for
which there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from the source to v.
