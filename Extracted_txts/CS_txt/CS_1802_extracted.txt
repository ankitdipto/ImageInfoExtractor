An Example Proof 267

 

their (suitably instantiated) conclusion patterns. We will begin with the situation as it might be
described in English:

The law says that it is a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations.
The country Nono, an enemy of America, has some missiles, and all of its missiles
were sold to it by Colonel West, who is American.

What we wish to prove is that West is a criminal. We first represent these facts in first-order
logic, and then show the proof as a sequence of applications of the inference rules.”

“... itis a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations":
Vx,y. 2 American(x) A Weapon(yA Nation(z)A Hostile(z)

A Sells(x, z, y) => Criminal(x) OD

"Nono ... has some missiles":

Ax Owns(Nono, x) A Missile(x) (9.2)
"All of its missiles were sold to it by Colonel West":

Vx Owns(Nono,x)A Missile(x) => Sells( West, Nono,x) (9.3)
We will also need to know that missiles are weapons:

Vx Missile(x) => Weapon(x) (9.4)
and that an enemy of America counts as "hostile":

Vx Enemy(x, America) > Hostile(x) (9.5)
"West, who is American ...”:

American( West) (9.6)
"The country Nono ...":

Nation(Nono) (9.7)
"Nono, an enemy of America ...”:

Enemy(Nono, America) (9.8)

Nation(America) (9.9)
The proof consists ofa series of applications of the inference rules:
From (9.2) and Existential Elimination:

Owns(Nono,M1) A Missile(M1) (9.10)
From (9.10) and And-Elimination:

Owns(Nono, M1) (AL)

Missile(M\) (9.12)
From (9.4) and Universal Elimination:

Missile(M1) = Weapon(Ml) (9.13)

2 Our representation of the facts will not be ideal according to the standards of Chapter 8, because this is mainly an
exercise in proofrather than knowledge representation.
