9.4.1 Basic Method

Physical memory is broken into fixed-sized blocks called frames. Logical
memory is also broken into blocks of the same size called pages. When a process
is to be executed, its pages are loaded into any available memory frames from
the backing store. The backing store is divided into fixed-sized blocks that are
of the same size as the memory frames.

The hardware support for paging is illustrated in Figure 9.6. Every address
generated by the CPU is divided into two parts: a page number (p) and a page
offset (d). The page number is used as an index into a page table. The page
table contains the base address of each page in physical memory. This base
address is combined with the page offset to define the physical memory address
that is sent to the memory unit. The paging model of memory is shown in
Figure 9.7.

The page size (like the frame size) is defined by the hardware. The size
of a page is typically a power of 2, varying between 512 bytes and 16 MB per
page, depending on the computer architecture. The selection of a power of 2
as a page size makes the translation of a logical address into a page number
and page offset particularly easy. If the size of logical-address space is 2", and
a page size is 2" addressing units (bytes or words), then the high-order m — 1
bits of a logical address designate the page number, and the n low-order bits
designate the page offset. Thus, the logical address is as follows:
