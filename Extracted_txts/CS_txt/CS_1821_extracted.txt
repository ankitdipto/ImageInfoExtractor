Figure 9.10 Paging hardware with TLB.

If the TLB does not support separate ASIDs, every time a new page table is
selected (for instance, each context switch), the TLB must be flushed (or erased)
to ensure that the next executing process does not use the wrong translation
information. Otherwise, there could be old entries in the TLB that contain valid
virtual addresses but have incorrect or invalid physical addresses left over from
the previous process.

The percentage of times that a particular page number is found in the TLB
is called the hit ratio. An 80-percent hit ratio means that we find the desired
page number in the TLB 80 percent of the time. If it takes 20 nanoseconds
to search the TLB, and 100 nanoseconds to access memory, then a mapped-
memory access takes 120 nanoseconds when the page number is in the TLB.
If we fail to find the page number in the TLB (20 nanoseconds), then we must
first access memory for the page table and frame number (100 nanoseconds),
and then access the desired byte in memory (100 nanoseconds), for a total of
220 nanoseconds. To find the effective memory-access time, we must weigh
each case by its probability:

effective access time = 0.80 x 120 + 0.20 x 220
= 140 nanoseconds.
