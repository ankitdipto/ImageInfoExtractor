wasteful in these cases to create a page table with entries for every page in the
address range. Most of this table would be unused, but would take up valuable
memory space. Some systems provide hardware, in the form of a page-table
length register (PTLR), to indicate the size of the page table. This value is
checked against every logical address to verify that the address is in the valid
range for the process. Failure of this test causes an error trap to the operating
system.

9.4.4 Structure of the Page Table

In this section we explore some of the most common techniques for structuring
the page table.

9.4.4.1 Hierarchical Paging

Most modern computer systems support a large logical-address space (2 to
2). In such an environment, the page table itself becomes excessively large.
For example, consider a system with a 32-bit logical-address space. If the page
size in sucha system is 4 KB (2), then a page table may consist of up to 1 million
