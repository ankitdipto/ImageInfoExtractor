entries (2Â°*/2'). Assuming that each entry consists of 4 bytes, each process may
need up to 4 MB of physical-address space for the page table alone. Clearly, we
would not want to allocate the page table contiguously in main memory. One
simple solution to this problem is to divide the page table into smaller pieces.
There are several ways to accomplish this division.

One way is to use a two-level paging algorithm, in which the page table
itself is also paged (Figure 9.12). Remember our example to our 32-bit machine
with a page size of 4 KB. A logical address is divided into a page number
consisting of 20 bits, and a page offset consisting of 12 bits. Because we page
the page table, the page number is further divided into a 10-bit page number
and a 10-bit page offset. Thus, a logical address is as follows:
