physical address where the segment resides in memory, whereas the segment
limit specifies the length of the segment.

The use of a segment table is illustrated in Figure 9.18. A logical address
consists of two parts: a segment number, s, and an offset into that segment, d.
The segment number is used as an index into the segment table. The offset d of
the logical address must be between 0 and the segment limit. If it is not, we trap
to the operating system (logical addressing attempt beyond end of segment). If
this offset is legal, it is added to the segment base to produce the address in
physical memory of the desired byte. The segment table is thus essentially an
array of base—limit register pairs.

‘As an example, consider the situation shown in Figure 9.19. We have five
segments numbered from 0 through 4. The segments are stored in physical
memory as shown. The segment table has a separate entry for each segment,
giving the beginning address of the segment in physical memory (or base) and
the length of that segment (or limit). For example, segment 2 is 400 bytes long
