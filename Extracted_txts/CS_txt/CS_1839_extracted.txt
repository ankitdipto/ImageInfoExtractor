308 Chapter 9 Memory Management

sharing processes must define the shared code segment to have the same
segment number.

For instance, if we want to share the Sqrt routine, and one process wants
to make it segment 4 and another wants to make it segment 17, how should.
the Sqrt routine refer to itself? Because there is only one physical copy of Sart,
it must refer to itself in the same way for both users—it must have a unique
segment number. As the number of users sharing the segment increases, so
does the difficulty of finding an acceptable segment number.
