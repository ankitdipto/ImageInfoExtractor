9.6 Segmentation with Paging 311

consisting of 20 bits, and a page offset consisting of 12 bits. Since we page
the page table, the page number is further divided into a 10-bit page directory
pointer and a 10-bit page table pointer. The logical address is as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

page number page offset
Pi P2
10 10 12

The address-translation scheme for this architecture is similar to the scheme
shown in Figure 9.13, The Intel address translation is shown in more detail in
Figure 9.21. To improve the efficiency of physical-memory use, Intel 386 page
tables can be swapped to disk. In this case, an invalid bit is used in the page-
directory entry to indicate whether the table to which the entry is pointing is
