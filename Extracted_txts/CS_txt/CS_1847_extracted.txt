What are the physical addresses for the following logical addresses?

a. 0430
b. 110
c. 2500
d. 3400

9.17 Consider the Intel address-translation scheme shown in Figure 9.21.

a. Describe all the steps that are taken by the Intel 80386 in translating
a logical address into a physical address.

b. What are the advantages to the operating system of hardware that
provides such complicated memory-translation hardware?

c. Are there any disadvantages to this address-translation system? If
so, what are they? If not, why is it not used by every manufacturer?

9.18 In the IBM/370, memory protection is provided through the use of keys.
A key is a 4-bit quantity. Each 2 KB block of memory has a key (the
storage key) associated with it. The CPU also has a key (the protection
key) associated with it. A store operation is allowed only if both keys are
equal, or if either is zero. Which of the following memory-management
schemes could be used successfully with this hardware?

a. Bare machine

b. Single-user system

c. Multiprogramming with a fixed number of processes

d. Multiprogramming with a variable number of processes
e. Paging

f. Segmentation
