316 Chapter9 Memory Management

Bibliographical Notes

Dynamic storage allocation was discussed by Knuth [1973] (Section 2.5), who
found through simulation results that first fit is generally superior to best fit.
Knuth [1973] discussed the 50-percent rule.

The concept of paging can be credited to the designers of the Atlas system,
which has been described by Kilburn et al. [1961] and by Howarth et al.
[1961]. The concept of segmentation was first discussed by Dennis [1965].
Paged segmentation was first supported in the GE 645, on which MULTICS was
originally implemented (Organick [1972]).

Inverted page tables were discussed in an article about the IBM RT storage
manager by Chang and Mergen [1988].

Address translation in software is covered in Jacob and Mudge [1997].

Cache memories, including associative memory, were described and ana-
lyzed by Smith [1982]. This paper also includes an extensive bibliography on
the subject. Hennessy and Patterson [1996] discussed the hardware aspects of
TLBs, caches, and MMUs. Talluri et al. [1995] discusses page tables for 64-bit
address spaces. Dougan et al. [1999] discusses a technique for managing the
TLB.

The Motorola 68000 microprocessor family was described in Motorola
[1989a]. Information on the paging hardware of 80386 can be found in Intel
[1986]. Tanenbaum [2001] also discussed Intel 80386 paging. The Intel 80486
hardware also is described in an Intel publication Intel [1989].

Memory management for several architectures—such as the Pentium II,
PowerPC, and UltraSPARC —was described by Jacob and Mudge [1998a].
