instead on the problem to be programmed. On systems that support virtual
memory, overlays have almost disappeared.

In addition to separating logical memory from physical memory, virtual
memory also allows files and memory to be shared by several different pro-
cesses through page sharing (Section 9.4.5). The sharing of pages further allows
performance improvements during process creation.

Virtual memory is commonly implemented by demand paging. It can
also be implemented in a segmentation system. Several systems provide a
paged segmentation scheme, where segments are broken into pages. Thus, the
user view is segmentation, but the operating system can implement this view
with demand paging. Demand segmentation can also be used to provide vir-
tual memory. Burroughsâ€™ computer systems have used demand segmentation.
The IBM OS/2 operating system also uses demand segmentation. However,
segment-replacement algorithms are more complex than are page-replacement
algorithms because the segments have variable sizes. We do not cover demand
segmentation in this text; refer to the Bibliographical Notes for relevant refer-
ences.
