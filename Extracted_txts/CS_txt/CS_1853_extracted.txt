10.2 = Demand Paging

A demand-paging system is similar to a paging system with swapping (Figure
10.2). Processes reside on secondary memory (which is usually a disk). When
we want to execute a process, we swap it into memory. Rather than swapping
the entire process into memory, however, we use a lazy swapper. A lazy
swapper never swaps a page into memory unless that page will be needed.
Since we are now viewing a process as a sequence of pages, rather than as one
large contiguous address space, use of swap is technically incorrect. A swapper
manipulates entire processes, whereas a pager is concerned with the individual
pages of a process. We thus use pager, rather than swapper, in connection with
demand paging.

10.2.1 Basic Concepts

When a process is to be swapped in, the pager guesses which pages will be
used before the process is swapped out again. Instead of swapping in a whole
process, the pager brings only those necessary pages into memory. Thus, it
avoids reading into memory pages that will not be used anyway, decreasing
the swap time and the amount of physical memory needed.
