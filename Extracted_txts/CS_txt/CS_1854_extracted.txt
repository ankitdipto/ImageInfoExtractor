10.2 Demand Paging 321

With this scheme, we need some form of hardware support to distinguish
between those pages that are in memory and those pages that are on the disk.
The valid—invalid bit scheme described in Section 9.4.4 can be used for this
purpose. This time, however, when this bit is set to “valid,” this value indicates
that the associated page is both legal and in memory. If the bit is set to “invalid,”
this value indicates that the page either is not valid (that is, not in the logical
address space of the process), or is valid but is currently on the disk. The
page-table entry for a page that is brought into memory is set as usual, but the
page-table entry for a page that is not currently in memory is simply marked
invalid, or contains the address of the page on disk. This situation is depicted
in Figure 10.3.

Notice that marking a page invalid will have no effect if the process never
attempts to access that page. Hence, if we guess right and page in all and only
those pages that are actually needed, the process will run exactly as though we
