had brought in all pages. While the process executes and accesses pages that
are memory resident, execution proceeds normally.

But what happens if the process tries to access a page that was not brought
into memory? Access to a page marked invalid causes a page-fault trap.
The paging hardware, in translating the address through the page table, will
notice that the invalid bit is set, causing a trap to the operating system. This
trap is the result of the operating system’s failure to bring the desired page
into memory (in an attempt to minimize disk-transfer overhead and memory
requirements), rather than an invalid address error as a result of an attempt to
use an illegal memory address (such as an incorrect array subscript). We must
therefore correct this oversight. The procedure for handling this page fault is
straightforward (Figure 10.4):

1. We check an internal table (usually kept with the process control block)
for this process, to determine whether the reference was a valid or invalid
memory access.
