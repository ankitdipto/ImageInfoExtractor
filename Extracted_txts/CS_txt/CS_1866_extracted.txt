need for 60 frames, when only 40 are available. Although this situation may be
unlikely, it becomes much more likely as we increase the multiprogramming
level, so that the average memory usage is close to the available physical
memory. (In our example, why stop at a multiprogramming level of six, when
we can move to a level of seven or eight?)

Further, consider that system memory is not used only for holding program
pages. Buffers for I/O also consume a significant amount of memory. This use
can increase the strain on memory-placement algorithms. Deciding how much
memory to allocate to I/O and how much to program pages is a significant
challenge. Some systems allocate a fixed percentage of memory for I/O buffers,
whereas others allow both user processes and the 1/O subsystem to compete for
all system memory.

Over-allocation manifests itself as follows. While a user process is execut-
ing, a page fault occurs. The hardware traps to the operating system, which
checks its internal tables to see that this page fault is a genuine one rather than
an illegal memory access. The operating system determines where the desired
page is residing on the disk, but then finds that there are no free frames on the
free-frame list: All memory is in use (Figure 10.6).

The operating system has several options at this point. It could terminate
the user process. However, demand paging is the operating system’s attempt to
improve the computer system’s utilization and throughput. Users should not
