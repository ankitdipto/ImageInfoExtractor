10.4 Page Replacement 333

b. If there is no free frame, use a page-replacement algorithm to select a
victim frame.

c. Write the victim page to the disk; change the page and frame tables
accordingly.

3. Read the desired page into the (newly) free frame; change the page and
frame tables.

4. Restart the user process.

Notice that, if no frames are free, f7vo page transfers (one out and one in) are
required. This situation effectively doubles the page-fault service time and
increases the effective access time accordingly.

We can reduce this overhead by using a modify bit (or dirty bit). Each page
or frame may have a modify bit associated with it in the hardware. The modify
bit for a page is set by the hardware whenever any word or byte in the page is
written into, indicating that the page has been modified. When we select a page
for replacement, we examine its modify bit. If the bit is set, we know that the
page has been modified since it was read in from the disk. In this case, we must
write that page to the disk. If the modify bit is not set, however, the page has
not been modified since it was read into memory. Therefore, if the copy of the
