10.4 Page Replacement 335

For example, if we trace a particular process, we might record the following
address sequence:

0100, 0432, 0101, 0612, 0102, 0103, 0104, 0101, 0611, 0102, 0103,
0104, 0101, 0610, 0102, 0103, 0104, 0101, 0609, 0102, 0105,

which, at 100 bytes per page, is reduced to the following reference string
1,4,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,6,1.

To determine the number of page faults for a particular reference string and
page-replacement algorithm, we also need to know the number of page frames
available. Obviously, as the number of frames available increases, the number
of page faults decreases. For the reference string considered previously, for
example, if we had three or more frames, we would have only three faults, one
fault for the first reference to each page. On the other hand, with only one
frame available, we would have a replacement with every reference, resulting
in 11 faults. In general, we expect a curve such as that in Figure 10.8. As the
number of frames increases, the number of page faults drops to some minimal
level. Of course, adding physical memory increases the number of frames.

To illustrate the page-replacement algorithms, we shall use the reference
string

7,0, 1, 2,0, 3,0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2,0, 1,7,0,1

for a memory with three frames.
