10.4.2 FIFO Page Replacement

The simplest page-replacement algorithm is a FIFO algorithm. A FIFO replace-
ment algorithm associates with each page the time when that page was brought
into memory. When a page must be replaced, the oldest page is chosen. Notice
that it is not strictly necessary to record the time when a page is brought in. We
can create a FIFO queue to hold all pages in memory. We replace the page at the
head of the queue. When a page is brought into memory, we insert it at the tail
of the queue.

For our example reference string, our three frames are initially empty. The
first three references (7, 0, 1) cause page faults, and are brought into these empty
frames, The next reference (2) replaces page 7, because page 7 was brought in
first. Since 0 is the next reference and 0 is already in memory, we have no fault
for this reference. The first reference to 3 results in page 0 being replaced, since
it was the first of the three pages in memory (0, 1, and 2) to be brought in.
Because of this replacement, the next reference, to 0, will fault. Page 1 is then
replaced by page 0. This process continues as shown in Figure 10.9. Every time
a fault occurs, we show which pages are in our three frames. There are 15 faults
altogether.

The FIFO page-replacement algorithm is easy to understand and program.
However, its performance is not always good. The page replaced may be an
initialization module that was used a long time ago and is no longer needed.
On the other hand, it could contain a heavily used variable that was initialized
early and is in constant use.

Notice that, even if we select for replacement a page that is in active use,
everything still works correctly. After we page out an active page to bring ina
new one, a fault occurs almost immediately to retrieve the active page. Some
other page will need to be replaced to bring the active page back into memory.
Thus, a bad replacement choice increases the page-fault rate and slows process
execution, but does not cause incorrect execution.

To illustrate the problems that are possible with a FIFO page-replacement
algorithm, we consider the reference string,

1,2, 3,4, 1, 2,5, 1, 2,3,4,5.
