Figure 10.10 Page-fault curve for FIFO replacement on a reference string.

Figure 10.10 shows the curve of page faults versus the number of available
frames. We notice that the number of faults for four frames (10) is greater than
the number of faults for three frames (nine)! This most unexpected result is
known as Belady’s anomaly: For some page-replacement algorithms, the page-
fault rate may increase as the number of allocated frames increases. We would
expect that giving more memory to a process would improve its performance.
In some early research, investigators noticed that this assumption was not
always true. Belady’s anomaly was discovered as a result.

10.4.3 Optimal Page Replacement

One result of the discovery of Belady’s anomaly was the search for an optimal
page-replacement algorithm. An optimal page-replacement algorithm has the
lowest page-fault rate of all algorithms, and will never suffer from Belady’s
anomaly. Such an algorithm does exist, and has been called OPT or MIN. It is
simply

Replace the page that will not be used
for the longest period of time.

Use of this page-replacement algorithm guarantees the lowest possible page-
fault rate for a fixed number of frames.

For example, on our sample reference string, the optimal page-replacement
algorithm would yield nine page faults, as shown in Figure 10.11. The first three
references cause faults that fill the three empty frames. The reference to page
