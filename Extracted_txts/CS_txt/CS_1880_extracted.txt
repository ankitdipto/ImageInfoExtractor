chance will not be replaced until all other pages are replaced (or given second
chances). In addition, if a page is used often enough to keep its reference bit set,
it will never be replaced.

One way to implement the second-chance (sometimes referred to as the
clock) algorithm is as a circular queue. A pointer indicates which page is to be
replaced next. When a frame is needed, the pointer advances until it finds a
page with a 0 reference bit. As it advances, it clears the reference bits (Figure
40.14). Once a victim page is found, the page is replaced, and the new page
is inserted in the circular queue in that position. Notice that, in the worst
case, when all bits are set, the pointer cycles through the whole queue, giving
each page a second chance. It clears all the reference bits before selecting the
next page for replacement. Second-chance replacement degenerates to FIFO
replacement if all bits are set.
