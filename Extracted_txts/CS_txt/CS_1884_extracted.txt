For the 8-bit ALU, V = 1 if the output is greater than +127 or less than
~128,

 

The status bits can be checked after an ALU operation to determine
certain relationships that exist between the values of A and B. If bit V is set after
the addition of two signed numbers, it indicates an overflow condition. If Zis
set after an exclusive-OR operation, it indicates that A = B. This is so because
x@Â®x = 0, and the exclusive-OR of two equal operands gives an all-0's result
which sets the Z bit A single bit in A can be checked to determine if it is Oor
1 by masking all bits except the bit in question and then checking the Z status
bit. For example, let A = 101x1100, where xis the bit to be checked. The AND
operation of A with B = 00010000 produces a result 000x000. If x = 0, the Z
status bit is set, but if x = 1, the Z bit is cleared since the result is not zero. The
AND operation can be generated with the TEST instruction listed in Table8-10
if the original content of A must be preserved.

 

  

Conditional Branch Instructions

Table8-11 givesa listof the most common branch instructions. Each mnemonic
isconstructedwith the letter B (for branch) andan abbreviation of the condition
name. When the opposite condition state is used, the letter N (for no) is
