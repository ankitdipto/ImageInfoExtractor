350 Chapter 10 Virtual Memory

To prevent thrashing, we must provide a process as many frames as it
needs. But how do we know how many frames it “needs”? There are several
techniques. The working-set strategy (Section 10.6.2) starts by looking at how
many frames a process is actually using. This approach defines the locality
model of process execution.
