Chapter |. Introduction

 

For the currently infeasible tasks. try to find out what the difficulties are and estimate when they
will be overcome.

1.6 Find an article written by a lay person in a reputable newspaper or magazine claiming
the achievement of some intelligent capacity by a machine, where the claim is either wildly
exaggerated or false. .

17 Fact, fiction, and forecast:

a. Find a claim in print by a reputable philosopher or scientist to the effect that a certain
capacity will never be exhibited by computers, where that capacity has now been exhibited.

b. Find a claim by a reputable computer scientist to the effect that a certain capacity would
be exhibited by a date that has since passed, without the appearance of that capacity.

c. Compare the accuracy of these predictions to predictions in other fields such as biomedicine,
fusion power, nanotechnology, transportation, or home electronics.

18 Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most important part of
intelligence, and that "higher-level" capacities are necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these
underlying facilities. Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been devoted
to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such as game playing and logical
inference to be easier, in many ways, than perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think
that AI’s traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?

1.9 "Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their programmers tell
them." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

1.10 "Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their genes tell them." Is
the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?
