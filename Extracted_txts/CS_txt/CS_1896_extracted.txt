The pageout algorithm uses several parameters to control the rate at which
pages are scanned (known as the scanrate). The scanrate is expressed in pages
per second and ranges from slowscan to fastscan. When free memory falls below
lotsfree, scanning occurs at slowscan pages per second and progresses to fastscan
depending upon the amount of free memory available. The default value of
slowscan is 100 pages per second. fastscan is typically set to (Total PhysicalPages)/2
pages per second with a maximum of 8,192 pages per second. This is shown in
Figure 10.19 (with fastscan set to the maximum).

The distance (in pages) between the hands of the clock is determined by
a system parameter handspread. The amount of time between the front hand
clearing a bit and the back hand investigating its value depends upon the
scanrate and the handspread. If scanrate is 100 pages per second and handspread is
1,024 pages, 10 seconds can pass between the time a bit is set by the front hand
and checked by the back hand. However, because of the demands placed on the
memory system, a scanrate of several thousand is not uncommon. This means
that the amount of time between checking and investigating a bit is often a few
seconds.

As described above, the pageout process checks memory four times per
second. However, if free memory falls below desfree (Figure 10.19) pageout
will run 100 times per second with the intention of keeping at least desfree
free memory available. If the pageout process in unable to keep the amount
of free memory for a 30-second average at desfree, the kernel begins swapping
processes, thereby freeing all pages allocated to the process. In general, the
kernel looks for processes that have been idle for long periods of time. Last,
