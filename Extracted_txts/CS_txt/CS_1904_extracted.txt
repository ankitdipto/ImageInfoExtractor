10.8 Other Considerations 361

have shown that object-oriented programs also tend to have a poor locality of
reference. Contrast these languages with Java, which does not provide pointers.
Java programs will have better locality of reference than C or C++ programs on
a virtual-memory system.

10.8.6 I/O Interlock

When demand paging is used, we sometimes need to allow some of the pages
to be locked in memory. One such situation occurs when I/O is done to or from
user (virtual) memory. I/O is often implemented by a separate I/O processor.
For example, a magnetic-tape controller is generally given the number of bytes
to transfer and a memory address for the buffer (Figure 10.20). When the
transfer is complete, the CPU is interrupted.

We must be sure the following sequence of events does not occur: A process
issues an I/O request, and is put in a queue for that I/O device. Meanwhile, the
CPU is given to other processes. These processes cause page faults, and, using
a global replacement algorithm, one of them replaces the page containing the
memory buffer for the waiting process. The pages are paged out. Some time
later, when the I/O request advances to the head of the device queue, the 1/O
