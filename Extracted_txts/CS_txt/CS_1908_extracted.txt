Exercises 365

the system establishes the corresponding physical location. Distinguish
between software and hardware operations.

10.4 Which of the following programming techniques and structures are
“good” for a demand-paged environment? Which are “bad”? Explain
your answers.

a. Stack
b. Hashed symbol table

. Sequential search

aa

. Binary search

e. Pure code

f. Vector operations
g- Indirection

10.5 Assume that we have a demand-paged memory. The page table is held in
registers. It takes 8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty frame
is available or if the replaced page is not modified, and 20 milliseconds if
the replaced page is modified. Memory-access time is 100 nanoseconds.

Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the
time. What is the maximum acceptable page-fault rate for an effective
access time of no more than 200 nanoseconds?

10.6 Consider the following page-replacement algorithms. Rank these algo-
rithms on a five-point scale from “bad” to “perfect” according to their
page-fault rate. Separate those algorithms that suffer from Belady’s
anomaly from those that do not.

a. LRU replacement

b. FIFO replacement

c. Optimal replacement

d. Second-chance replacement

10.7 When virtual memory is implemented in a computing system, it carries
certain costs and certain benefits. List those costs and the benefits. It is
possible for the costs to exceed the benefits. Explain what measures you
can take to ensure that this imbalance does not occur.

10.8 An operating system supports a paged virtual memory, using a central
processor with a cycle time of 1 microsecond. It costs an additional 1
microsecond to access a page other than the current one. Pages have 1,000
words, and the paging device is a drum that rotates at 3,000 revolutions
