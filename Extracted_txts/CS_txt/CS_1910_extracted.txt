per minute and transfers one million words per second. The following
statistical measurements were obtained from the system:

One percent of all instructions executed accessed a page other than
the current page.

Of the instructions that accessed another page, 80 percent accessed a
page already in memory.

¢ When a new page was required, the replaced page was modified 50
percent of the time.

Calculate the effective instruction time on this system, assuming that the
system is running one process only, and that the processor is idle during
drum transfers.

Consider a demand-paging system with the following time-measured

utilizations:

CPU utilization 20%
Paging disk 97.7%
Other I/O devices 5%

For each of the following, say whether it will (or is likely to) improve CPU
utilization. Explain your answers.

a. Install a faster CPU.
b. Install a bigger paging disk.

c. Increase the degree of multiprogramming.

a

. Decrease the degree of multiprogramming.
e. Install more main memory.

£. Install a faster hard disk, or multiple controllers with multiple hard
disks.

g. Add prepaging to the page-fetch algorithms.
h. Increase the page size.
Consider the two-dimensional array A:
int AC][] = new int [100] [100];

where A[0] [0] is stored at location 200, in a paged memory system with
pages of size 200. A small process resides in page 0 (locations 0 to 199)
for manipulating the A matrix; thus, every instruction fetch will be from

page 0.
