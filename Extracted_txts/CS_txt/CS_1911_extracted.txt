Exercises 367

For three page frames, how many page faults are generated by
the following array-initialization loops, using LRU replacement, and
assuming page frame 1 has the process in it, and the other two are
initially empty:

a. for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++)
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
ATi] fj] = 0;

b. for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++)
A[i] [j] = 0;

Consider the following page-reference string:
1,2,3,4, 2, 1,5, 6,2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 2,3, 6.

How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algo-
rithms, assuming one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven frames?
Remember that all frames are initially empty, so your first unique pages
will all cost one fault each.

¢ LRU replacement
¢ FIFO replacement
¢ Optimal replacement

Suppose that you want to use a paging algorithm that requires a reference
bit (such as second-chance replacement or working-set model), but the
hardware does not provide one. Sketch how you could simulate a
reference bit even if one were not provided by the hardware. Calculate
the cost of doing so.

You have devised a new page-replacement algorithm that you think may
be optimal. In some contorted test cases, Belady’s anomaly occurs. Is the
new algorithm optimal? Explain your answer.

Suppose that your replacement policy (in a paged system) is to examine
each page regularly and to discard that page if it has not been used since
the last examination. What would you gain and what would you lose by
using this policy rather than LRU or second-chance replacement?

Segmentation is similar to paging, but uses variable-sized “pages.”
Define two segment-replacement algorithms based on FIFO and LRU
page-replacement schemes. Remember that, since segments are not the
same size, the segment that is chosen to be replaced may not be big
enough to leave enough consecutive locations for the needed segment.
Consider strategies for systems where segments cannot be relocated, and
those for systems where they can.
