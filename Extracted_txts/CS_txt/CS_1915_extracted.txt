370 Chapter 10 Virtual Memory

and McKusick et al. [1996] respectively. Details of OS/2 and demand segmen-
tation were described by Iacobucci [1988]. Ganapathy and Schimmel [1998]
discuss operating system support for multiple page sizes.

Good discussions are available for the Intel 80386 paging hardware Intel
[1986] and the Motorola 68030 hardware Motorola [1989b]. Virtual-memory
management in the VAX/VMS operating system was discussed by Levy and
Lipman [1982]. Discussions concerning workstation operating systems and
virtual memory were presented byHagmann [1989]. A comparison of an imple-
mentation of virtual memory in the MIPS, PowerPC, and Pentium architectures
can be found in Jacob and Mudge [1998b]. A companion article (Jacob and
Mudge [1998a]) describes the hardware support necessary for implementation
of virtual memory in six different architectures, including the UltraSPARC.
