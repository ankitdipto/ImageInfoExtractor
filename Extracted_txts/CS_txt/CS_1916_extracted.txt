FILE-SYSTEM
INTERFACE

 

 

For most users, the file system is the most visible aspect of an operating system.
It provides the mechanism for on-line storage of and access to both data and
programs of the operating system and all the users of the computer system. The
file system consists of two distinct parts: a collection of files, each storing related
data, and a directory structure, which organizes and provides information about
all the files in the system. Some file systems have a third part, partitions, which
are used to separate physically or logically large collections of directories. In
this chapter, we consider the various aspects of files and the major directory
structures. We also discuss ways to handle file protection, necessary when
multiple users have access to files and we want to control by whom and in
what ways files may be accessed. Finally, we discuss the semantics of sharing
files among multiple processes, users, and computers.

11.1 = File Concept

Computers can store information on several different storage media, such as
magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, and optical disks. So that the computer system
will be convenient to use, the operating system provides a uniform logical
view of information storage. The operating system abstracts from the physical
properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage unit (the file). Files are
mapped, by the operating system, onto physical devices. These storage devices
are usually nonvolatile, so the contents are persistent through power failures
and system reboots.
