the name of the program that created it. This attribute is set by the operating
system during the create call, so its use is enforced and supported by the
system. For instance, a file produced by a word processor has the word
processor’s name as its creator. When the user opens that file, by double-
clicking the mouse on the icon representing the file, the word processor is
invoked automatically and the file is loaded, ready to be edited.

The UNIX system is unable to provide such a feature because it uses a crude
magic number stored at the beginning of some files to indicate roughly the
type of the file—executable program, batch file (or shell script), postscript file,
and so on. Not all files have magic numbers, so system features cannot be
based solely on this type of information. UNIX does not record the name of the
creating program, either. UNIX does allow file-name-extension hints, but these
extensions are not enforced or depended on by the operating system; they are
mostly to aid users in determining the type of contents of the file. Extensions
