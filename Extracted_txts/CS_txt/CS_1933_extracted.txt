designate the symbol chosen for the output of the flip-flop. Thus, in Fig. 1-25,
we have two input equations, designated D, and Ds. The first letter in each
symboldenotes the D input of a D flip-flop. The subscriptletter is the symbol
name of the flip-flop. The input equations are Boolean functions for flip-flop
input variables and can be derived by inspection of the circuit. Since the output
of the OR gate is connected to the Dinput of flip-flop A, we write the first input
equation as

Dy, = Ax + Br

where A and Bare the outputs of the two flip-flops and xis the external input.
Thesecond input equation is derived from the single AND gate whose output
is connected to the D input of flip-flop B:

Ds = A'x
