The two forms are notational variants of each other, and as we will see on page 281, any set
of sentences can be translated to either form. Historically, conjunctive normal form is more
common, but we will use implicative normal form, because we find it more natural.

It is important to recognize that resolution is a generalization ofmodus ponens. Clearly,
the implicative normal form is more general than Horn form, because the right-hand side can be a
disjunction, not just a single atom. But at first glance it seems that Modus Ponens has the ability
to combine atoms with an implication to infer a conclusion in a way that resolution cannot do.
This is just an illusion—once we realize that an atomic sentence “ in implicative normal form is
written as True = a, we can see that modus ponens is just a special case of resolution:

aaa 3
ft

Even though True =+ « is the "correct" way to write an atomic sentence in implicative normal
form, we will sometimes write 4 as an abbreviation.

Tre > a a> 3

equivalent to
aseq True => 3

Resolution proofs

One could use resolution in a forward- or backward-chaining algorithm, just as Modus Ponens is
used. Figure 9.5 shows a three-step resolution proof of S(4) from the KB in (9.41).

 

 

 

Pow) = Ow] — | Oy) * Su)

P(w) => S(w) True > P(x) VR(x)

 

 

 

 

 

[w/s}

 

True -> S(x) VR(x) Riz) > Slz)

 

 

 

 

 

{x/A, SA}

 

True => S(A)

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 9.5 A proof that 5(A) follows from the KB in (9.41), using resolution. Each “vee” in
the proof tree represents a resolution step: the two sentences at the top are the premises, and the
one at the bottom is the conclusion or resolvent. The substitution is shown for each resolution.
