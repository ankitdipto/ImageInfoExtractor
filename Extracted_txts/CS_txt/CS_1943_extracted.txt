system may allow the same file system to be mounted repeatedly, at different
mount points, or it may only allow one mount per file system.

Consider the actions of the Macintosh operating system. Whenever the
system encounters a disk for the first time (hard disks are found at boot time,
floppy disks are seen when they are inserted into the drive), the Macintosh
operating system searches for a file system on the device. If it finds one, it
automatically mounts the file system at the root level, adding a folder icon on
the screen labeled with the name of the file system (as stored in the device
directory). The user then is able to click on the icon and thus to display the
newly mounted file system.

The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems (95, 98, NT, and 2000)
maintains an extended two-level directory structure, with devices and parti-
tions assigned a drive letter. Partitions have a general graph directory structure
associated with the drive letter. The path to a specific file is then in the form
of drive- letter:\path\to\file. These operating systems automatically discover all
devices and mount all located file systems at boot time. In some systems, like
UNIX, the mount commands are explicit. A system configuration file contains a
list of devices and mount points for automatic mounting at boot time, but other
mounts may be executed manually.

File system mounting is further discussed in Sections 12.2.2 and A.7.5.

11.5 = File Sharing

In the previous sections, we explored the motivation for file sharing and some of
the difficulties involved in allowing users to share files. Such file sharing is very
desirable for users who want to collaborate and to reduce the effort required to
achieve a computing goal. Therefore, user-oriented operating systems must
accommodate the need to share files in spite of the inherent difficulties.
