406 Chapter 11 File-System Interface

to control whether a user can determine the existence of a file in a directory.
Sometimes, knowledge of the existence and name of a file may be significant in
itself. Thus, listing the contents of a directory must be a protected operation.
Therefore, if a path name refers to a file in a directory, the user must be allowed
access to both the directory and the file. In systems where files may have
numerous path names (such as acyclic or general graphs), a given user may
have different access rights to a file, depending on the path name used.

11.6.4 An Example: UNIX

In the UNIX system, directory protection is handled similarly to file protection.
That is, associated with each subdirectory are three fields—owner, group, and
universe—each consisting of the 3 bits rwx. Thus, a user can list the content of
a subdirectory only if the r bit is set in the appropriate field. Similarly, a user
can change his current directory to another current directory (say foo) only if the
x bit associated with the foo subdirectory is set in the appropriate field.

A sample directory listing from a UNIX environment is shown in Figure
11.13. The first field describes the file or directory’s protection. A d as the first
character indicates a subdirectory. Also shown are the number of links to the
file, the owner’s name, the group’s name, the size of the file in unit of bytes, the
creation date, and finally the file’s name (with optional extension).

11.7 = Summary

A file is an abstract data type defined and implemented by the operating
system. It is a sequence of logical records. A logical record may be a byte, a line
(fixed or variable length), or a more complex data item. The operating system
may specifically support various record types or may leave that support to the
application program.

The major task for the operating system is to map the logical file concept
onto physical storage devices such as magnetic tape or disk. Since the physical
record size of the device may not be the same as the logical record size, it may
