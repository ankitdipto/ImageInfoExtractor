a. How would you specify this protection scheme in UNIX?

b. Could you suggest another protection scheme that can be used more
effectively for this purpose than the scheme provided by UNIX?

11.13 Researchers have suggested that, instead of having an access list associ-
ated with each file (specifying which users can access the file, and how),
we should have a user control list associated with each user (specifying
which files a user can access, and how). Discuss the relative merits of
these two schemes.

Bibliographical Notes

General discussions concerning file systems were offered by Grosshans [1986].
Golden and Pechura [1986] described the structure of microcomputer file sys-
tems. Database systems and their file structures were described in full in
Silberschatz et al. [2001].

A multilevel directory structure was first implemented on the MULTICS
system (Organick [1972]). Most operating systems now implement multilevel
directory structures. These include UNIX (Ritchie and Thompson [1974]), the
Apple Macintosh operating system (Apple [1991]), and MS-DOS (Microsoft
[1991]).

The MS-DOS file system was described in Norton and Wilton [1988]. That of
VAX VMS was covered in Kenah et al. [1988] and DEC [1981]. The Network File
System (NFS), designed by Sun Microsystems, allows directory structures to be
spread across networked computer systems. Discussions concerning NES were
presented in Sandberg et al. [1985], Sandberg [1987], and Sun [1990]. NFS is fully
described in Chapter 16. The immutable-shared-files semantics was described
by Schroeder et al. [1985].

DNS was first proposed by Su [1982] and has gone through several revision
since, with Mockapetris [1987] adding several major features. Most recently,
Eastlake [1999] proposing security extensions to let DNS hold security keys.

LDAP, also known as X.509, is a derivative subset of the X.500 distributed
directory protocol. It was defined by Yeong et al. [1995] and has been imple-
mented on many operating systems. Interesting research is ongoing in the area
of file-system interfaces, in particular, on issues relating to file naming and
attributes. For example, the Plan 9 operating system from Bell Laboratories
(Lucent Technology) makes all objects look like file systems. Thus, to display
a list of processes on a system, a user simply lists the contents of the /; (proc
directory. Similarly, to display the time of day, a user needs only to type the file
/dev/time.
