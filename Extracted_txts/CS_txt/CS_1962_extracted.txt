Chapter 12

FILE-SYSTEM
IMPLEMENTATION

 

 

As we saw in Chapter 11, the file system provides the mechanism for on-line
storage and access to file contents, including data and programs. The file
system resides permanently on secondary storage, which is designed to hold a
large amount of data permanently. This chapter is primarily concerned with
issues surrounding file storage and access on the most common secondary-
storage medium, the disk. We explore ways to structure file use, to allocate
disk space, to recover freed space, to track the locations of data, and to interface
other parts of the operating system to secondary storage. Performance issues
are considered throughout the chapter.

12.1 = File-System Structure

Disks provide the bulk of secondary storage on which a file system is main-
tained. They have two characteristics that make them a convenient medium for
storing multiple files:

1. They can be rewritten in place; it is possible to read a block from the disk,
to modify the block, and to write it back into the same place.

2. They can access directly any given block of information on the disk. Thus, it
is simple to access any file either sequentially or randomly, and switching
from one file to another requires only moving the readâ€”write heads and
waiting for the disk to rotate.

We discuss disk structure in great detail in Chapter 14.
