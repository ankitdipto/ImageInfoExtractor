Figure 12.5 Contiguous allocation of disk space.

Contiguous allocation has some problems, however. One difficulty is
finding space for a new file. The implementation of the free-space-management
system, discussed in Section 12.5, determines how this task is accomplished.
Any management system can be used, but some are slower than others.

The contiguous disk-space-allocation problem can be seen to bea particular
application of the general dynamic storage-allocation problem discussed in
Section 9.3, which is how to satisfy a request of size n from a list of free
holes. First fit and best fit are the most common strategies used to select a
free hole from the set of available holes. Simulations have shown that both
first fit and best fit are more efficient than worst fit in terms of both time and
storage utilization. Neither first fit nor best fit is clearly best in terms of storage
utilization, but first fit is generally faster.

These algorithms suffer from the problem of external fragmentation. As
files are allocated and deleted, the free disk space is broken into little pieces.
External fragmentation exists whenever free space is broken into chunks. It
becomes a problem when the largest contiguous chunk is insufficient for a
request; storage is fragmented into a number of holes, no one of which is large
enough to store the data. Depending on the total amount of disk storage and the
average file size, external fragmentation may be a minor or a major problem.

Some older microcomputer systems used contiguous allocation on floppy
disks. To prevent loss of significant amounts of disk space to external fragmen-
tation, the user had to run a repacking routine that copied the entire file system
