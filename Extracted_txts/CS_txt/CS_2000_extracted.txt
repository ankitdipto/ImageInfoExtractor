Figure 12.15 Mounting in NFS. (a) Mounts. (b) Cascading mounts.

The figure shows the result of mounting $2:/usr/dir2 over U:/usr/local/dirl, which
is already remotely mounted from S7. Users can access files within dir2 on
U using the prefix /usr/local/dirl. If a shared file system is mounted over a
user’s home directories on all machines in a network, a user can log in to
any workstation and get his home environment. This property permits user
mobility.

One of the design goals of NFS was to operate in a heterogeneous envi-
ronment of different machines, operating systems, and network architectures.
The NES specification is independent of these media and thus encourages other
implementations. This independence is achieved through the use of RPC prim-
itives built on top of an External Data Representation (XDR) protocol used
between two implementation-independent interfaces. Hence, if the system con-
sists of heterogeneous machines and file systems that are properly interfaced to
NES, file systems of different types can be mounted both locally and remotely.

The NFS specification distinguishes between the services provided by a
mount mechanism and the actual remote-file-access services. Accordingly,
two separate protocols are specified for these services: a mount protocol,
and a protocol for remote file accesses, the NFS protocol. The protocols are
specified as sets of RPCs. These RPCs are the building blocks used to implement
transparent remote file access.

12.9.2 The Mount Protocol

The mount protocol establishes the initial logical connection between a server
and a client. In Sun’s implementation, each machine has a server process,
outside the kernel, performing the protocol functions.
