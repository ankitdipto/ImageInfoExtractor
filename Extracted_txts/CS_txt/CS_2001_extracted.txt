 

INTELLIGENT AGENTS

 

 

 

Inwhich we discuss what an intelligent agent does, how it is related to its environment,
how it is evaluated, and how we might go about building one.

2.1__INTRODUCTION

An agentis anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting
upon that environment through effectors. A human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs for
sensors, and hands, legs, mouth, and other body parts for effectors. A robotic agent substitutes
cameras and infrared range finders for the sensors and various motors for the effectors. A
software agent has encoded bit strings as its percepts and actions. A generic agent is diagrammed
in Figure 2.1.

Our aim in this book is to design agents that do a good job of acting on their environment.
First, we will be a little more precise about what we mean by a good job. Then we will talk about
different designs for successful agentsâ€”filling in the question mark in Figure 2.1. We discuss
some of the general principles used in the design of agents throughout the book, chief among
which is the principle that agents should know things. Finally, we show how to couple an agent
to an environment and describe several kinds of environments.

2.2 How AGENTS SHOULD ACT

RATIONAL AGENT

A rational agent is one that does the right thing. Obviously, this is better than doing the wrong
thing, but what does it mean? As a first approximation, we will say that the right action is the
one that will cause the agent to be most successful. That leaves us with the problem of deciding
how and when to evaluate the agent's success.
