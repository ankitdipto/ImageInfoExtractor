NBS service layer at the remote server. This call is reinjected to the VFS layer
on the remote system, which finds that it is local and invokes the appropriate
file-system operation. This path is retraced to return the result. An advantage
of this architecture is that the client and the server are identical; thus, a machine
may be a client, or a server, or both.

The actual service on each server is performed by several kernel processes
that provide a temporary substitute to a lightweight process (or threads) mech-
anism.

12.9.4 Path-Name Translation

Path-name translation is done by breaking the path into component names
and performing a separate NFS lookup call for every pair of component
name and directory vnode. Once a mount point is crossed, every component
lookup causes a separate RPC to the server. This expensive path-name-traversal
scheme is needed, since each client has a unique layout of its logical name space,
dictated by the mounts it performed. It would have been much more efficient
to hand a server a path name and to receive a target vnode once a mount point
was encountered. At any point, however, there can be another mount point for
the particular client of which the stateless server is unaware.
