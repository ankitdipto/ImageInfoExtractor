Network file systems, such as NFS, use client-server methodology to allow
users to access files and directories from remote machines as if they were on
local file systems. System calls on the client are translated into network pro-
tocols, and retranslated into file-system operations on the server. Networking
and multiple-client access create challenges in the areas of data consistency and
performance.

Due to the fundamental role that file systems play in system operation, their
performance and reliability is crucial. Techniques such as log structures and
caching help improve the performance, while log structures and RAID improve
reliability.

Consider a file currently consisting of 100 blocks. Assume that the
FCB (and the index block, in the case of indexed allocation) is already
in memory. Calculate how many disk I/O operations are required for
contiguous, linked, and indexed (single-level) allocation strategies, if, for
one block, the following conditions hold. In the contiguous-allocation
case, assume that there is no room to grow in the beginning, but room to
grow in the end. Assume that the block information to be added is stored
in memory.

a. The block is added at the beginning.
. The block is added in the middle.
. The block is added at the end.

c.
d. The block is removed from the beginning.

o

e. The block is removed from the middle.
f. The block is removed from the end.
Consider a system where free space is kept in a free-space list.

a. Suppose that the pointer to the free-space list is lost. Can the system
reconstruct the free-space list? Explain your answer.

b. Suggest a scheme to ensure that the pointer is never lost as a result
of memory failure.

What problems could occur if a system allowed a file system to be
mounted simultaneously at more than one location?

Why must the bit map for file allocation be kept on mass storage, rather
than in main memory?
