12.14 Consider the following backup scheme:
¢ Day 1: Copy to a backup medium all files from the disk.
¢ Day 2: Copy to another medium all files changed since day 1.
¢ Day 3: Copy to another medium all files changed since day 1.

This contrasts to the schedule given in Section 12.7.2 by having all sub-
sequent backups copy all files modified since the first full backup. What
are the benefits of this system over the one in Section 12.7.2? What are
the drawbacks? Are restore operations made easier or more difficult?
Explain your answer.

The Apple Macintosh disk-space management scheme was discussed in Apple
[1987] and Apple [1991]. The MS-DOS FAT system was explained in Norton and
Wilton [1988], and the O$/2 description is found in Iacobucci [1988]. These
operating systems use the Motorola MC68000 family (Motorola [1989a]) and
the Intel 8086 (Intel [1985b], Intel [1985a], Intel [1986], Intel [1990]) CPUs,
respectively. IBM allocation methods were described in Deitel [1990]. The
internals of the BSD UNIX system were covered in full in McKusick et al. [1996].
McVoy and Kleiman [1991] presented optimizations to these methods made in
SunOs.

Disk file allocation based on the buddy system was discussed by Koch
[1987]. A file-organization scheme that guarantees retrieval in one access was
discussed by Larson and Kajla [1984].

Disk caching was discussed by McKeon [1985] and Smith [1985]. Caching in
the experimental Sprite operating system was described in Nelson et al. [1988].
General discussions concerning mass-storage technology were offered by Chi
[1982] and Hoagland [1985]. Folk and Zoellick [1987] covered the gamut of file
structures. Silvers [2000] discusses implementing the page cache in the NetBSD
operating system.

The Network File System (NFS) is discussed in Sandberg et al. [1985],
Sandberg [1987], Sun [1990], and Callaghan [2000]. NFS and the UNIX File
System (UFS) are described in Vahalia [1996] and Mauro and McDougall [2001].
The Windows NT file system, NTFS, is described in Solomon [1998]. The Ext2
file system used in Linux is described in Bovet and Cesati [2001].
