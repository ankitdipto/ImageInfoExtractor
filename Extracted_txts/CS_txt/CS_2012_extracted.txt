I/O SYSTEMS

 

The devices that attach to a computer vary in many aspects. Some devices
transfer a character or a block of characters at a time. Some can be accessed
only sequentially, others randomly. Some transfer data synchronously, others
asynchronously. Some are dedicated, some shared. They can be read-only or
read—write. They vary greatly in speed. In many ways they are also the slowest
major component of the computer.

Because of all this device variation, the operating system needs to provide a
wide range of functionality to applications, to allow them to control all aspects
of the devices. One key goal of an operating system’s I/O subsystem is to
provide the simplest interface possible to the rest of the system. Because devices
are a performance bottleneck, another key is to optimize I/O for maximum
concurrency. We initially describe the myriad variations of I/O devices and
the ways in which operating systems control them. Afterwards we discuss the
more complicated I/O devices used for secondary and tertiary storage, and we
explain the special attention that operating systems must give them.
