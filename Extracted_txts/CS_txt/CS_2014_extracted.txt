I/O SYSTEMS

 

The two main jobs of a computer are I/O and processing. In many cases, the
main job is 1/O and the processing is merely incidental. For instance, when we
browse a web page or edit a file, our immediate interest is to read or enter some
information, not to compute an answer.

The role of the operating system in computer I/O is to manage and control
1/O operations and I/O devices. Although related topics appear in other
chapters, here we bring together the pieces to paint a complete picture of
I/O. First, we describe the basics of I/O hardware, because the nature of
the hardware interface places requirements on the internal facilities of the
operating system. Next, we discuss the I/O services provided by the operating
system, and the embodiment of these services in the application I/O interface.
Then, we explain how the operating system bridges the gap between the
hardware interface and the application interface. We also discuss the UNIX
System V STREAMS mechanism, which enables an application to assemble
pipelines of driver code dynamically. Finally, we discuss the performance
aspects of I/O, and the principles of operating-system design that improve the
1/0 performance.

13.1 = Overview
The control of devices connected to the computer is a major concern of

operating-system designers. Because I/O devices vary so widely in their func-
tion and speed (consider a mouse, a hard disk, and a CD-ROM jukebox), a
