serial and parallel ports. In the upper-right portion of the figure, four disks are
connected together on a SCSI bus plugged into a SCSI controller.

A controller is a collection of electronics that can operate a port, a bus, or
a device. A serial-port controller is a simple device controller. It is a single
chip (or portion of a chip) in the computer that controls the signals on the
wires of a serial port. By contrast, a SCSI bus controller is not simple. Because
the SCSI protocol is complex, the SCSI bus controller is often implemented as
a separate circuit board (or a host adapter) that plugs into the computer. It
typically contains a processor, microcode, and some private memory to enable
it to process the SCSI protocol messages. Some devices have their own built-in
controllers. If you look at a disk drive, you will see a circuit board attached to
one side. This board is the disk controller. It implements the disk side of the
protocol for some kind of connection, SCSI or IDE, for instance. It has microcode
and a processor to do many tasks, such as bad-sector mapping, prefetching,
buffering, and caching.

How can the processor give commands and data to a controller to accom-
plish an I/O transfer? The short answer is that the controller has one or more
registers for data and control signals. The processor communicates with the
controller by reading and writing bit patterns in these registers. One way that
