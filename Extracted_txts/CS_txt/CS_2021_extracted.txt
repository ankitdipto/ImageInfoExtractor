can distinguish between high- and low-priority interrupts, and can respond
with the appropriate degree of urgency. In modern computer hardware, these
three features are provided by the CPU and by the interrupt-controller hard-
ware.

Most CPUs have two interrupt request lines. One is the nonmaskable
interrupt, which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors.
The second interrupt line is maskable: It can be turned off by the CPU before
the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted. The
maskable interrupt is used by device controllers to request service.

The interrupt mechanism accepts an addressâ€”a number that selects a
specific interrupt-handling routine from a small set. In most architectures,
this address is an offset in a table called the interrupt vector. This vector
contains the memory addresses of specialized interrupt handlers. The purpose
of a vectored interrupt mechanism is to reduce the need for a single interrupt
