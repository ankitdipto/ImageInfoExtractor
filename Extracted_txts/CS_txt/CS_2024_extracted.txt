~ Saturation: If Sis a set ofclauses, and Pis a set of ground terms, then P(S), the saturation
of S with respect to P, is the set of all ground clauses obtained by applying all possible
consistent substitutions for variables in S with ground terms in P.

< Herbrand base: The saturation ofa set ofclauses S with respect to its Herbrand universe
is called the Herbrand base of S, written as Hs(S). For example, if5 contains just the clause
given above, then

Hs(S) = {P(A,F(A.A)) A Q(A,A)=> RIA, B),
P(B,F(B,A)) \ Q(B,A) => R(B,B),
P(F(A,A), F(F(A,A), A)) A QUF(A,A),A)=> —-RCF(A,A), B),
P(F(A,B), F(F(A, B), A) Q(F(A, B),A) => RCF(A,B), B).
oS}
Notice that both the Herbrand universe and the Herbrand base can be infinite even if the
original set of sentences S is finite.
These definitions allow us to state a form of Herbrand's theorem (Herbrand, 1930):

Ifa set of clauses S is unsatisfiable, then there exists a finite subset of Hs(S) that is also
unsatisfiable.

Let S’ be this finite subset. Now it will be useful to introduce the resolution closure of 5’,
which is the set ofall clauses derivable by repeated application of the resolution inference step to
clauses in S’ or their derivatives. (To construct this closure, we could run a breadth-first search to
completion using the resolution inference rule as the successor generator.) Let Tbe the resolution
closure ofS’, and let As: = {A;,A2,...,Ax} bethe set of atomic sentences occurring in S’, Notice
that because S’ is finite, Ay, must also be finite. And because the clauses in T are constructed
