compatible with an existing host controller interface (such as SCSI-2), or they
write device drivers to interface the new hardware to popular operating sys-
tems. Thus, new peripherals can be attached to a computer without waiting for
the operating-system vendor to develop support code.

Unfortunately for device-hardware manufacturers, each type of operating
system has its own standards for the device-driver interface. A given device
may ship with multiple device drivers—for instance, drivers for MS-DOS, Win-
dows 95/98, Windows NT/2000, and Solaris. Devices vary in many dimensions,
as illustrated in Figure 13.7.

¢ Character-stream or block: A character-stream device transfers bytes one
by one, whereas a block device transfers a block of bytes as a unit.

¢ Sequential or random-access: A sequential device transfers data in a fixed
order determined by the device, whereas the user of a random-access
device can instruct the device to seek to any of the available data storage
locations.

* Synchronous or asynchronous: A synchronous device is one that performs

data transfers with predictable response times. An asynchronous device
exhibits irregular or unpredictable response times.
