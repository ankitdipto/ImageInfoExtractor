Figure 13.7 Characteristics of 1/O devices.

© Sharable or dedicated: A sharable device can be used concurrently by
several processes or threads; a dedicated device cannot.

© Speed of operation: Device speeds range from a few bytes per second toa
few gigabytes per second.

« Read-write, read only, or write only: Some devices perform both input
and output, but others support only one data direction.

For the purpose of application access, many of these differences are hidden
by the operating system, and the devices are grouped into a few conventional
types. The resulting styles of device access have been found to be useful
and broadly applicable. Although the exact system calls may differ across
operating systems, the device categories are fairly standard. The major access
conventions include block I/O, character-stream 1/O, memory-mapped file
access, and network sockets. Operating systems also provide special system
calls to access a few additional devices, such as a time-of-day clock and a timer.
Some operating systems provide a set of system calls for graphical display,
video, and audio devices.

Most operating systems also have an escape (or back-door) that transpar-
ently passes arbitrary commands from an application to a device driver. In
UNIX, this system call is ioct1() (for I/O control). The ioct1() system call
enables an application to access any functionality that can be implemented by
any device driver, without the need to invent a new system call. The ioct1()
