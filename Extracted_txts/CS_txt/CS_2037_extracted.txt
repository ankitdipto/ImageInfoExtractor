networking, where buffers are used widely for fragmentation and reassembly
of messages. At the sending side, a large message is fragmented into small
network packets. The packets are sent over the network, and the receiving side
places them in a reassembly buffer to form an image of the source data.

A third use of buffering is to support copy semantics for application I/O.
An example will clarify the meaning of “copy semantics.” Suppose that an
application has a buffer of data that it wishes to write to disk. It calls the
write () system call, providing a pointer to the buffer and an integer specifying
the number of bytes to write. After the system call returns, what happens if
the application changes the contents of the buffer? With copy semantics, the
version of the data written to disk is guaranteed to be the version at the time
of the application system call, independent of any subsequent changes in the
application’s buffer. A simple way that the operating system can guarantee
copy semantics is for the write () system call to copy the application data into
a kernel buffer before returning control to the application. The disk write is
performed from the kernel buffer, so that subsequent changes to the application
buffer have no effect. Copying of data between kernel buffers and application
