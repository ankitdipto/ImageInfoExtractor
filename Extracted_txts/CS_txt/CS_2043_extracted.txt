480  Chapter13 I/O Systems

1/O request is scheduled. Eventually, the 1/O subsystem sends the request
to the device driver. Depending on the operating system, the request is sent
via a subroutine call or via an in-kernel message.

4. The device driver allocates kernel buffer space to receive the data, and
schedules the I/O. Eventually, the driver sends commands to the device
controller by writing into the device control registers.
