The number of registers available for each window is calculated as follows:

window size =

 

+2C+G
The total number of registers needed in the processor is
register file = (L + CW +G
In the example of Fig. 8-9 we have G = 10, L = 10, C = 6, and W =4. The

window size is 10 + 12 + 10 = 32 registers, and the register file consists of
(10 + 6) x 4 + 10 = 74 registers.

 

Berkeley RISC I

One of the first projects intended to show the advantages of RISC architecture
‘was conducted at the University of California, Berkeley. The Berkeley RISC I
isa 32-bit integrated circuit CPU. It supports 32-bit addresses and either 8-, 16-,
or 32-bit data. It has a 32-bit instruction format and a total of 31 instructions.
There are three basic addressing modes: register addressing, immediate
operand, and relative to PC addressing for branch instructions. Ithas aregister
file of 138 registers arranged into 10 global registers and 8 windows of 32
registers in each. The 32 registers in each windowhave an organization similar
to the one shown in Fig. 8-9. Since only one set of 32 registers in a window is
