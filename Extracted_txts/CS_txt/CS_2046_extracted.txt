entirely from members of As, T must be finite because only a finite number of distinct clauses
can be constructed from a finite vocabulary of atomic sentences. To illustrate these definitions,
we will use a slimmed-down example:
S' = { P(A), P(A) = QUA), QA) = False }
As = {P(A), Q(A), False}
T = { P(A), P(A) = Q(A), Q(A) = False, Q(A), P(A) = False, False }
Now we can state a completeness theorem for resolution on ground clauses. This is called the
ground resolution theorem:
Ifa set of ground clauses is unsatisfiable, then the resolution closure of those clauses

contains the clause False.
We prove this theorem by showing its contrapositive: if the closure T does not contain False,
then S’ is satisfiable; in fact, we can construct a satisfying assignment for the atomic sentences in
S''. The construction procedure is as follows:

Pick an assignment (True or False) for each atomic sentence in Ay in some fixed order

Aj. Ak

- If there is a clause in T containing the literal —A;, such that all its other literals are
false under the assignment chosen for Aj,. . . ,Aj_1, then assign A, to be False.
- Otherwise, assign A; to be True.

It is easy to show that the assignment so constructed will satisfy S’, provided T is closed under
resolution and does not contain the clause False (Exercise 9.10).

Now we have established that there is always a resolution proof involving some finite
subset of the Herbrand base of S. The next step is to show that there is a resolution proof using
the clauses of S itself, which are not necessarily ground clauses. We start by considering a single
application of the resolution rule. Robinson's basic lemma implies the following fact:

Let C, and C) be two clauses with no shared variables, and let C; and C’, be ground

instances of C\ and C). If C’ is a resolvent of C} and C5, then there exists a clause

C such that (1) C is a resolvent of C\ and C:, and (2) C’ is a ground instance of C.

This is called a lifting lemma, because it lifts a proof step from ground clauses up to general
first-order clauses. In order to prove his basic lifting lemma, Robinson had to invent unification
and derive all of the properties of most general unifiers. Rather than repeat the proofhere, we
simply illustrate the lemma:

C1 = P(x. FXA))A Q(x,A) => R(x, B)

Cr = N(GQ),2) = PCHQ).<

C= PCH(B), F(H(B),A)) \ Q(H(B),A=>  R(H(B), By

Cc N(G(B), F(H(B),A)) = P(H(B), F(H(B).A))

c N(G(B), F(H(B),A)) A Q(H(B), A= R(H(B), B)

C = NG), F(HQ),A)) A Q(HQ),A=> R(H(),B)
We see that indeed C’ is a ground instance of C. In general, for C/ and C’, to have any resolvents,
they must be constructed by first applying to C, and C, the most general unifier of a pair of
