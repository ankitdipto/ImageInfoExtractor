an interrupt. The interrupt is passed back up through the kernel to cause the
network I/O system call to complete.

Now, the remote system’s network hardware receives the packet, and an
interrupt is generated. The character is unpacked from the network proto-
cols and is given to the appropriate network daemon. The network daemon
identifies which remote login session is involved, and passes the packet to the
appropriate subdaemon for that session. Throughout this flow there are con-
text switches and state switches (Figure 13.12). Usually, the receiver echoes the
character back to the sender; that approach doubles the work.

The Solaris developers reimplemented the telnet daemon using in-kernel
threads to eliminate the context switches involved in moving each charac-
ter between daemons and the kernel. Sun estimates that this improvement
