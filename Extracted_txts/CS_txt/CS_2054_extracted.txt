Bibliographical Notes 489

Milenkovic [1987] discusses the complexity of I/O methods and implementa-
tion. The use and programming of the various interprocess-communication
and network protocols in UNIX is explored in Stevens [1992]. Brain [1996]
documents the Windows NT application interface. The I/O implementation in
the sample MINIX OS is described in Tanenbaum and Woodhulll [1997]. Custer
[1994] includes detailed information on the NT message-passing implementa-
tion of 1/0.

For details of hardware-level I/O handling and memory-mapping function-
ality, processor reference manuals (Motorola [1993] and Intel [1993}), are among
the best sources. Hennessy and Patterson [1996] describe multiprocessor sys-
tems and cache-consistency issues. Tanenbaum [1990] describes hardware 1/O
design at a low level, and Sargent and Shoemaker [1995] provide a program-
merâ€™s guide to low-level PC hardware and software. The IBM PC device I/O
address map is given in IBM [1983]. An issue of the March 1994 IEEE Computer
is devoted to advanced I/O hardware and software. Rago [1993] provides a
good discussion on STREAMS.
