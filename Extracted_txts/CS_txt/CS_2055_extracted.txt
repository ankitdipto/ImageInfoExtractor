The file system can be viewed logically as consisting of three parts. In Chapter
11, we saw the user and programmer interface to the file system. In Chapter 12,
we described the internal data structures and algorithms used by the operating
system to implement this interface. In this chapter, we discuss the lowest
level of the file system: the secondary and tertiary storage structures. We first
describe disk-scheduling algorithms that schedule the order of disk I/Os to
improve performance. Next, we discuss disk formatting and management of
boot blocks, damaged blocks, and swap space. We examine secondary storage
structure, covering disk reliability and stable-storage implementation. We
conclude with a brief description of tertiary storage devices, and the problems
that arise when an operating system uses tertiary storage.

14.1 = Disk Structure

Disks provide the bulk of secondary storage for modern computer systems.
Magnetic tape was used as an early secondary-storage medium, but the access
time is much slower than for disks. Thus, tapes are currently used mainly
for backup, for storage of infrequently used information, as a medium for
transferring information from one system to another, and for storing quantities
of data so large that they are impractical as disk systems. Tape storage is
described in Section 14.8.

Modern disk drives are addressed as large one-dimensional arrays of log-
ical blocks, where the logical block is the smallest unit of transfer. The size
