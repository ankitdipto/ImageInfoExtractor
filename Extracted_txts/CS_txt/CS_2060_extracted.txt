As we discussed in Chapter 2, whenever a process needs I/O to or from
the disk, it issues a system call to the operating system. The request specifies
several pieces of information:

¢ Whether this operation is input or output
¢ What the disk address for the transfer is
« What the memory address for the transfer is

¢ What the number of bytes to be transferred is

If the desired disk drive and controller are available, the request can be
serviced immediately. If the drive or controller is busy, any new requests for
service will be placed on the queue of pending requests for that drive. For
a multiprogramming system with many processes, the disk queue may often
have several pending requests. Thus, when one request is completed, the
operating system chooses which pending request to service next.

14.2.1 FCFS Scheduling

The simplest form of disk scheduling is, of course, the first-come, first-served
(FCES) algorithm. This algorithm is intrinsically fair, but it generally does not
provide the fastest service. Consider, for example, a disk queue with requests
for I/O to blocks on cylinders

98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67,

in that order. If the disk head is initially at cylinder 53, it will first move from
53 to 98, then to 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, and finally to 67, for a total head
movement of 640 cylinders. This schedule is diagrammed in Figure 14.1.

The wild swing from 122 to 14 and then back to 124 illustrates the problem
with this schedule. If the requests for cylinders 37 and 14 could be serviced
together, before or after the requests at 122 and 124, the total head movement
could be decreased substantially, and performance could be thereby improved.

14.2.2 SSTF Scheduling

It seems reasonable to service all the requests close to the current head position,
before moving the head far away to service other requests. This assumption is
the basis for the shortest-seek-time-first (SSTF) algorithm. The SSTF algorithm
selects the request with the minimum seek time from the current head position.
Since seek time increases with the number of cylinders traversed by the head,
SSTF chooses the pending request closest to the current head position.
