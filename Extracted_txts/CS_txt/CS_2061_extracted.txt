For our example request queue, the closest request to the initial head
position (53) is at cylinder 65. Once we are at cylinder 65, the next closest
request is at cylinder 67. From there, the request at cylinder 37 is closer than
98, so 37 is served next. Continuing, we service the request at cylinder 14, then
98, 122, 124, and finally 183 (Figure 14.2). This scheduling method results in
a total head movement of only 236 cylinders â€”little more than one-third of the
distance needed for FCFS scheduling of this request queue. This algorithm gives
a substantial improvement in performance.

SSTF scheduling is essentially a form of shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling,
and, like SJF scheduling, it may cause starvation of some requests. Remember
that requests may arrive at any time. Suppose that we have two requests in
