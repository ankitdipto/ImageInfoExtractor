the head will have to wait until the arm moves to the end of the disk, reverses
direction, and comes back.

The SCAN algorithm is sometimes called the elevator algorithm, since the
disk arm behaves just like an elevator in a building, first servicing all the
requests going up, and then reversing to service requests the other way.

Assuming a uniform distribution of requests for cylinders, consider the
density of requests when the head reaches one end and reverses direction. At
this point, relatively few requests are immediately in front of the head, since
these cylinders have recently been serviced. The heaviest density of requests
is at the other end of the disk. These requests have also waited the longest, so
why not go there first? That is the idea of the next algorithm.

14.2.4 C-SCAN Scheduling

Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling is a variant of SCAN designed to provide
a more uniform wait time. Like SCAN, C-SCAN moves the head from one end of
the disk to the other, servicing requests along the way. When the head reaches
the other end, however, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk,
without servicing any requests on the return trip (Figure 14.4). The C-SCAN
scheduling algorithm essentially treats the cylinders as a circular list that wraps
around from the final cylinder to the first one.

14.2.5 LOOK Scheduling

As we described them, both SCAN and C-SCAN move the disk arm across the
full width of the disk. In practice, neither algorithm is implemented this way.
More commonly, the arm goes only as far as the final request in each direction.
