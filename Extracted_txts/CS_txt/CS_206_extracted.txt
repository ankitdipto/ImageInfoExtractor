SECTION 1-4 Map Simplification 15

sums are OR terms and the product denotes the ANDing of these terms. With
a minor modification, a product-of-sums form can be obtained from a map.

The procedure for obtaining a product-of-sums expression follows from
the basic properties of Boolean algebra. The 1's in the map represent the
minterms that produce 1 for the function The squares not marked by 1
represent the minterms that produce 0 for the function. If we mark the empty
squares with 0's and combine them into groups of adjacent squares, we obtain
the complement of the function, F’. Taking the complement of F’ produces an
expression for F in product-of-sums form. The best way to show this is by
example.

We wish to simplify the following Boolean function in both sum-of-
products form and product-of-sums form:

F(A, B,C, D) = & (0, 1,2,5,8,9, 10)
The 1’s marked in the map of Fig. 1-11 represent the minterms that produce
1 for the function. The squares marked with 0's represent the minterms not
included in F and therefore denote the complement of F. Combining the
squares with 1's gives the simplified function in sum-of-products form:

F=B'D'+ BC’ +A'CD

If the squares marked with 0's are combined, as shown in the diagram, we
obtain the simplified complemented function:

 

F'= AB +CD + BD’

Taking the complement of F’, we obtain the simplified function in product-of-
sums forme

F=(A’ + BYC’ + D'\(B’ + D)

Figure 1-11 Map for F(A, B, C, D) = 5 (0,1,2,5,8,9,10).
