Figure 14.7 4.3 BSD text-segment swap map.

The data-segment swap map is more complicated, because the data seg-
ment can grow over time. The map is of fixed size, but contains swap addresses
for blocks of varying size. Given index i, a block pointed to by swap-map entry
iis of size 2' x 16 KB, to a maximum of 2 MB. This data structure is shown
in Figure 14.8. (The block size minimum and maximum are variable, and can
be changed at system reboot.) When a process tries to grow its data segment
beyond the final allocated block in its swap area, the operating system allocates
another block, twice as large as the previous one. This scheme results in small
processes using only small blocks. It also minimizes fragmentation. The blocks
of large processes can be found quickly, and the swap map remains small.

In Solaris 1 (SunOS 4), the designers made changes to standard UNIX meth-
ods to improve efficiency and reflect technological changes. When a process
executes, text-segment pages are brought in from the file system, accessed in
main memory, and thrown away if selected for pageout. It is more efficient to
reread a page from the file system than to write it to swap space and then to
reread it from there.

More changes were made in Solaris 2. The biggest change is that Solaris 2
allocates swap space only when a page is forced out of physical memory, rather
than when the virtual-memory page is first created. This change gives better
performance on modern computers, which have more physical memory than
older systems and tend to page less.
