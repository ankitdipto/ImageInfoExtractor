14.5.3 RAID Levels

Mirroring provides high reliability, but it is expensive. Striping provides high
data-transfer rates, but it does not improve reliability. Numerous schemes to
provide redundancy at lower cost by using the idea of disk striping combined
with “parity” bits (which we describe next) have been proposed. These schemes
have different cost-performance tradeoffs and are classified into levels called
RAID levels. We describe the various levels here; Figure 14.9 shows them
pictorially (in the figure, P indicates error-correcting bits and C indicates a
second copy of the data). In all cases depicted in the figure, four disks’ worth of
