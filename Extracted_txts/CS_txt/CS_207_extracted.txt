To in the diagram will trigger only those cegishers whose control inputs are
cannected to timing signal Ts. SC is incement-d with every positive dock
transition, unless ts ClRinput is active. This produces the sequence of timing
signals Te, T, Tz, Ty Ts and so on, as shown in the diagram (Note the
relationship between the timing signal and its correspanding positive dock
transition.) If SC isnot deared, sre the ning signals wileouinus wih Te Te up
