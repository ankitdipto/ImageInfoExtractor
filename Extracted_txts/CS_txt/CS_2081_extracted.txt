space overhead, RAID level 5 is often preferred for storing large volumes of
data. Level 6 is not supported currently by many RAID implementations, but it
should offer better reliability than level 5.

RAID system designers have to make several other decisions as well. For
example, how many disks should be in an array? How many bits should be
protected by each parity bit? If more disks are in an array, data-transfer rates
are higher, but the system is more expensive. If more bits are protected by a
parity bit, the space overhead due to parity bits is lower, but the chance that a
second disk will fail before the first failed disk is repaired is greater, and that
will result in data loss.

One other aspect of most RAID implementations is a hot spare disk or disks.
A hot spare is not used for data, but is configured to be used as a replacement
should any other disk fail. For instance, a hot spare can be used to rebuild a
mirror pair should one of the disks in the pair fail. In this way, the RAID level
can be reestablished automatically, without waiting for the failed disk to be
replaced. Allocating more than one hot spare allows more than one failure to
be repaired without human intervention.
