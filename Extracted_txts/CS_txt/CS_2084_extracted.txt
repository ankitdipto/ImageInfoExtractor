A wide variety of storage devices are suitable for use as host-attached
storage. Among these are hard disk drives, RAID arrays, and CD, DVD, and
tape drives.

The I/O commands that initiate data transfers to a host-attached storage
device are reads and writes of logical data blocks, directed to specifically
identified storage units (such as bus ID, SCSI ID, and target logical unit, for
example).

14.6.2 Network-Attached Storage

A network-attached storage device is a special-purpose storage system that is
accessed remotely over a data network (Figure 14.11). Clients access network-
attached storage (NAS) via a remote-procedure-call interface such as NFS for
UNIX systems, or CIFS for Windows machines. The remote procedure calls
(RPCs) are carried via TCP or UDP over an IP networkâ€”usually the same local-
area network (LAN) that carries all data traffic to the clients. The network-
attached storage unit is usually implemented as a RAID array with software
that implements the remote procedure call interface. It is easiest to think of
NAS as simply another storage-access protocol. For example, rather than using
a SCSI device driver and SCSI protocols to access storage, a system using NAS
would use RPC over TCP/IP.

Network-attached storage provides a convenient way for all the computers
ona LAN to share a pool of storage, with the same ease of naming and access
enjoyed with local host-attached storage. However, it tends to be less efficient
and have lower performance than some direct-attached storage options.

14.6.3 Storage-Area Network

One drawback of network-attached storage systems is that the storage I/O
operations consume bandwidth on the data network, thereby increasing the
latency of network communication. This problem can be particularly acute
