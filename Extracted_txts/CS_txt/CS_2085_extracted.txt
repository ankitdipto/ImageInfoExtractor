in large client-server installationsâ€”the communication between servers and
clients competes for bandwidth with the communication among servers and
storage devices.

A storage-area network (SAN) is a private network (using storage protocols
rather than networking protocols) among the servers and storage units, sepa-
rate from the LAN or WAN that connects the servers to the clients (Figure 14.12).
The power of a SAN lies in its flexibility. Multiple hosts and multiple storage
arrays can attach to the same SAN, and storage can be dynamically allocated to
hosts. As one example, if a host is running low on disk space, the SAN can be
configured to allocate more storage to that host. In 2001, many proprietary
single-vendor SAN systems are available, but SAN components are not well
standardized or interoperable. Most SAN systems in 2001 are based on fibre-
channel loops or fibre-channel switched networks. One emerging alternative to
a fibre-channel interconnect for the SAN is storage over IP network infrastruc-
ture such as Gigabit Ethernet. Another potential alternative is a special-purpose
SAN architecture named Infiniband, which provides hardware and software
support for high-speed interconnection networks for servers and storage units.

14.7 = Stable-Storage Implementation

In Chapter 7, we introduced the write-ahead log, which required the availability
of stable storage. By definition, information residing in stable storage is never
lost. To implement such storage, we need to replicate the needed information
on multiple storage devices (usually disks) with independent failure modes.
We need to coordinate the writing of updates in a way that guarantees that
a failure during an update will not leave all the copies in a damaged state,
and that, when we are recovering from a failure, we can force all copies to a
