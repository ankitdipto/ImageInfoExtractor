Specify the control word that must be applied to the processor of Fig. &:2to
implement the following microoperations.

Determine the microoperations that will be executed in the processor of Fig.
8-2 when the following 14-bit contral wordsare applied.

Let SP = 000000 in the stack of Fig. 8:3. How many items are there in the
stack if:

a. FULL = 1 and EMTY = 0?

b. FULL = 0 and EMTY = 17

A stack is organized such that SP always points at the next empty location
(on the stack. This means that SP can be initialized to 4000 in Fig. 8-4 and the
first item in the stack is stored in location 4000. List the microoperations for
the push and pop operations.

A first-in, first-out (FIFO) has amemory organization that stores information
in such a manner that the item that is stored first is the first item that is
retrieved. Show how a FIFO memory operates with three counters. A write
counter WC holds the address for writing into memory. A read counter RC
holds the address for reading from memory. An available storage counter
ASC indicates the number of words stored in FIFO. ASCis incremented for
every word stored and decremented for every item that is retrieved.
