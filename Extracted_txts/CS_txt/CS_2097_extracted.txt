In summary, we say that a fixed disk drive is likely to be more reliable than
a removable disk or tape drive, and an optical disk is likely to be more reliable
than a magnetic disk or tape. But a fixed magnetic disk has one weakness. A
head crash in a hard disk generally destroys the data, whereas the failure of a
tape drive or optical disk drive often leaves the data cartridge unharmed.

14.8.3.3 Cost

Storage cost is another important factor. Here is a concrete example of how
removable media may lower the overall storage cost. Suppose that a hard disk
that holds X GB has a price of $200; of this amount, $190 is for the housing,
motor, and controller, and $10 is for the magnetic platters. Then, the storage
cost for this disk is $200/X per gigabyte. Now, suppose that we can manufacture
the platters in a removable cartridge. For one drive and 10 cartridges, the total
price is $190 + $100 and the capacity is 10X GB, so the storage cost is $29/X per
gigabyte. Even if it is a little more expensive to make a removable cartridge,
the cost per gigabyte of removable storage may well be lower than the cost per
gigabyte of a hard disk, because the expense of one drive is averaged with the
low price of many removable cartridges.

Figures 14.13, 14.14, and 14.15 show the cost trends per megabyte for DRAM
memory, magnetic hard disks, and tape drives. The prices in the graphs are the
lowest price found in advertisements in BYTE magazine and PC Magazine at the
end of each year. These prices reflect the small-computer marketplace of the
