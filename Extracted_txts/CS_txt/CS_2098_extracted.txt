readership of these magazines, where prices are low by comparison with the
mainframe and minicomputer markets. In the case of tape, the price is for a
drive with one tape. The overall cost of tape storage becomes much lower as
more tapes are purchased for use with the drive, because the price of a tape
is a small fraction of the price of the drive. However, in a huge tape library
containing thousands of cartridges, the storage cost is dominated by the cost of
the tape cartridges. As of this writing in 2001, the cost per GB of tape cartridges
can be approximated as $2.

The cost of DRAM fluctuates widely. In the period from 1981 to 2000, we
can see three price crashes (around 1981, 1989, and 1996), as excess production
caused a glut in the marketplace. We can also see two periods (around 1987 and
1993), where shortages in the marketplace caused significant price increases. In
the case of hard disks, the price declines have been much steadier, although
the price decline appears to have accelerated since 1992. Tape-drive prices also
fell steadily up to 1997. Since 1997 the price per gigabyte of inexpensive tape
drives has ceased its dramatic fall, although mid-range tape technology (such as
DAT/DDS) has continued to fall, and is now approaching that of the inexpensive
drives. Tape-drive prices are not shown prior to 1984, because BYTE magazine
is targeted to the small-computer marketplace, and tape drives were not widely
used with small computers prior to 1984.

By comparing these graphs we see that the price of disk storage has plum-
meted relative to the price of DRAM and tape.
