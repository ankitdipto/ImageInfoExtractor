Figure 14.15 Price per megabyte of a tape drive, from 1984 to 2000.

The price per megabyte of magnetic disk has improved by more than four
orders of magnitude during the past two decades, whereas the corresponding
improvement for main memory has only been three orders of magnitude. Main
memory today is more expensive than disk storage by a factor of 100.

The price per megabyte has dropped much more rapidly for disk drives
than for tape drives. In fact, the price per megabyte of magnetic disk drives
is approaching that of a tape cartridge without the tape drive. Consequently,
small- and medium-size tape libraries have a higher storage cost than disk
systems with equivalent capacity. The dramatic fall in disk prices has largely
rendered tertiary storage obsolete: We no longer have any tertiary storage
technology that is orders of magnitude less expensive than magnetic disk. It
appears that the revival of tertiary storage must await a revolutionary technol-
ogy breakthrough. Meanwhile, tape storage will find its use mostly limited to
purposes such as backups of disk drives and archival storage in enormous tape
libraries that greatly exceed the practical storage capacity of large disk farms.

14.9 = Summary

Disk drives are the major secondary-storage I/O device on most computers.
Requests for disk I/O are generated by the file system and by the virtual-
memory system. Each request specifies the address on the disk to be referenced,
in the form of a logical block number.
