make a few reasonable assumptions; state the assumptions that you
make.

a. How many disk drives would be required to hold 4 exabytes of
data?

 

b. How many magnetic tapes would be required to hold 4 exabytes of
data?

c. How many optical tapes would be required to hold 4 exabytes of
data (Exercise 14.28)?

d. How many holographic storage cartridges would be required to
hold 4 exabytes of data (Exercise 14.27)?

e. How many cubic feet of storage space would each option require?

14.30 Discuss how an operating system could maintain a free-space list for a
tape-resident file system. Assume that the tape technology is append-
only, and that it uses the EOT mark and locate, space, and read
position commands as described in Section 14.8.2.1.

Bibliographical Notes

Discussions of redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) are presented by
Patterson et al. [1988] and in the detailed survey of Chen et al. [1994]. Disk-
system architectures for high-performance computing are discussed by Katz
et al. [1989]. Teorey and Pinkerton [1972] present an early comparative analysis
of disk-scheduling algorithms. They use simulations that model a disk for
which seek time is linear in the number of cylinders crossed. For this disk,
LOOK is a good choice for queue lengths below 140, and C-LOOK is good for
queue lengths above 100. King [1990] describes ways to improve the seek time
by moving the disk arm when the disk is otherwise idle. Seltzer et al. [1990]
describe disk-scheduling algorithms that consider rotational latency in addition
to seek time. Worthington et al. [1994] discuss disk performance, and show
the negligible performance impact of defect management. The placement of
hot data to improve seek times has been considered by Ruemmler and Wilkes
[1991] and Akyurek and Salem [1993]. Ruemmler and Wilkes [1994] describe an
accurate performance model for a modern disk drive. Worthington et al. [1995]
tell how to determine low-level disk properties such as the zone structure, and
this work is further advanced by Schindler and Gregory [1999].

The I/O size and randomness of the workload has a considerable influence
on disk performance. Ousterhout et al. [1985] and Ruemmler and Wilkes [1993]
report numerous interesting workload characteristics, including that most files
are small, most newly created files are deleted soon thereafter, most files that
are opened for reading are read sequentially in their entirety, and most seeks
