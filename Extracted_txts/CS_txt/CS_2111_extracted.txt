are short. McKusick et al. [1984] describe the Berkeley Fast File System, which
uses many sophisticated techniques to obtain good performance for a wide
variety of workloads. McVoy and Kleiman [1991] discuss further improvements
to the basic FFS. Quinlan [1991] describes how to implement a file system on
WORM storage with a magnetic disk cache; Richards [1990] discusses a file-
system approach to tertiary storage. Maher et al. [1994] give an overview of the
integration of distributed file systems and tertiary storage.

The concept of a storage hierarchy has been studied for more than a quarter
of a century. For instance, a 1970 paper by Mattson et al. [1970] describes
a mathematical approach to predict the performance of a storage hierarchy.
Alt [1993] describes the accommodation of removable storage in a commercial
operating system, and Miller and Katz [1993] describe the characteristics of
tertiary-storage access in a supercomputing environment. Benjamin [1990]
gives an overview of the massive storage requirements for the EOSDIS project
at NASA.

Holographic-storage technology is the subject of an article by Psaltis and
Mok [1995]; a collection of holographic-storage papers dating from 1963 has
been assembled by Sincerbox [1994]. Asthana and Finkelstein [1995] describe
several emerging storage technologies, including holographic storage, optical
tape, and electron trapping. Toigo [2000] gives an in-depth description of
modern disk technology and several potential future storage technologies.
