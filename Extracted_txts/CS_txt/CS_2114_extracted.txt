DISTRIBUTED
SYSTEMS

 

 

A distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share memory or
a clock. Instead, each processor has its own local memory, and the processors
communicate with each other through communication lines such as local- or
wide-area networks. The processors in a distributed system vary in size and
function. Such systems may include small handheld or real-time devices,
personal computers, workstations, and large mainframe computer systems.

The benefits of a distributed system include user access to the resources
maintained by the system and therefore computation speedup and improved
data availability and reliability. A distributed file system is a file-service system
whose users, servers, and storage devices are dispersed among the sites of a
distributed system. Accordingly, service activity has to be carried out across
the network; instead of a single centralized data repository, there are multiple
and independent storage devices.

Because a system is distributed, however, it must provide mechanisms for
process synchronization and communication, for dealing with the deadlock
problem, and for dealing with failures that are not encountered in a centralized
system.
