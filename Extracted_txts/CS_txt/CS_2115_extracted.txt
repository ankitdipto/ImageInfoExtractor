A distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share memory or
aclock. Instead, each processor has its own local memory. The processors com-
municate with one another through various communication networks, such as.
high-speed buses or telephone lines. In this chapter, we discuss the general
structure of distributed systems and the networks that interconnect them. We
contrast the main differences in operating-system design between these sys-
tems and the centralized systems with which we were concerned previously.
Detailed discussions are given in Chapters 16 and 17.

= Background

A distributed system is a collection of loosely coupled processors intercon-
nected by a communication network. From the point of view of a specific
processor in a distributed system, the rest of the processors and their respective
resources are remote, whereas its own resources are local.

The processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function.
They may include small microprocessors, workstations, minicomputers, and
large general-purpose computer systems. These processors are referred to by a
number of names, such as sites, nodes, computers, machines, or hosts, depending
on the context in which they are mentioned. We mainly use site to indicate the
location of a machine, and host to refer to a specific system at a site. Generally,
one host at one site, the server, has a resource that another host at another site,
the client (or user), would like to use. The purpose of the distributed system is to
