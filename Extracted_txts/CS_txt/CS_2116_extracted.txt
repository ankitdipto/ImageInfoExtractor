Assuming an 8-bit computer, show the multiple precision addition of the
two32-bit unsigned numbersllsted below using the add with carry instruc-
tion. Each byte is expressed as a two-digit hexadecimal number.

(6E C3 56 7A) + (13 55 6B 8F)

Perform the logic AND, OR, and XOR with the two binary strings 10011100

and 10101010.

Given the 16-bit value 1001101011001101. What operation must be per

formed in order to:

a. clear to 0 the first eight bits?

b. set to 1 the last eight bits?

¢. complement the middle eight bits?

‘An & bit register contains the value 01111011 and the carry bit is equal to 1.

Perform the eight shift operations given by the instructions listed in Ta.

ble 89, Each time, start from the initial value given above.

Represent the following signed numbers in binary using eight bits. +83;

83; +68; 68.

1. Perform the addition (~83) + (+68) in binary and interpret the result
obtained.

b. Perform the subtraction (68) ~ (+83) in binary and indicate if there is
an overflow.

. Shift binary ~68 once to the right and give the value ofthe shifted number
in decimal

4. Shift binary -83 once to the left and indicate if there is an overflow.

Show that the circuit labeled “check for zero output” in Fig. 8-8 is an &-bit

NOR gate.

‘An 8 bit computer has a register R. Determine the values of status bits C,

S,Z, and V (Fig. 88) after each of the following instructions. The initial value

of register R in each case is hexadecimal 72 The numbers below are also in

hexadecimal,

a. Add immediate operand Cé to R.

b. Add immediate operand 1E to R.

¢. Subtract immediate operand 9A from R.

. AND immediate operand 8Dto R.

e. Exclusive-OR R with R.

‘Twounsigned numbers A and B are compared by subtracting A ~ B. The
carry status bit is considered as a borrow bit after a compare instruction in
‘most commercial computers, so that C = 1 if A < B. Show that the relative
‘magnitude of A and B canbe determined from inspection of status bits C and.
Zas specified in the table for Problem 8-26. (See also Table 8-11.)

‘Two signed numbers A and B represented in signed-2's complement form
are compared by subtracting A ~ B. Statusbits S, Z, and V are setor cleared
depending on the result of the operation. (Note that there is a sign reversal
