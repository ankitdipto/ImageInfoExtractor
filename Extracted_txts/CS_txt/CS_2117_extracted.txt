Itis necessary to design a digital circuit with four inputs C, 5, Z, and V and.

10 outputs, one for each of the branch conditions listed in Probs. 8-26 and

8-27, (The equal and unequal conditions are common to both tables.) Draw

the logic diagram of the circuit using two OR gates, one XOR gate, and five

inverters.

Consider the two 8-bit numbers A = 01000001 and B = 10000100.

4. Give the decimal equivalent of each number assuming that (1) they are
unsigned, and (2) they are signed.

b. Add the two binary numbers and interpret the sum assuming that the
numbers are (1) unsigned, and (2) signed.

¢. Determine the values of the C, Z, 5, and V status bits after the addition.

4. List the conditional branch instructions from Table 8-11 that will have a
true condition

‘The program in a computer compares two unsigned numbers A and B by

performing a subtraction A B and updating the status bits. Let A=

(01000001 and B = 10000100.

a. Evaluate the difference and interpret the binary result.

b. Determine the values of status bits C (borrow) and Z.

. List the conditional branch instructions from Table 8-11 that will have a
true condition
