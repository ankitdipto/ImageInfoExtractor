The program in a computer compares two signed numbers A and B by

performing the subtraction A - B and updating the status bits. Let A =

(1000001 and B = 10000100.

a. Evaluate the difference and interpret the binary result.

b. Determine the value of status bits S, Z, and V.

¢. Listthe conditional branch instructions from Table 8-11 that will have a
‘true condition.

‘The content of the top of a memory stack is 5320. The content of the stack

pointer SP is 3560. A two-word call subroutine instruction is located in

memory at address 1120 followed by the address field of 6720 at location.

1121, What are the content of PC, SP, and the top of the stack:

1. Before the call instruction is fetched from memory?

b. After the call instruction is executed?

. After the return from subroutine?

‘What are the basic differences between a branch instruction, a call subrou-

tine instruction, and program interrupt?

Give five examples of external interrupts and five examples of internal

interrupts. What is the difference between a software interrupt and a sub-

routine call?

‘A computer responds to an interrupt request signal by pushing onto the

stack the contents of PC and the current PSW (program status word). It then

reads anew PSW from memory fromalocation given by an interrupt address

symbolized by IAD. The first address of the service programis taken from

‘memory at location IAD + 1.

1. List the sequence of microoperations for the interrupt cycle.

. List the sequence of microoperations for the return from interrupt in-
struction

Examples of computers with variable instruction formats are IBM 370, VAX

11, and Intel 386. Compare the variable instruction formats of one af these

computers with the fixed-length instruction format used in RISC I.

Three computers use register windows with the following characteris-

tics. Determine the window size and the total number of registers in each

computer.

Computer 1 Computer 2 Computer 3

Global registers 10 8 16
Local registers 10 8 16
‘Common registers 6 8 16
Number of windows 8 4 16

Give an example of a RISC I instructions that will perform the following,
operations.

a. Decrement a register

b. Complement a register

¢. Negate a register
