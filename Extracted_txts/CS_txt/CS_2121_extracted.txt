SECTION 1-7 Sequential Circuits 31
The next state of B in the state table is equal to 1 when the present state of A
is 0 and input x is equal to 1 The output column is derived from the output
equation

y= Ax’ + Br’

The state table of any sequential circuit is obtained by the procedure used
in this example. In general, a sequential circuit with m flip-flops, n input
variables, and p output variables will contain m columns for present state, n
columns for inputs, m columns for next state, and p columns for outputs. The
present state and input columns are combined and under them we list the 2"*"
binary combinations from 0 through 2"*" - 1. The next-state and output
columns are functions of the present state and input values and are derived
directly from the circuit or the Boolean equations that describe the circuit.

State Diageam

The information available in a state table can be represented graphically in a
state diagram. In this type of diagram, a state is represented by a circle, and
the transition between states is indicated by directed lines connecting the
circles The state diagram of the sequential circuit of Fig. 1-25 is shown in Fig.
1-26, The state diagram provides the same information as the state table and
is obtained directly from Table 1-4. The binary number inside each circle
identifies the state of the flip-flops. The directed lines are labeled with two
binary numbers separated by a slash. The input value during the present state
is labeled first and the number after the slash gives the output during the
present state. For example, the directed line from state 00 to 01 is labeled 1/0,
meaning that when thesequential circuitis in the present state 00 and the input
