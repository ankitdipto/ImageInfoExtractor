9-1 Parallel Processing

Parallel processing is a term used to denote a large class of techniques that are
used to provide simultaneous data-processing tasks for the purpose of incieas-
ing the computational speed of a computer system. stead of processing each
instruction sequentially as in a conventional computer, a parallel processing
system is able to perform concurrent data process: ng to achieve faster execu-
don time. For example, while an instruction is being executed in the ALU, the
next instruction can be read from memory. The system may have two or more
ALUs and be able to execute two or more instructions at the same time.
Furthermore, the system may have two or more processors operating concur
rently. The purpose of paralle! proa-ssing is tospeed up the computer procese-
ing capability and increase its throughput, that is. the amount of processing
that can be accomplished duting 2 gven interval of time. The amount of
hardware increases with parallel processing, and withit. the costof the system
increases. However, technological developments havereduced hardware costs
to the paint where parallel processing techniques are economically feasible.
Parallel processing can be viewed from various levels of complexity. At
the lowest level, we distinguish between parallel and serial operations by the
type of registers used, Shift registers operate in serial fashion one bit at a time,
