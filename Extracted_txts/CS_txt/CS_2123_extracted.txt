multiple functional
units

while registers with parallel load operate with all the bits of the word simulta-
neously. Parallel processing at a higher level of complexity can be achieved by
having a multiplicity of functional units that perform identical or different
operations simultaneously. Parallel processing is established by distributing
the data among the multiple functional units. For example, the arithmetic,
logic, and shift operations can be separated into three units and the operands
diverted to each unit under the supervision of a control unit.

Figure 9-1 shows one possible way of separating the execution unit into
eight functional units operating in parallel. The operands in the registers are
applied to one of the units depending on the operation specified by the instruc-
