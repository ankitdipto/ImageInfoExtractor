9.10 In this exercise, you will complete the proof of the ground resolution theorem given in the
chapter. The proof rests on the claim that if Tis the resolution closure of a set of ground clauses }
Ss’, and T does not contain the clause False, then a satisfying assignment can be constructed for
S' using the construction given in the chapter. Show that the assignment does indeed satisfy s’,
as claimed.
