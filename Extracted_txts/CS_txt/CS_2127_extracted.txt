example. Suppose that we want to perform the combined multiply and add
operations with a stream of numbers.

AmB +C, fori =1,2,3,...,7

Each suboperation is to be implemented in a segment within a pipeline. Each

‘ent has one or two registers and a combinational circuit as shown in Fig.
9-2 R1 through R5 areregisters that receive new data with every clock pulse.
The multiplier and adder are combinational circuits. The suboperations per-
formed in each segment of the pipeline are as follows:

RMA, RIB, Input A,and B;
R3<R1*R2, R4<C, Multiply and input C,
RS—R3 + RA ‘Add C; to product

The five registers are loaded with new data every clock pulse. The effectofeach
lock is shown in Table 9-1. The first clock pulse transfers 4; and B, into R1 and
