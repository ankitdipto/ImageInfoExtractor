Figure 9.3. Four-segment pipeline.

segment number. The diagram shows six tasks; through T; executed in four
segments. Initially, task T, is handled by segment 1. After the first clock,
segment 2 is busy with 7,, while segment 1 is busy with task T;. Continuing
in this manner, the first task T, is completed after the fourth clock cycle. From
then on, the pipe completes a task every clock cycle. No matter how many
segments there are in the system, once the pipeline is full, it takes only one
clock period to obtain an output.

‘Now consider the case where ak-segment pipeline with aclock cycle time
1, is used to execute n tasks. The first task T; requires a time equal to kt, to
complete its operation since there are k segments in the pipe. The remaining
n~ 1 tasks emerge from the pipe at the rate of one task per clock cycle and
they will be completed after a time equal to (n ~ 1)f,. Therefore, to complete
ntasks using a k-segment pipelinerequiresk + (n — 1) clock cycles. For exam-
ple, the diagram of Fig. 9-4 shows four segments and six tasks. The time
required to complete all the operations is 4+ (6 — 1) = 9 dlock cycles, as
indicated in the diagram.

‘Next consider a nonpipeline unit that performs the same operation and
takesa time equal tof, to complete each task. The total time required for m tasks
is nt,. The speedup of a pipeline processing over an equivalent nonpipeline
processing is defined by the ratio
