Figure 9-7. Four-segment CPU pipeline.

Figure 98 shows the operation of theinstuctin pipeline Thetimein the
barizantal axis is divided into steps of equal duration. The four eegments are
represented in the diagram with an abbreviated eymbol.

1. Fiis the segment that fetches an instruction.

2. DA is the segment that decodes the instruction and calculates the
effective address.

3. FO is the segment that fetches the operand.
4. EX is the segment that executes the instruction,

Ttis assumed that the processor has separate instruction and data memories
60 thet the operation in Fl and FO can prowed at the same time. In the absence
