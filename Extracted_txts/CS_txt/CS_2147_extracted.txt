x = 1. The state following 11 is 00, which causes the count to be repeated. If
x = 0, the state of the circuit remains unchanged. This sequential circuit has
no external outputs, and therefore only the input value is labeled in the
diagram. Thestate of the flip-flops is considered as the outputs of the counter.

â€˜We have already assigned the symbol x to the input variable. We now
assign the symbols A and B to the two flip-flop outputs. The next state of A
and B, as a function of the present state and input x, can be transferred from
thestate diagramintoa state table. The first five columns of Table 1-5 constitute
the state table. The entries for this table are obtained directly from the state
diagram.

The excitation table of a sequential circuit is an extension ofthe state table.
This extension consists of a list of flip-flop input excitations that will cause the
