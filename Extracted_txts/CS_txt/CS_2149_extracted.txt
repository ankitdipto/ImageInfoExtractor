applications, the problems can be formulated in terms of vectors and matrice:
that lend themselves to vector processing.

‘Computers with vector processing capabilities are in demand in special
ized applications. The following are representative application areas when
vector processing is of the utmost importance.

Long-range weather forecasting

Petroleum explorations

Seismic data analysis

Medical diagnosis

Aerodynamics and space flight simulations
