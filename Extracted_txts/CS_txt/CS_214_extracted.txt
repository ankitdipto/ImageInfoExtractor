A solution to the equations (28.1) is a set of values for x,,X2,..., X, that satisfy

all of the equations simultaneously. In this section, we treat only the case in which
there are exactly 7 equations in n unknowns.
We can conveniently rewrite equations (28.1) as the matrix-vector equation

41 42 ++ Gin x bd
421 422 +++ Gan x2 by

or, equivalently, letting A = (a;;), x = (x;), and b = (b;), as

Ax=b. (28.2)
If A is nonsingular, it possesses an inverse A~!, and

x=Alb (28.3)

is the solution vector. We can prove that x is the unique solution to equation (28.2)
as follows. If there are two solutions, x and x’, then Ax = Ax’ = b and, letting J
denote an identity matrix,

x = Ix
= (41A)x
= A '(Ax)
= A!(Ax’)
= (AIA)x’
= x.

In this section, we shall be concerned predominantly with the case in which A
is nonsingular or, equivalently (by Theorem D.1), the rank of A is equal to the
number 1 of unknowns. There are other possibilities, however, which merit a brief
discussion. If the number of equations is less than the number 7 of unknowns—or,
more generally, if the rank of A is less than n—then the system is underdeter-
mined. An underdetermined system typically has infinitely many solutions, al-
though it may have no solutions at all if the equations are inconsistent. If the
number of equations exceeds the number 71 of unknowns, the system is overdeter-
mined, and there may not exist any solutions. Section 28.3 addresses the important
