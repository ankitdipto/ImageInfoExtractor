Without sophisticated computers, many of the required computations cannot
be completed withina reasonable amount of time. Toachieve the required level
of high performance it is necessary to utilize the fastest and most reliable
hardware and apply innovative procedures from vector and parallel processing
techniques.

Vector Operations

Many scientific problems require arithmetic operations on large arrays of
numbers, These numbers are usually formulated as vectors and matrices of
floating-point numbers, A vectoris an ordered set of a one-dimensional array
of data items. A vector V of length n is represented as a row vector by
V=[V, Vy Vy -++ Val-Itmaybe represented asa columnvector if the data
items are listed in a column. A conventional sequential computer is capable of
processing operands one ata time. Consequently, operations on vectors must
be broken down into single computations with subscripted variables. The
element V, of vector V is written as V(I) and the index I refers to a memory
address or register where the number is stored. To examine the difference
between a conventional scalar processor and a vector processor, consider the
following Fortran DO loop:

Do 201=1, 100
20 C(I) =B(I) + A(I)
This is a program for adding two vectors A and B of length 100 to produce a

vector C. This is implemented in machine language by the following sequence
of operations.

 

InitializeT
20 Read A(T)

Read B(I)

Store C(I) = A(I) + B(T)

Increment I=I+1

If I= 100 go to 20

Continue

a

This constitutes a program loop that reads a pair of operands from arrays A
and B and performs a floating-point addition. The loop control variable is then
updated and the steps repeat 100 times.
