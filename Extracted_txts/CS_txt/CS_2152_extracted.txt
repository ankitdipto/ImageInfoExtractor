SECTION 96 Vector Processing 323

This requires three multiplications and (after initializing c: to 0) three addi-
tions. The total number of multiplications oradditionsrequired tocompute the
matrixproductis9 x 3 = 27. Ifweconsider the linked multiply-add operation
¢ +a X basacumulative operation, the product of twon x nmatricesrequires
1 multiply-add operations. The computation consists of n? inner products,
with each inner product requiring » multiply-add operations, assuming that
is initialized to zero before computing each element in the product matrix.

In general, the inner product consists of the sum of k product terms of
the form

 

C = A,B, + AyBy + AyBy + AyBy +++ + ABe

Ina typical application k may be equal to 100 or even 1000. The inner product
calculation on a pipeline vector processor is shown in Fig. 9-12. The values of
A and B are either in memory or in processor registers. The floating-point
multiplier pipeline and the floating-point adder pipeline are assumed to have
four segments each. All segment registers in the multiplier and adder are
initialized to 0. Therefore, the output of the adder is 0 for the first eight cycles
until both pipes are full. A, and B, pairs are brought in and multiplied at a rate
ofone pair per cycle. After the first four cycles, the products begin to be added
to the output of the adder. During the next four cycles 0 is added to the
products entering the adder pipeline. At the end of the eighth cycle, the first
four products A,B, through A,B, are in the four adder segments, and the next
four products, AsBs through A,Bs, are in the multiplier segments. At the
beginning of the ninth cycle, the output of the adder is A, B, and the output
of the multiplier is As Bs. Thus the ninth cycle starts the addition A, By + AsBs
in the adder pipeline. The tenth cycle starts the addition 2B; + A,B, and so
on This pattern breaks down the summation into four sections as follows:

C= A,B, + AsBs + AsBy + ApBy ++°°
+ A,B, + AsBe + AroBro + AuBu +
+ A,B, + A,B, + AnBu + AisBs +
+ AyBy + AgBy + An Bp + AuBre +
