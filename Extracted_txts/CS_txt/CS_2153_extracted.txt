CHAPTER NINE. Pipeline and Vector Processing

When there are no more product terms to be added, the system inserts four
zeros into the multiplier pipeline. The adder pipeline will then have one partial
product in each of its four segments, corresponding to the four sums listed in
the four rows in the above equation. The four partial sums are then added to
form the final sum.

Memory Interleaving

Pipeline and vector processors often require simultaneous access to memory
from two or more sources. An instruction pipeline may require the fetching of
an instruction and an operand at thesame time from two different segments.
Similarly, an arithmetic pipeline usually requires two or more operands to
enter the pipeline at the same time. Instead of using two memory buses for
simultaneous access, the memory can be partitioned intoa number of modules
connected to a common memory address and data buses. A memory module
is amemory array togetherwith its own address and data registers. Figure 9-13
shows a memory unit with four modules. Each memory array has its own
address register AR and data register DR. The address registers receive infor-
mation from a common address bus and the data registers communicate with
bidirectional data bus. The two least significant bts of the address can be used
to distinguish between the four modules. The modular system permits one
module to initiate a memory access while other modules are in the process of
reading or writing a word and each module can honor a memory request
independent of the state of the other modules.
