directly executed within the master control unit. Vectorinstructions are broad-
cast to all PEs simultaneously. Each PE uses operands stored in its local
memory. Vector operands are distributed to the local memories prior to the
parallel execution of the instruction.

Consider, for example, the vector addition C = A + B. The master con-
trol unit first stores the ith components a, and b, of A and B in local memory
M, for i = 1,2,3,...,.n. It then broadcasts the floating-point add instruction
Â¢ =a, +b; toall PEs, causing the addition to take place simultaneously. The
components of c, are stored in fixed locations in each local memory. This
produces the desired vector sum in one add cycle.

Masking schemes are used to control the status of each PE during the
execution of vector instructions. Each PE has a flag that is set when the PE is
active and reset when the PEis inactive. This ensures that only those PEs that
need to participate are active during the execution of the instruction. For
example, suppose that the array processor containsa set of 64 PEs. If a vector
length of less than 64 data items is to be processed, the control unit selects the
proper number of PEs to be active. Vectors of greater length than 64 must be
divided into 64-word portions by the control unit.

The best known SIMD array processors the ILLIAC IV computer devel-
oped at the University of Llinois and manufactured by the Burroughs Corp.
This computer is no longer in operation. SIMD processors are highly special-
ized computers. They are suited primarily for numerical problems that can be
expressed in vector or matrix form. However, they are not very efficient in
other types of computations or in dealing with conventional data-processing
programs.
