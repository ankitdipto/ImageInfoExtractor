28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 8i5

problem of finding good approximate solutions to overdetermined systems of linear
equations.

Let us return to our problem of solving the system Ax = b of n equations inn
unknowns. We could compute Aq! and then, using equation (28.3), multiply >
by A, yielding x = A7'b. This approach suffers in practice from numerical
instability. Fortunately, another approach—LUP decomposition—is numerically
stable and has the further advantage of being faster in practice.

Overview of LUP decomposition

The idea behind LUP decomposition is to find three n x n matrices L, U, and P
such that

PA=LU, (28.4)
where

¢ Lisa unit lower-triangular matrix,
¢ U is an upper-triangular matrix, and

* Pisa permutation matrix.

We call matrices L, U, and P satisfying equation (28.4) an LUP decomposition
of the matrix A. We shall show that every nonsingular matrix A possesses such a
decomposition.

Computing an LUP decomposition for the matrix A has the advantage that we
can more easily solve linear systems when they are triangular, as is the case for
both matrices L and U. Once we have found an LUP decomposition for A, we
can solve equation (28.2), Ax = b, by solving only triangular linear systems, as
follows. Multiplying both sides of Ax = b by P yields the equivalent equation
PAx = Pb, which, by Exercise D.1-4, amounts to permuting the equations (28.1).
Using our decomposition (28.4), we obtain

LUx = Pb.

We can now solve this equation by solving two triangular linear systems. Let us
define y = Ux, where x is the desired solution vector. First, we solve the lower-
triangular system

Ly = Pb (28.5)

for the unknown vector y by a method called “forward substitution.” Having solved
for y, we then solve the upper-triangular system

Ux=y (28.6)
