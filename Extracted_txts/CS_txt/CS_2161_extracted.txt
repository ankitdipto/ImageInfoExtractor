‘Consider the four instructions in the folowing program. Suppose that the
first instruction starts fram step 1 in the pipeline used in Fig. +8. Specify
what operations are pecfarmes) in the fgur segments during step 4.

Load = Rb BL 912]
RD R2—R2 + B(343]
INC = -R3eR3 +1
STORE #(314]—-R3

Give an example of a program that will couse data conflict in the threeseg-

ment pipeline of Sec. 95.

Give an example that uses detayed load with the thre-segment pipeline of

Sec 95.

Give an exemple of a program that will cause a branch penalty in the

theve-segment pipeline of Sec. 5.

Give an example that uses delayed branch with the three-segment pipeline

of See. 9.5,

Considerthemultiplicationoftwod0 x mati cesusing avectorpemae.
How many product terms are there in each inner product, andhow many

inner pioducts must be evaluated?

b. Howmany mulkipty-add operations are needed to calaulote the product
atria?

How many dock pes does it take to process an inner product in the

Pipeline of Fig. 9-12 when used to evaluate the produ of two 60 x 60

matrices? How many inner products are there. and how many clock cytles

does it take to evaluate the product matrix?

‘Assign addresses to an array of dats of 1024 words to be elored in the

memory described in Fig, 9-13.

‘A weother forecasting computation requires 290 billion floating point oper

ations. The pioblem is proceasedin a supercomputer thatean pecarm 100

megailops. How long will it take to do these calculations?

Consider a computer with four Aoating-pairt pipeline processors Suppose

thateach processor usesa cycetimeol 40 ns, How long will ittahe to perform

400 floating-point operetions? Is there a difference f the same 400 operations

are cacried out usinga single pipeline proucasor witha cycte time af 10s?
