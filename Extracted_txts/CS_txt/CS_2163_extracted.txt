10-1 Introduction

Arithmetic instructions in digital computers manipulate data to produce re-
sults necessary for the solution of computational problems. These instructions
pevform arithmetic calculations and are responsible for the bulk of activity
involved in processing data in a computer. The fourbasie arithmetic operations
are addition, subtraction, multiptication, and division. From these four basic
operations, it is passible to formulate other arithmetic functions ana soive
scientific Problems by means of numeticat analysis methods.

â€˜An arithmetic processor is the part of a processor unit that executes
arithmetic operations, The data typeassumed to reside in processor cegisters
during the execution of an arithmetic instructionis specified in the definifion
of the instruction. An arithmetic instruction may specify binary or decimal
data, and in each case the data may be in fixed-point or loating-point form.
Fixed-point numbers may represent integers or fractions. Negative numbers
may bein signed-magnitude ar signed-complementrepresentation. The arith-
metic processor is very simple if only a binary fixed-point add instruction is
included, It would be mare complicated if it includes all four arithmetic a per-
