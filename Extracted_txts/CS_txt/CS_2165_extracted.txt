after the execution of the arithmetic operation It does not mean that comple-
ment arithmetic may not be used in an intermediate step. For example, it is
convenient to employ complement arithmetic when performing a subtraction
operation with numbers in signed-magnitude representation. As long as the
initial minuend and subtrahend, as well as the final difference, are in signed-
‘magnitude form the fact that complements have been used in an intermediate
step does not alter the fact that the representation is in signed-magnitude.

Addition and Subtraction with Signed-Magnitude Data

The representation of numbers in signed-magnitude is familiar because it is
used in everyday arithmeticcalculations. The procedure for adding or subtract-
ing two signed binary numbers with paper and pencil is simple and straight-
forward. A review of this procedure will be helpful for deriving the hardware
algorithm.

‘We designate the magnitude of the two numbers by A and B. When the
signed numbers are added or subtracted, we find that there are eight different
conditions to consider, depending on the sign of the numbers and the opera-
tion performed. These conditions are listed in the first column of Table 10-1.
‘Theother columns in the table show the actual operation to be performed with
the magnitude of the numbers. The last column is needed to prevent a negative
zero. In other words, when two equal numbers are subtracted, the result
should be +0 not -0.

The algorithms for addition and subtraction are derived from the table
and can be stated as follows (the words inside parentheses should be used for
the subtraction algorithm):

Addition (subtraction) algorithm: when the signs of A and B are identical
(different), add the two magnitudes and attach the sign of Ato the result. When
the signs of A and B are different (identical), compare the magnitudes and
