Addition and Subtraction with Signed-2’s

Complement Data

The signed-2’s complement representation of numbers together with arith-
‘metic algorithms for addition and subtraction are introduced in Sec. 3-3. They
are summarized here for easy reference. The leftmost bit of a binary number
represents the sign bit: 0 for positive and 1 for negative. If the sign bit is 1, the
entire number is represented in 2's complement form. Thus +33 is represented
