Figure 10-4 Algorithm for adding and subtracting numbers in signed-2s
complement representation.

Comparing this algorithm with its signed-magnitude counterpart, we
note that it is much simpler to add and subtract numbers if negative numbers
are maintained insigned-2’s complement representation. For this reason most
computersadopt thisrepresentation over the more familiar signed-magnitude.

10-3 Multiplication Algorithms

‘Multiplication of two fixed-pointbinary numbers in signed-magnitude repre-
sentation is done with paper and pencil by a process of successive shift and
add operations. This process is best illustrated with a numerical example.

The process consists of looking at successive bits of the multiplier, least signif-
icant bit first. If the multiplier bit is a 1, the multiplicand is copied down;
otherwise, zeros are copied down. The numbers copied down in successive
lines are shifted one position to the left from the previous number. Finally, the
numbers are added and their sum forms the product.
