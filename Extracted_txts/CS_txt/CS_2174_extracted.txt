least significant bit of A is shifted into the most significant position of Q, the
bit from Eis shifted into the most significant position of A, and Ois shifted into
E. After the shift, one bit of the partial product is shifted into Q, pushing the
multiplier bits one position to the right. In this manner, the rightmost flip-flop
in register Q, designated by Q,, will hold the bit of the multiplier, which must
be inspected next.

Hardware Algorithm

Figure 10-6 is a flowchart of the hardware multiply algorithm. Initially, the
multiplicand is in B and the multiplier in Q. Their corresponding signs are in
B, and Q,, respectively. The signs are compared, and both A and Q are set to
