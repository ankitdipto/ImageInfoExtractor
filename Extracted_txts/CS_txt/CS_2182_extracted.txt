partial remainder

SECTION 10-4 Division Algorithms 349

cause the quotient digits are either 0 or 1 and there is noneed to estimate how
many times the dividend or partial remainder fits into the divisor. The division
process is illustrated by a numerical example in Fig. 10-11. The divisor B
consists of five bits and the dividend A, of ten bits. The five most significant
bits of the dividend are compared with the divisor. Since the 5-bit number is
smaller than B, we try again by taking the sx most significant bits of A and
compare this number with B. The 6-bit number is greater than B, so we place
a 1 for the quotient bit in the sixth position above the dividend. The divisor is
then shifted onceto theright and subtracted fromthe dividend. The difference
is called a partial remainder because the division could have stopped here to
obtain a quotient of 1 and a remainder equal to the partial remainder. The
process is continued by comparing a partial remainder with the divisor. Ifthe
partial remainder is greater than or equal to the divisor, the quotient bit is equal
to 1. The divisoris then shifted right and subtracted from the partial remainder.
If the partial remainder is smaller than the divisor, the quotient bit is 0 and no
subtraction is needed. The divisors shifted once to the right in any case. Note
that the result gives both a quotient and a remainder.

 

Hardware Implementation for Signed-Magnitude Data

When the division is implemented in a digital computer, it is convenient to
change the process slightly. Instead of shifting the divisor to the right, the
dividend, or partial remainder, is shifted to the left, thus leaving the two
numbers in the required relative position. Subtraction may be achieved by
adding A to the 2's complement of B. The information about the relative
magnitudes is then available from the end-carry.

The hardware for implementing the division operation is identical to that
required for multiplication and consists of the components shown in Fig. 10-5.
Register EAQ is now shifted to the left with 0 inserted into Q, and the previous
value of E lost. The numerical example is repeated in Fig. 10-12 to clarify the
