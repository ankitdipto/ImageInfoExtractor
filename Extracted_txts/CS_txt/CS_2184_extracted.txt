proposed division process. The divisor is stored in the B register and the
double-length dividend is stored in registers A and Q. The dividend is shifted
totheleft and the divisor is subtracted by adding its 2’s complement value. The
information about the relative magnitude is availablein E. If E = 1, it signifies
that A = B. A quotient bit 1 is inserted into Q, and the partial remainder is
shifted to the left to repeat the process. If E = 0, it signifies that A < B so the
quotient in Q, remains a 0 (inserted during the shift). The value of B is then
added to restore the partial remainder in A to its previous value. The partial
remainder is shifted to the left and the process is repeated again until all five
quotient bits are formed. Note that while the partial remainder is shifted left,
the quotient bits are shifted also and after five shifts, the quotient is in Q and
the final remainder is in A.

Before showing the algorithm in flowchart form, we have to consider the
sign of the result and a possible overflow condition. The sign of the quotient
is determined from the signs of the dividend and the divisor. If the two signs
