Hardware Algorithm

The hardware divide algorithm is shown in the flowchart of Fig. 10-13. The
dividend is in A and Qand the divisor in B. The sign of the result is transferred
into Q, to be part of the quotient. A constant is set into the sequence counter
SC to specify the number of bits in the quotient As in multiplication, we
assume that operands are transferred to registers froma memory unit that has
