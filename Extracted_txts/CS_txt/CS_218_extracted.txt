Chapter 28 Matrix Operations

Procedure LUP-SOLVE solves for y using forward substitution in lines 3-4, and
then it solves for x using backward substitution in lines 5—6. Since the summation
within each of the for loops includes an implicit loop, the running time is O(n).

As an example of these methods, consider the system of linear equations defined
by

and we wish to solve for the unknown x. The LUP decomposition is

(You might want to verify that PA = LU.) Using forward substitution, we solve

by computing first y;, then y>, and finally y3. Using back substitution, we solve
Ux = y for x:
