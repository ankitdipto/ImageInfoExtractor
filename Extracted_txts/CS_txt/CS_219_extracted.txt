Figure 5-7 Example of control timing signals.

The last three waveforms in Fig. 5-7 show how SC is cleared when
DsT= 1. Output D, from the operation decoder becomes active at the end of
timing signal T,. When timingsignalT becomes active, the output of the AND
gate that implements the control function DsT, becomes active. This signal is
applied to the CLR input of SC. On the next positive clock transition (the one
marked 7; in the diagram) the counter is cleared to 0. This causes the timing
signal T, to become active instead of T; that would have been active if SC were
incremented instead of cleared.

‘A memory read or write cycle will be initiated with the rising edge of a
‘timing signal. It will be assumed that a memory cycle time is less than the clock
cycle time According to this assumption, a memory read or write cycle ini-
tiated by a timing signal will be completed by the time the next clock goes
through its positive transition. The clock transition will then be used to load
the memory word into a register. This timing relationship is not valid in many
computers because the memory cycle timeis usually longer than the processor
dlockeycle. In sucha caseit is necessary to provide wait cycles in the processor
