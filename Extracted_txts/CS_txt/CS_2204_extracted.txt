or Z; must have a 1. The condition for a correction and an output-carry can be
expressed by the Boolean function

C=K+ ZZ + ZZ,

When C = 1, it is necessary to add 0110 to the binary sum and provide an
output-carry for the next stage.

ABCD adder is a circuit that adds two BCD digitsin parallel and produces
a sum digit also in BCD. A BCD adder must include the correction logic in its
internal construction. To add 0110 to the binary sum, we use a second 4-bit
binary adder as shown in Fig. 10-18. The two decimal digits, together with the
input-carry, are first added in the top 4-bit binary adder to produce the binary
sum. When the output-carry is equal to 0, nothing is added tothe binary sum.
When it is equal to 1, binary 0110 is added to the binary sum through the
bottom4-bitbinary adder. The output-carry generated from the bottom binary
adder may be ignored, since it supplies information already available in the
output-carry terminal.
