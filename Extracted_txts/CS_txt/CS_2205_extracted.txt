A decimal parallel-adder that adds n decimal digits needs n BCD adder
stages with the output-carry from one stage connected to the input-carry of the
next-higher-order stage. To achieve shorter propagation delays, BCD adders
include the necessary circuits for carry look-ahead. Furthermore, the adder
circuit for the correction does not need all four full-adders, and this circuit can
be optimized.

BCD Subtraction

A straight subtraction of two decimal numbers will require a subtractor circuit
that will be somewhat different from a BCD adder. It is more economical to
perform the subtraction by taking the 9's or 10’s complement of the subtrahend
and adding it to the minuend. Since the BCD is nota self-complementing code,
the 9’s complement cannot be obtained by complementing each bit in the code.
It must be formed by a circuit that subtracts each BCD digit from 9.

The 9s complement of a decimal digit represented in BCD may be ob-
tained by complementing the bits in the coded representation of the digit
provided a correction is included. There are two possible correction methods.
In the first method, binary 1010 (decimal 10) is added to each complemented
digit and the carry discarded after each addition. In the second method, binary
0110 (decimal 6) is added before the digit is complemented. As a numerical
illustration, the 9’s complement of BCD 0111 (decimal 7) is computed by first
complementing each bit to obtain 1000. Adding binary 1010 and discarding the
carry, we obtain 0010 (decimal 2). By the second method, we add 0110 to 0111
toobtain 1101. Complementing each bit, we obtain the required result of 0010.
Complementing each bit of a 4-bit binary number N is identical to the subtrac-
tion of the number from 1111 (decimal 15). Adding the binary equivalent of
decimal 10 gives 15 - N + 10 = 9 ~ N + 16. But 16 signifies the carry that is
discarded, so the result is 9 - Nas required. Adding the binary equivalent of
decimal 6 and then complementing gives 15 ~ (N + 6) = 9 ~ N as required.

The 9s complement of a BCD digit can also be obtained through a
combinational circuit. When this circuit is attached to a BCD adder, the result
is a BCD adder/subtractor. Let the subtrahend (or addend) digit be denoted by
the four binary variables Bs, By Bz, and By. Let M be a mode bit that controls
the add/subtract operation. When M = 0, the two digits are added; when
M = 1, the digits are subtracted. Let the binary variables xs, x, x2, and x: be
the outputs of the 9’s complementer circuit. By an examination of the truth
table for the circuit, it may be observed (see Prob. 10-30) that By should always
be complemented; B, is always the same in the 9’s complement asin the original
digit; x is 1 when the exclusive-OR of B, and By is 1; and xs is 1 when
Bs B,B; = 000. The Boolean functions for the 9’s complementer circuit are
