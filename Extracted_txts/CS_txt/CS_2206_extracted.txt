B,M’ + (BiB, + ByB)M
44 = BeM’ + Bi BiBiM

 

From these equations we see that x = B when M = 0. When M = 1, the x
outputs produce the %s complement of B.

(One stage ofa decimal arithmetic unit that can add orsubtract two BCD
digits is shownin Fig. 10-19. It consists of aBCD adder and as complementer.
‘The mode Mcontrols the operation ofthe unit WithM = 0, the S outputs form
the sum of A and B. With M = 1, the S outputs form the sum of A plus the
9’scomplement of B. For numbers with n decimal digits we need n such stages.
The output carry C,,. from one stage must be connected to the input carry C,
of the next-higher-order stage. The best way to subtract the two decimal
numbers is to let M = 1 and apply a 1 to the input carry C; of the first stage.
The outputs will form the sum of A plus the 10's complement of B, which
is equivalent to a subtraction operation if the carry-out of the last stage is
discarded.

The algorithms for arithmetic operations with decimal data are similar to the
algorithms for the corresponding operations with binary data In fact, except
fora slight modification in the multiplication and division algorithms, the same
