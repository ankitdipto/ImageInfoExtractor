Using Table 1-2, derive the Boolean expression for the $ (sum) output of the
full-adder in sum-of-products form. Then by algebraic manipulation show
that S can be expressed as the exclusive-OR of the three input variables.

‘A majority function is generated in a combinational circuit when the output
is equal to 1 if the input variables have more 1's than ('s. The output is 0
otherwise. Design a three-input majority function.

Design a combinational circuit with three inputs x, y, z and three outputs
‘A, B, C. When thebinary inputis 0, 1, 2, or3, the binary outputis one greater
than the input. When the binary input is 4 5, 6, or 7, the binary output is
cone less than the input.

Show that a JK flip-flop can be converted to a D flip-flop with an inverter
between the J and K inputs.

Using the information from the characteristic table of the JK flip-flop listed
in Fig. 1-21(b), derive the excitation table for the JK flip-flop and compare
your answer with Table 1-3.

‘A sequential circuit has two D flip-flops A and B, two inputs x and y, and
one output z. The flip-flop input equations and the circuit output are as
follows.

'y +A
