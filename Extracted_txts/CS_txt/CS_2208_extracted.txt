CHAPTER TEN Computer Arithmetic

flowcharts can be used for both types of data provided that we interpret the
microoperation symbols properly. Decimal numbers in BCD are stored in
computer registers in groups of four bits. Each 4-bit group represents a decimal
digit and must be taken as a unit when performing decimal microoperations.

For convenience, we will use the same symbols for binary and decimal
arithmetic microoperations but give them a different interpretation. Asshown
in Table 10-5, a bar over the register letter symbol denotes the 9’s complement
of the decimal number stored in the register. Adding 1 to the 9’s complement
Produces the 10's complement. Thus, for decimal numbers, the symbol
AA +B + 1 denotes a transfer of the decimal sum formed by adding the
original content A to the 10's complement of B. The use of identical symbols
for the 9's complement and the 1’s complement may be confusing if both types
of data are employed in the same system. If this is the case, it may be better
to adopt a different symbol for the 9’s complement. If only one type of data
is being considered, the symbol would apply to the type of data used.

Incrementing or decrementing a register is the same for binary and
decimal except for the number of states that the registeris allowed to have. A
binary counter goes through 16 states, from 0000 to 1111, when incremented.
‘A decimal counter goes through 10 states from 0000 to 1001 and back to 0000,
since 9 is the last count. Similarly, a binary counter sequences from 1111 to 0000
when decremented. A decimal counter goes from 1001 to 0000.

A decimal shift right or left is preceded by the letter d to indicate a shift
over the four bits that hold the decimal digits. As a numerical illustration
consider a register A holding decimal 7860 in BCD. The bit pattern of the 12
flip-flops is

0111 1000 o110 0000

‘The microoperation dshr A shifts the decimal number one digit to the right to
give 0786. This shift is over the four bitsand changes the content of the register
into

0000 0111 1000 0110
