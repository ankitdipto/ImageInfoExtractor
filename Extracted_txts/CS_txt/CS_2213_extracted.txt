Division
Decimal divisionis similar tobinary division except of course that the quotient
digits may have any of the 10 values from 0 to 9. In the restoring division
method, the divisor is subtracted from the dividend or partial remainder as
many times as necessary until a negative remainder results. The correct re-
mainder is then restored by adding the divisor. The digitin the quotientreflects
the number of subtractions up to but excluding the one that caused the
negative difference.
The decimal division algorithm is shown in Fig. 10-23. It is similar to the
algorithm with binary data except for the way the quotient bits are formed. The
dividend (or partial remainder) is shifted to the left, with its most significant
digit placed in A,. The divisor is then subtracted by adding its 10â€™s complement
value. Since B, is initially cleared, its complement value is 9 as required. The
carry in E determines the relative magnitude of A and B. If E = 0, it signifies
