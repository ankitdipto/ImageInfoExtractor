that A < B. In this case the divisor is added to restore the partial remainder
and Q, stays at 0 (inserted there during the shift). If E = 1, it signifies that
A = B. The quotient digit in Q, is incremented once and the divisor subtracted
again. This process is repeated until the subtraction results in a negative
difference which is recognized by E being 0. When this occurs, the quotient
digit isnot incremented but the divisor is added to restore the positive remain-
der. In this way, the quotient digit is made equal to the number of times that
the partial remainder “goes” into the divisor.
