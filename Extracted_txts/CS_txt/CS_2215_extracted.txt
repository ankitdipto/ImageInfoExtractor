HASTER TEN Computer Arithmetic

The partial cemainder and the quotien bits are chifted once to the feftand

the process is repeated k times to form quotient digits. The cemainderis then
found in register A and the quotientisin cegisterQ. The value of E is neglected.

Floating-Point Operations

Decimal floating-point arithmetic operations follow the same procedures as
binary operations. The algorithms in Sec. 10-5 can be adopted for decimal data
provided that the microoperatien symbols are interpreted currectly. The otal-
tiplication and division of the manticsas must be done bythe methods de-
sctibed above.

Perform the arithmetic operations below with binary numbers and with
negative numbers In signed.2's complement representation, Use seven bits
toascommodate each number together with its sign. In eachcase, determine
if there is an averfiow by checking the curtes into and out of the sign bit
position.

Consider the binary numbers when they are in signed 2 complement
representation, Each ruumber has 1 bits: one for the sign and k =m - 1 for
the magnitude. A negative cumnber —X is represented as 2 + (2— X)
where the first 2 designates the sign bitand (2° ~ X)is the 2 scamplement
OfX. A positive number is represented as + X, where the Odesignates the
signbit and X, theb-bit augnitude, Using these gereralized eymbals, grove
