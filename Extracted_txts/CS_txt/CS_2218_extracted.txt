sion. Let the number o bits in the magnitude part ofthe mantissa be (n ~ 1).

For integer representation:

‘a. Show that if single-precision product is used, (n ~ 1) must be added
to the exponent product in the AC.

'b. Show that if a single-precision mantissa dividend is used, (n ~ 1) must
bbe subtracted from the exponent dividend when Q is cleared

Show the hardware to be used for the addition and subtraction of two

decimal numbers in signed-magnitude representation. Indicate how an

overflow is detected.

‘Show that 673 ~ 356 can be computed by adding 673to the 10’s complement

(0f356 and discarding the end carry. Draw the block diagram ofa three-stage

decimal arithmetic unit and show how this operation is implemented. List

all input bits and output bits of the unit

Show that the lower 4-bit binary adder in Fig. 10-1 can be replaced by one

fulkadder and two half-adders.

Using combinational circuit design techniques, derive the Boolean functions

for the BCD 9s complementer of Fig. 10-19. Draw the logic diagram.

It isnecessary to design an adder for two decimal digits represented in the

excess-3 code (Table 3-6). Show that the correction after adding two digits

with a bit binary adder is as follows:

a. The output carry is equal to the uncorrected carry.

b. If output carry = 1, add 0011.

¢. If output carry = 0, add 1101 and ignore the carry from this addition.
Show that the excess-3 adder can be constructed with seven full-adders
and two inverters.

Derive the circuit for a 9's complementer when decimal digits are repre-

sented in the excess-3 code (Table 3-6). A mode control input determines

whether the digit is complemented or not. What is the advantage of using

this code over BCD?

Show the hardware to be used for the addition and subtraction of two

decimal numbers with negative numbers in signed-10's complement repre-

sentation. Indicate how an overflow is detected. Derive the flowchart ak

gorithm and try a few numbers to convince yourself that the algorithm

Produces correct results.

Show the content of registers A, B, Q, and SC during the decimal multiplt-
cation (Fig. 10-22) of (a) 470 x 152 and (b) 999 x 199. Assume three-digit
registers and take the second number as the multiplier.

Show the content of registers A, E, Q, and SC during the decimal division
(Fig. 10-23) of 1680/32. Assume two-digit registers.

Show that subregister A, in Fig. 10-21 is zero at the termination of (a) the
decimal multiplication as specified in Fig. 10-22, and (b) the decimal division
as specified in Fig. 10-23.

Change the floating-point arithmetic algorithms in Sec. 10-5 from binary to
decimal data. In a table, list how each microoperation symbol should be
interpreted.
