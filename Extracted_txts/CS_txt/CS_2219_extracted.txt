SECTION 1.7 Sequential Crevits 39

a. Draw the logic diagrom of the circuit.
b. Tabulate the state table.

1-20. Design a 2-bit countdown counter. This is a sequential circuit with two
{flip-flops and one input x. When x = 0, the state of the Gip-flops does not
change. When x = 1, the alate sequence is 11, 10, 01, 00, 11, and repeat.

1.21 Design a sequential creuit with two IK flip-figps A and B and two inputs E
and r. IE = 0, the circuit remains in the same state reyardless of the vane
efx. When E = 1 and x = 1, the circuit goes through the state transitions

  

from 00 to.01 10 10 to 11 back to 00, and repeat. When E = Vand x = 0. the
circuit goes through We state transitions from D0to 11 Â£010 to 01 baak ko 00,
and repeat
