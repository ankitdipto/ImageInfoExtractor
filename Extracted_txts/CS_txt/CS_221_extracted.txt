The Os in the first and second matrices of equation (28.8) are row and col-
umn (n —1)-vectors, respectively. The term vw'/ai1, formed by taking the
outer product of v and w and dividing each element of the result by a1, is an
(n — 1) x (n — 1) matrix, which conforms in size to the matrix A’ from which it is
subtracted. The resulting (n — 1) x (m — 1) matrix

A’—vw'/ay (28.9)
is called the Schur complement of A with respect to a1.

We claim that if A is nonsingular, then the Schur complement is nonsingular,
too. Why? Suppose that the Schur complement, which is ( — 1) x (n — 1), is
singular. Then by Theorem D.1, it has row rank strictly less than n — 1. Because
the bottom 7 — | entries in the first column of the matrix

ay wr
0 A -vuT/ay

are all 0, the bottom  — | rows of this matrix must have row rank strictly less
than 2 — 1. The row rank of the entire matrix, therefore, is strictly less than n.
Applying Exercise D.2-8 to equation (28.8), A has rank strictly less than n, and
from Theorem D.1 we derive the contradiction that A is singular.

Because the Schur complement is nonsingular, we can now recursively find an
LU decomposition for it. Let us say that

A'—vw'/ay, =L'U',~

where L’ is unit lower-triangular and U’ is upper-triangular. Then, using matrix
algebra, we have

A= 1 0 au wt
~ V/ayy Tn 0 A vwT/ay
1 0 ay, wt

via Ina )\ 0 LIU’

_ 1 0 ay wt

~~ v/ay L' 0 U'

= LU,

A

thereby providing our LU decomposition. (Note that because L’ is unit lower-
triangular, so is L, and because U’ is upper-triangular, so is U.)
