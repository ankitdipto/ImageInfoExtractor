The input-output subsystem of a computer, referred toas UO, eruvides an
efficient mode of communication between the centzal system and the outside
environment, Programs and data must be entered into computer memory for

ing and results obtained from computations must be recorded or dis-
played for the user. A computer serves no useful purpase without the ability
to receive information from an outside source and to transmit resuits in a
meaningful form.

The most familiar means of entering information into a computer is
through a typewriter-like keyboard thatallows a person to enter alphanumeric
information directly. Every timea key is depressed, the termina) sendsa binary
coded character to the computer. The fastest possible speed for entering
information this way depends on the person's typing speed. On the other
hand, the central pmcessing unit is an extremely fast device capable of per-
forming operations at very high speed. When input informationis transferred
tothe processor viaa slow keyboard, the processor will be idle mostofthetime
while waiting for the information to arrive. To use a computer efficiently, a
