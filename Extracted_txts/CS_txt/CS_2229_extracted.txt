In addition, each device may have its own controller that supervises the
operations of the particular mechanism in the peripheral.

VO Bus and Interface Modules

A typical communication link between the procewor and several peripherals
is shown in Fig, 11-1. The UO bus consists of data lines, address lines, and
control lines. The magnetic disk, ptinter, and terminal are employed in prac-
tically any general-purpose computer. The magnetic tape is used in some
computers for backup storage. Each peripheral device has asvociated with it
an interface unit. Eachinterfare decedes the address and control ceceived from
the UO bus, interprets them for the peripheral, and provides signals for the
peripheral controller. It also synchronizes the data How and supervises the
transfer between peripheral and peonessor. Each peripheral has its own con-
troller that operates the partiailar efectromechanical device. For example. the
printer controller eantrok the paper motion, the print timing, and the selection
of printing characters. A controller may be housed separately or may be
physically integrated with the peripheral.

The Obus from the processor is attached 10 all peripheral interfaces. To
comununicate with a particular device, the processor places a device address
on the address lines. Each interface attached to the /O bus containsanaddress
decoder that monitors the addiess lines. When the interface detects its own
address, it activates the path between the bus lines and the device that it
controls, All peripherals whose address does not correspond to the address in
the bus are disabled by their interface.

At the same time that the address is made available in the address lines,
the processor provides a function code in the control lines. The interface
