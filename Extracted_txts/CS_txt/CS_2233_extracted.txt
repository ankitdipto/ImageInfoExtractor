2-1 _ Integrated Circuits

Digital circuits are constructed with integrated circuite. An integrated circuit
{abbreviated IC) is a small silicon semiconductor crystal, called a chip, contain-
ing the electronic components for the digital gates. The various gates are
interconnected inside the chip toformthe required circuit. Thechip ismounted
ina ceramic oF plastic container, and connections are welded by thin gold wires
to external pins to form the integrated circuit. The number of pins may range
from 14 in a small IC package to 100 or mare in a larger package. Each IC has
a numeric designation printed on the suiface of the package for identification.
Each vendor publishes a data book or catalogtthat contains the exact descrip-
tion and all the necessary information about the ICs that it manufactures,

As the technology of ICs has improved, the number of gates that can be
putin a single chip has increased considerably. The differentiation between
those chips that have a few internal gates and those having hundreds or
thousands of gates is made by a customary reference to a package as being
either a small-, medium-, or large-scale integration device.

‘Small-soale integration (S81) devices contain several independent gates in
a single package. The inputs and outputs of the gates are connected directly
