the forward direction. The bits in the status register are used for status condi-
tions and for recording errors that may occur during the data transfer. For
example, astatus bit may indicate that port A has received a new data item from
theI/O device. Another bit in the status register may indicate that a parity error
has occurred during the transfer.

The interface registers communicate with the CPU through the bidirec-
tional data bus. The address bus selects the interface unit through the chip
select and the two register select inputs. A circuit must be provided externally
(usually, a decoder) to detect the address assigned to the interface registers.
This circuit enables the chip select (CS) input when the interface is selected by
the address bus. The two register select inputs RS1 and RSO are usually
connected to the two leastsignificant lines of the address bus. These two inputs
