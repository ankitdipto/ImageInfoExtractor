be at any given time The source unit initiates the transfer by placing the data
on the bus and enabling its data valid signal. The data accepted signal is activated
by the destination unit after it accepts the data from the bus. The source unit
then disables its data valid signal, which invalidates the data on the bus. The
destination unit then disables its data accepted signal and the system goes into
its initial state. The source does not send the next data item until after the
destination unit shows its readiness to accept new data by disabling its data
accepted signal. This scheme allows arbitrary delays from one state to the next
