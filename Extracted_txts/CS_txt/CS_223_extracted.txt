Figure 28.1 The operation of LU-DECOMPOSITION. (a) The matrix A. (b) The element a}; = 2
in the black circle is the pivot, the shaded column is v/a 11, and the shaded row is w'. The elements
of U computed thus far are above the horizontal line, and the elements of L are to the left of the
vertical line. The Schur complement matrix A’ — vwT/ay1 occupies the lower right. (c) We now
operate on the Schur complement matrix produced from part (b). The element a22 = 4 in the black
circle is the pivot, and the shaded column and row are v/a and wT (in the partitioning of the Schur
complement), respectively. Lines divide the matrix into the elements of U computed so far (above),
the elements of L computed so far (left), and the new Schur complement (lower right). (d) After the
next step, the matrix A is factored. (The element 3 in the new Schur complement becomes part of U
when the recursion terminates.) (e) The factorization A = LU.

trix A. (We don’t need to divide by a; in line 12 because we already did so when
we computed /;; in line 8.) Because line 12 is triply nested, LU-DECOMPOSITION
runs in time (71).

Figure 28.1 illustrates the operation of LU-DECOMPOSITION. It shows a stan-
dard optimization of the procedure in which we store the significant elements of L
and U in place in the matrix A. That is, we can set up a correspondence between
each element aj; and either /;; (if i > j) or ui; (if i < j) and update the ma-
trix A so that it holds both L and U when the procedure terminates. To obtain
the pseudocode for this optimization from the above pseudocode, just replace each
reference to / or u by a; you can easily verify that this transformation preserves
correctness.

Computing an LUP decomposition

Generally, in solving a system of linear equations Ax = b, we must pivot on off-
diagonal elements of A to avoid dividing by 0. Dividing by 0 would, of course,
be disastrous. But we also want to avoid dividing by a small value—even if A is
