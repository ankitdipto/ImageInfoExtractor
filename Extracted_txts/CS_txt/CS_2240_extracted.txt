SECTION 11-3 Asynchronous Data Tranfer 395,

and permits each unit to respond at its own data transfer rate. The rate of
transfer is determined by the slowest unit.

The destination-initiated transfer using handshaking lines is shown in
Fig, 11-6. Note that the name of the signal generated by the destination unit
has been changed to ready for data to reflect its new meaning. The source unit
in this case does not place data on the bus until after it receives the ready for
data signal from the destination unit. From there on, the handshaking proce-
dure follows the same pattern as in the source-initiated case. Note that the
