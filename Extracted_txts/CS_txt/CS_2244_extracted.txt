used to indicate whether the transmitter register is empty and another bit is
used to indicate whether the receiver register is full.

The operation of the transmitter portion of the interface is as follows. The
CPU reads the status register and checks the flag to see if the transmitter
register is empty. Ifitis empty, the CPU transfers a character to the transmitter
register and the interface clears the flag to mark the register full. The first bit
in the transmitter shift register is set to 0 to generate a start bit. The character
is transferred in parallel from the transmitter register to the shift register and
the appropriate number of stop bits are appended into the shift register. The
transmitterregisteris then marked empty. The character can now be transmit-
ted one bit at a time by shifting the data in the shift register at the specified
