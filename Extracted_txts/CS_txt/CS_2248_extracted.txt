flip-flops F, i = 1,2, 3,4, one for each register. The FIFO can store four words
of four bits each. The number of bits per word can be increased by increasing
the number of bits in each register and the number of words can be increased
by increasing the number of registers.

A flip-flop Fiin the control register that is set to 1indicates that a 4-bit data
word is stored in the corresponding register RI. A 0 in F; indicates that the
corresponding register does not contain valid data. The control register directs
