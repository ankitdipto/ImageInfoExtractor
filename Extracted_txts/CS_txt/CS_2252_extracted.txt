Chap. 6 is listed in Table 6-21.

The programmed /O method is particularly useful in small low-speed
computers or in systems that are dedicated to monitor a device continuously.
The difference in information transfer rate between the CPU and the /Odevice
makes this type of transfer inefficient. To see why this is inefficient, consider
a typical computer that can execute the two instructions that read the status
register and check the flag in 1 ys. Assume that the input device transfers its
