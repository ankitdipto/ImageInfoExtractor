by placing a 1 in its PO output. Thus the device with PI = 1 and PO = is the
one with the highest priority that is requesting an interrupt, and this device
places its VAD on the data bus. The daisy chain arrangement gives the highest,
Priority to the device that receives the interrupt acknowledge signal from the
CPU. The farther the device is from the first position, the lower is its priority.

Figure 11-13 shows the internal logic that must be included within each
device when connected in the daisy-chaining scheme. The device sets its RF
{flip-flop whenit wants to interrupt the CPU. The output of the RF flip-flop goes
through an open-collector inverter, a circuit that provides the wired logic for
the common interrupt line. If PI = 0, both PO and the enable line to VAD are
equal to 0, irrespective of the value of RF. If PI = 1 and RF = 0, then PO = 1
and the vector address is disabled. This condition passes the acknowledge
signal to the next device through PO. The device is active when PI = 1 and
RF = 1. This condition places a 0 in PO and enables the vector address for the
data bus. It is assumed that each device has its own distinct vector address.
The RF flip-flop is reset after a sufficient delay to ensure that the CPU has
received the vector address.

Parallel Priority Interrupt
The parallel priority interrupt method uses a register whose bits are set sepa-
rately by the interrupt signal from each device. Priority is established aceording
to the position of the bits in the register. In addition to the interrupt register,
the circuit may include a mask register whose purpose is to control the status
of each interrupt request. The mask register can be programmed to disable
