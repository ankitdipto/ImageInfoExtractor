SECTION 115 Priority Interupt 413

INTACK<1 Enable interrupt acknowledge
PC«<VAD Transfer vector address to PC
IEN<0 Disable further interrupts

Go to fetch next instruction

The CPU pushes the return address from PC into the stack. It then acknow!-
edges the interrupt by enabling the INTACK line. The priority interrupt unit
responds by placing a unique interrupt vector into the CPU data bus. The CPU
transfers the vector address into PC and clears JEN prior to going to the next
fetch phase. The instruction read from memory during the next fetch phase will
be the one located at the vector address.

Software Routines

A priority interrupt system is a combination of hardware and software tech-
niques. So far we have discussed the hardware aspects of a priority interrupt
system. The computer must also have software routines for servicing the
interrupt requests and for controlling the interrupt hardware registers.
Figure 11-15 shows the programs that must reside in memory for handling the
