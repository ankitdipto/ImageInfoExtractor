CPU-1OP Communication
‘The communication between CPU and IOP may takedifferent forms, depend-
ing on the particular computer considered. In most cases the memory unit acts
as a message center where each processor leaves information for the other. To
appreciate the operation of a typical IOP, we willillustrate by a specific example
the method by which the CPU and IOP communicate. This is a simplified
example that omits many operating details in order to provide an overview of
basic concepts.

The sequence of operations may be carried out as shown in the flowchart
of Fig. 11-20. The CPU sends an instruction to test the IOP path The IOP
