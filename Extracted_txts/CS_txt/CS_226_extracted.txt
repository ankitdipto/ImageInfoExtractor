nonsingular—because numerical instabilities can result. We therefore try to pivot
on a large value.

The mathematics behind LUP decomposition is similar to that of LU decom-
position. Recall that we are given ann x 1 nonsingular matrix A, and we wish
to find a permutation matrix P, a unit lower-triangular matrix L, and an upper-
triangular matrix U such that PA = LU. Before we partition the matrix A, as we
did for LU decomposition, we move a nonzero element, say dg1, from somewhere
in the first column to the (1, 1) position of the matrix. For numerical stability, we
choose ax; as the element in the first column with the greatest absolute value. (The
first column cannot contain only Os, for then A would be singular, because its de-
terminant would be 0, by Theorems D.4 and D.5.) In order to preserve the set of
equations, we exchange row | with row k, which is equivalent to multiplying A by
a permutation matrix Q on the left (Exercise D.1-4). Thus, we can write QA as

T
dy Ww
A= |e
2 ( v A )
where v = (d21,d31,...,dm)", except that a1, replaces agi; WT = (dx2,dk3,
+++, kn); and A’ is an (n—1) x(n—1) matrix. Since ag; 4 0, we can now perform

much the same linear algebra as for LU decomposition, but now guaranteeing that
we do not divide by 0:

As we saw for LU decomposition, if A is nonsingular, then the Schur comple-
ment A’ — vw/ag, is nonsingular, too. Therefore, we can recursively find an
LUP decomposition for it, with unit lower-triangular matrix L’, upper-triangular
matrix U’, and permutation matrix P’, such that
P'(A'— vw" /ag,) = L'U'.

which is a permutation matrix, since it is the product of two permutation matrices
(Exercise D.1-4). We now have
