representing one of the combinations of the three binary input variables. The
three inverters provide the complement of the inputs, and each of the eight
AND gates generates one of the binary combination. A particular application
of this decoder is a binary-to-octal conversion. The input variables represent
a binary number and the outputs represent the eight digits of the octal number
system. However, a3-to-8-line decoder can be used for decoding any 3-bit code
to provide eight outputs, one for each combination of the binary code.
Commercial decoders include one or more enable inputs to control the
operation of the circuit. The decoder of Fig. 2-1 has one enable input, E. The
decoder is enabled when E is equal to 1 and disabled when E is equal to 0.
The operation of the decoder can be clarified using the truth table listed
in Table 2-1. When the enable input E is equal to 0, all the outputs are equal
to 0 regardless of the values of the other three data inputs. The three x's in
the table designate don't-care conditions. When the enable input is equal to
1, the decoder operates in a normal fashion. For each possible input combina-
tion, there are seven outputs that are equal to 0 and only one that is equal to
1. The output variable whose value is equal to 1 represents the octal number
equivalent of the binary number that is available in the input data lines.
