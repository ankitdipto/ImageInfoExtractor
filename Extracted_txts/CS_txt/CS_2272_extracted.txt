receives one of these two instructions, it refers to memory location 72 for the
address of the first channel command word (CCW). The format of the channel
command word is shown in Fig. 11-21(0). The data address field specifies the
first address of a memory buffer and the count field gives the number of bytes
involved in the transfer. The command field specifies an /O operation and the
flag bits provide additional information for the channel. The command field
corresponds to an operation code that specifies one of six basic types of /O
operations:

1. Write. Transfer data from memory to VO device

2. Read. Transfer data from V/O device to memory.

3. Read backwards. Read magnetic tape with tape moving backward.

4. Control. Used to initiate an operation notinvolving transferof data, such
as rewinding of tape or positioning a disk-access mechanism.

5. Sense. Informs the channel to transfer its channel status word to
memory location 64.

6. Transfer in channel. Used instead of a jump instruction. Here the data
address field specifies the address of the next command word to be
executed by the channel.

‘An example of a channel program is shown in Table 11-3. It consists of
three command words. The first causes a transfer into a magnetic tape of 60
bytes from memory starting at address 4000. The next two command words
perform a similar function with a different portion of memory and byte count.
The six flags in each control word specify certain interrelations between the
command words The first flag is set to 1 in the first command word to specify
“data chaining.” It results in combining the 60 bytes from the first command
word with the 20 bytes of its successor into one record of 80 bytes. The 80 bytes
are written on tape without any separation or gaps even though two memory
sections were used. The second flag is set to 1 in the second command word
tospecify “command chaining.” It informs the channel that the next command
word will use the same I/O device, in this case, the tape. The channel informs
the tape unit to start inserting a record gap on the tape and proceeds to read
the next command word from memory. The 40 bytes of the third command
