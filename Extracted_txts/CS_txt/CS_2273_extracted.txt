word are then writtenon tape as aseparate record. When all the flags are equal
to zero, it signifies the end of UO operations for the particular /O device.
A memory map showing all pertinent information for /O processing is
illustrated in Fig, 11-22. The operation begins when the CPU program encoun-
tersa start /O instruction. The IOP then goes to memory location 72 to obtain
a channel address word. This word contains the starting address of the JO
channel program. The channel then proceeds to execute the program specified
by the channel command words. The channel constructs a status word during
