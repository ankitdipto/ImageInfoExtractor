information. The purpose of a data link protocol is to establish and terminate
a connection between two stations, to identify the sender and receiver, to
ensure that all messages are passed correctly without errors, and to handle all
control functions involved in a sequence of data transfers. Protocols are divided
into two major categories according to the message-framing technique used.
These are character-oriented protocol and bit-oriented protocol.

Character-Oriented Protocol

The character-oriented protocol is based on the binary code of a character set.
The code most commonly used is ASCII (American Standard Code for Infor-
mation Interchange). It is a 7-bit code with an eighth bit used for parity. The
code has 128 characters, of which 95 are graphic characters and 33 are control
characters. The graphic characters include the upper- and lowercase letters, the
ten numerals, and a variety of special symbols. A list of the ASCII characters
can be found in Table 11-1. The control characters are used for the purpose of
routing data, arranging the test in a desired format, and for the layout of the
Printed page. The characters that control the transmission are called communi-
cation control characters. These characters are listed in Table 11-4. Each character
has a 7-bit code and is referred to by a three-letter symbol. The role of each
character in the control of data transmission is stated briefly in the function
column of the table.

‘The SYNcharacterservesas synchronizing agent between thetransmitter
and receiver. When the 7-bit ASCII code is used with an odd-parity bit in the
most significant position, the assigned SYN character has the S-bit code
00010110 which has the property that, upon circular shifting, it repeats itself
onlyaftera full 8-bit cycle. When the transmitterstarts sending 8-bit characters,
it sends a few characters first and then sends the actual message. The initial
continuous string of bits accepted by the receiver is checked for a SYN charac-
ter. Inother words, with each clock pulse, the receiver checks the last eight bits
