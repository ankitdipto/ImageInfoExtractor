= LU,

yielding the LUP decomposition. Because L’ is unit lower-triangular, so is L, and
because U’ is upper-triangular, so is U.

Notice that in this derivation, unlike the one for LU decomposition, we must
multiply both the column vector v/ag; and the Schur complement A’ — vw" /aj
by the permutation matrix P’. Here is the pseudocode for LUP decomposition:

LUP-DEcoMPosITION(A)
