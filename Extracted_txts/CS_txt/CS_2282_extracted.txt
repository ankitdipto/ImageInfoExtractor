CHAPTER ELEVEN Input-Output Organization

A typical message that might be sent from a terminal to the processor is
listed in Table 11-5. A look at this message reveals that there are a number of
control characters used for message formation. Each character, including the
control characters, is transmitted serially as an 8-bit binary code which consists
of the 7-bit ASCII code plus an odd parity bit in the eighth most significant
position. The two SYN characters are used to synchronize the receiver and
transmitter. The heading starts with the SOH character and continues with two
characters that specify the address of the terminal. In this particular example,
the address is T4, but in general it can have any set of two or more graphic
characters. The STX character terminates the heading and signifies the begin-
ning of the text transmission. The text data of concer here is “request balance
of account number 1234.” The individual characters for this message are not
listed in the table because they will take too much space. It must be realized,
however, that each character in the message has an 8-bit code and that each
bit is transmitted serially. The ETX control character signifies the termination
of the text characters. The next character following ETX is a longitudinal
redundancy check (LRO. Each bit in this characteris a parity bit calculated from
all the bits in the same column in the code section of the table.

The data communication processor receives this message and proceeds
to analyze it. It recognizes terminal T4 and stores the text associated with the
message. While receiving the characters, the processor checks the parity in
each character and also computes the longitudinal parity. The computed LRC
is compared with the LRC character received, If the two match, a positive
acknowledgment (ACK) is sent back to the terminal. If a mismatch exists, a
