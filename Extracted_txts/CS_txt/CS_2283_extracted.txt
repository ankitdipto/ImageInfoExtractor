NAND Gate Decoder

Some decoders are constructed with NAND instead of AND gates. Since a
AND gate produces the AND operation with an inverted output, it becomes
more economical to generate the decoder outputs in their complement form.
A2-to-4-line decoder with an enable input constructed with NAND gates is
shown in Fig. 2-2 The circuit operates with complemented outputs and a
complemented enable input E. The decoder is enabled when E is equal to 0.
As indicated by the truth table, only one output is equal to0 at any given time;
the other three outputs are equal to 1. The output whose value is equal to 0
represents the equivalent binary number in inputs A, and Ap. The circuit is
disabled when E is equal to 1, regardless of the values of the other two inputs.
