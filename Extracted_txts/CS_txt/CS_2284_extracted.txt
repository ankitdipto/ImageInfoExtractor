SECTION 11-8 Serial Communication 435,

negative acknowledgment (NAK) is returned to the terminal, which would
initiate a retransmission of the same block. If the processor finds the message
without errors, it transfers the message into memory and interrupts the CPU.
When the CPU acknowledges the interrupt, it analyzes the message and
prepares a text message for responding to the request The CPU sends an
instruction to the data communication processor to send the message to the
terminal.

A typical response from processor to terminal is listed in Table 11-6. After
two SYN characters, the processor acknowledges the previous message with
an ACK character. The line continues to idle with SYN character waiting for
the response to come. The message received from the CPU is arranged in the
proper format by the processor by inserting the required control characters
before and after the text. The message has the heading SOH and the address
of the terminal T4. The text message informs the terminal that the balance is
$100. An LRC character is computed and sent to the terminal. If the terminal
responds with a NAK character, the processor retransmits the message.

While the processor is taking care of this terminal it is busy processing
other terminals as well. Since the characters are received ina serial fashion, it
takes a certain amount of time to receive and collect an 8-bit character. During
this time the processor is multiplexing all other communication lines and
