Problems 441

The bits in the control register of the FIFO shown in Fig. 11-9 are
FRBF, = O11. Give the sequence of internal operations when an item is
deleted from the FIFO and then a new item is inserted

What are the values of input ready and output ready and control bits
through F, in Fig. 11-9 when:

a. The buffer is empty?

b. The buffer is full?

¢. The buffer contains two data items?

‘Show a block diagram similar to Fig. 11-10 for the data transfer from a CPU
toan interface and then to an UO device. Determine a procedure for setting
and clearing the flag bit.

Using the configuration established in Prob. 11-16, obtain a flowchart (sim-
ilar to Fig. 11-11) for the CPU program to output data.

What is the basicadvantage of using interrupt-initiated data transfer over
transfer under program control without an interrupt?

In most computers an interrupt is ed only after the execution of the
instruction. Consider the poseblty of acknowledging the interrupt at any
time during the execution of the instruction. Discuss the difficulty that may
arise,

What happens inthe daisy-chain priority interrupt shown in Fig, 11-12 when.
device 1 requests an interrupt after device2 has sent an interrupt request to
the CPU but before the CPU responds with the interrupt acknowledge?
Consider a computer without priority interrupt hardware. Any one of many
sources can interrupt the computer, and any interrupt request results in
storing the return address and branching to a common interrupt routine.
Explain how a priority can be established in the interrupt service program.
Using combinational circuit design techniques, derive the Boolean expres-
sions listed in Table 11-2 for the priority encoder. Draw the logic diagram of
the circuit.

Design a parallel priority interrupt hardware for a system with eight inter-
rupt sources.

Obtain the truth table of an 8 x 3 priority encoder. Assume that the three
‘outputs xy2 from the priority encoder are used to provide a vector address
of the form 101xy200. List the eight vector addresses starting from the one
with the highest priority.

What should be done in Fig. 11-14 tomake the four VAD values equal tothe
binary equivalent of 76, 77, 78, and 79?

What programming steps are required to check when a source interrupts the
computer while itis still being serviced by a previous interrupt request from
the same source?

Why are the read and write control lines in a DMA controller bidirectional?
Under what conditionand for what purpose are they used as inputs? Under
what condition and for what purpose are they used as outputs?
