section starting from address 1230. The transfer is by means of DMA as

shown in Fig 11-18.

a. Give the initial values that the CPU must transferto the DMA comtvller.

b. Give the step-by-stepaccount of the actions teken duringthe input ofthe
first two wards.

A DMA coctraller transfers 16-bit wards to nemory nsingcycle stealing. The

words are assembled fromadevice that transmits chasarters ata rate of 2400

characters pet second. The CPU is fetching and executing instructions atan

average rate of 1 mullian instructions per second. By how much wil the CPU

bbe slowed down becance of the DMA transfer?

Wty does DMA have priority over the CPU when both request a memory

wansfer?

Dawa flawahort similar to the one in Fig. 11-20 that describes the CPULO

channel communication in the IBM 370,

‘The address of @ termina) connerted 40 a data communication
