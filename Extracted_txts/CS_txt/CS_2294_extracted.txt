12-1_Memory Hierarchy

The memory unit is an essential componentin any digital computer since itis
needed for storing programs and data. A very small computer with a limited
application may be able to fulfil its intended task without the need of addi-
tional storage capacity. Most general-purpose eomputers would run more
efficiently if they were equipped with additional storage beyond the capacity
of the main memory. There is just not enough space in one memory unit ©
accommodate all the programs used in a typical computer. Moreover, most
computer users accumulate and continue to accumulate Jarge amounts of
data-processing software. Not all accumulated information is needed by the
processor at the same time, Therefote, it is more economical $0 use low-cost
storage devices to serve as a backup for storing the information that is not
currently used by the CPU. The memory unit that communicates directly with
the CPU is called the main memory. Devices that provide backup storage are
allied auxiliary memory. The most common atpiliary memory devises used in
computer systems are magnetic disks and tapes. They are used for etoring
system programs, large data files, and other backup information. Only pro-
gzamsand data currently needed by the processor reside in main memory. All
