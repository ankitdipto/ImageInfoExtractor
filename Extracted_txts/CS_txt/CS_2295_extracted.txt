When the circuit is disabled, none of the outputs are selected and all outputs
are equal to 1. In general, a decoder may operate with complemented or
uncomplemented outputs. The enable input may be activated with a 0 or with
a 1 signal level. Some decoders have two or more enable inputs that must
satisfy a given logic condition in order to enable the circuit.

Decoder Expansion
There are occasions when a certain-size decoder is needed but only smaller
sizes are available. When this occurs it is possible to combine two or more
decoders with enable inputs to form a larger decoder. Thus if a 6-to-64-line
decoder is needed, itis possible to construct it with four 4-to-I6-line decoders.
Figure 2-3 shows how decoders with enable inputs can be connected to
form a larger decoder. Two 2-to-+-line decoders are combined to achieve a
34o-8-line decoder. The two least significant bits of the input are connected to
both decoders. The most significant bit is connected to the enable input of one
decoder and through an inverter to the enable input of the other decoder. It
is assumed that each decoder is enabled when its E input is equal to 1. When
Eisequal to0, the decoder is disabled and all its outputs are in the Olevel. When
‘Ax = 0, the upper decoder is enabled and the lower is disabled. The lower
decoder outputs become inactive with all outputs at 0. The outputs of the upper
decoder generate outputs D, through Ds, depending on the values of A; and
‘Ag (While A; = 0). When Az = 1, the lower decoder is enabled and the upper
is disabled. The lower decoder output generates the binary equivalent D,
through D; since these binary numbers have a 1 in the A; position.
