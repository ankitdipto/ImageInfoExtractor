first address of the bootstrap loader. The bootstrap program loads a portion
of the operating system from disk to main memory and control is then trans-
ferred to the operating system, which prepares the computer for general use.

RAM and ROM chips are available in a variety of sizes. If the memory
needed for the computer is larger than the capacity of one chip, its necessary
to combine a number of chips to form the required memory size. To demon-
strate the chip interconnection, we will show an example of a1024 x 8memory
constructed with 128 x 8 RAM chips and 512 x 8 ROM chips.

RAM and ROM Chips
ARAM chip is better suited for communication with the CPU if it has one or
more control inputs that select the chip only when needed. Another common
feature is a bidirectional data bus that allows the transfer of data either from
memory to CPU during a read operation, or from CPU to memory during a
write operation. A bidirectional bus can be constructed with three-state
buffers A three-state buffer output can be placed in one of three possible
states: a signal equivalent to logic 1, a signal equivalent to logic 0, or a high-
impedance state. The logic 1 and 0 are normal digital signals. The high-
impedance state behaves like an open circuit, which means that the output
does not carry a signal and has no logic significance.

The block diagram of a RAM chip is shown in Fig. 12-2. The capacity of
thememory is 128 words of eightbits (one byte) per word. Thisrequiresa 7-bit
