to be used are specified in Figs. 12-2 and 12-3, The memory address map for
this configuration is shown in Table 12-1. The component column specifies
whether a RAM or a ROM chip is used. The hexadecimal address column
assigns a range of hexadecimal equivalent addresses for each chip. The address
bus lines are listed in the third column. Although there are 16 lines in the
address bus, the table shows only 10 lines because the other 6 are not used in
this example and are assumed to be zero. The small x's under the address bus
lines designate those lines that must be connected to the address inputs in each
chip. The RAM chips have 128 bytes and need seven address lines. The ROM
chip has 512 bytes and needs 9 address lines. The x’s are always assigned to
the low-order bus lines: lines 1 through 7 for the RAM and lines 1 through 9
for the ROM. It is now necessary to distinguish between four RAM chips by
assigning to each a different address. For this particular example we choose bus
lines 8and9 to represent four distinct binary combinations. Note that any other
pair of unused bus lines can be chosen for this purpose. The table clearly shows
that the nine low-order bus lines constitute a memory space for RAM equal to
2 = 512 bytes The distinction between a RAMand ROM address is done with
another bus line. Here we choose line 10 for this purpose. When line 10 is 0,
the CPU selects a RAM, and when this line is equal to 1, it selects the ROM.

‘The equivalent hexadecimal address for each chip is obtained from the
information under the address bus assignment. The address bus lines are
