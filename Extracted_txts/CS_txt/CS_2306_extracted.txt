recognize the sectors, A disk system is addressed by address bits that specify
the disk number, the disk surface, the sector number and the track within the
sector. After the read/write heads are positioned in the specified track, the
system has to wait until the rotating disk reaches the specified sector under the
read/write head. Information transfer is very fast once the beginning ofa sector
hhas been reached. Disks may have multiple heads and simultaneous transfer
of bits from several tracks at the same time.

‘A track in a given sector near the circumference is longer than a track near
the center of the disk. If bits are recorded with equal density, some tracks will
contain more recorded bits than others. To make all the records in a sector of,
equal length, some disks use a variable recordingdensity with higher density
on tracksnear the center than on tracks near the circumference. This equalizes
the number of bits on all tracks of a given sector.

Disks that are permanently attached to the unit assembly and cannot be
removed by the occasional user are called hard disks. A disk drive with remov-
able disks is called a floppy disk. The disks used with a floppy disk drive are
small removable disks made of plastic coated with magnetic recording material.
There are twosizes commonly used, with diameters of 5.25 and 3.5 inches. The
3.5:inch disksare smaller and can store more data than can the 5.25-inch disks.
Floppy disks are extensively used in personal computers as a medium for
distributing software to computer users.

Magnetic Tape

‘A magnetic tape transport consists of the electrical, mechanical, and electronic
components to provide the parts and control mechanism for a magnetic-tape
unit. The tape itself is a strip of plastic coated with a magnetic recording
