SECTION 22 Decoders 47

The example demonstrates the usefulness of the enable input in decoders
or any other combinational logic component. Enable inputs are a convenient
feature for interconnecting two or more circuits for the purpose of expand-
ing the digital component into a similar function but with more inputs and
outputs.

Encoders

An encoders a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of adecoder.
â€˜An encoder has 2" (or less) input lines and n output lines. The output lines
generate the binary code corresponding to the input value. An example of an
encoder is the octal-to-binary encoder, whose truth table is given in Table 2-2.
It has eight inputs, one for each of the octal digits, and three outputs that
generate the corresponding binary number. It is assumed that only one input
has a value of 1 at any given time; otherwise, the circuit has no meaning.

The encoder can be implemented with OR gates whose inputs are deter-
mined directly from the truth table. Output Ap = 1 if the input octal digit is 1
or 3 or 5 or 7. Similar conditions apply for the other two outputs. These
conditions can be expressed by the following Boolean functions:

Ay = Dy + Ds + Ds + Dy
A, = Di + Ds + De + Dy
Az = Dy + Ds + Ds + Dy

The encoder can be implemented with three OR gates.
