an entire word or on a specific field within a word. An associative memory is
more expensive than a random access memory because each cell must have
storage capability as well as logic circuits for matching its content with an
external argument. For this reason, associative memories are used in applica-
tions where the search time is very critical and must be very short.

‘Hardware Organization

The block diagram of an associative memory is shown in Fig. 12-6. It consists
ofa memory array and logic for m words with n bits per word. The argument
register A and key register K each have n bits, one for each bit of a word. The
match register M has m bits, one foreach memory word. Each word in memory
is compared in parallel with the content of the argument register. The words
that match the bits of the argument register set a corresponding bitin the match
register. After the matching process, those bits in the match register that have
been set indicate the fact that their corresponding words have been matched.
Reading is accomplished by a sequential access to memory for those words
whose corresponding bits in the match register have been set.

The key register provides a mask for choosing a particular field or key in
the argument word. The entire argument is compared with each memory word
if the key register contains all 1’s. Otherwise, only those bits in the argument
that have 1’s in their corresponding position of the key register are compared.
Thus the key provides a mask or identifying piece of information which
