28.2 Inverting matrices

Although in practice we do not generally use matrix inverses to solve systems of
linear equations, preferring instead to use more numerically stable techniques such
as LUP decomposition, sometimes we need to compute a matrix inverse. In this
section, we show how to use LUP decomposition to compute a matrix inverse.
We also prove that matrix multiplication and computing the inverse of a matrix
are equivalently hard problems, in that (subject to technical conditions) we can
use an algorithm for one to solve the other in the same asymptotic running time.
Thus, we can use Strassen’s algorithm (see Section 4.2) for matrix multiplication
to invert a matrix. Indeed, Strassen’s original paper was motivated by the problem
of showing that a set of a linear equations could be solved more quickly than by
the usual method.
