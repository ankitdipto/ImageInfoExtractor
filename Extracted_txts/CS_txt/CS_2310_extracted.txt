(CHAPTER TWELVE Memory Organization

specifies how the reference to memory is made. To illustrate with a numericai
example, suppose that the argument register A and the key register K have the
bit configuration shown below. Only the three leftmost bits of A are compared
with memory words because K has 1s in these positions.

 

A 101 111100
K m1 000000

Word1 100111100 no match
Word2 101 000001 match

Word 2 matches the unmasked argument field because the three leftmost bits
of the argument and the word are equal.

The relation between the memory array and external registers in an
associative memory is shown in Fig. 12-7. The cells in the array are marked by
the letter C with two subcripts. The first subscript gives the word number and
the second specifies the bit position in the word. Thus cell C; is the cell for bit
jin word i. A bit A; in the argument register is compared with all the bits in
column j of the array provided that Kj = 1. This is done for all columns
j= 12,...,m Ifa match occurs between all the unmasked bits of the argu-
â€˜ment and the bits in word i, the corresponding bit M, in the match register is
set to 1. Ifone or more unmasked bits of the argument and the word do not
match, M, is cleared to 0.
