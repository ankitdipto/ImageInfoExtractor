SECTION 12-4 Associative Memory 459

The intemal organization of a typical cell G; is shown in Fig. 12-8. It
consists of a flip-flop storage element F, and the circuits forreading, writing,
and matching the cell. The input bit is transferred into the storage cell during
awrite operation. The bit stored is read out during a read operation. The match
logic compares the content of the storage cell with the corresponding un-
masked bit of the argument and provides an output for the decision logic that
sets the bit in M;.

Match Logic

The match logic for each word can be derived from the comparison algorithm
for two binary numbers First, we neglect the key bits and compare the argu-
ment in A with the bits stored in the cells of the words. Word i is equal to the
argument in A if A, = F; for j = 1,2,...,. Twobits are equal if they are both
or both 0. The equality of two bits can be expressed logically by the Boolean
function

 

Avy + A/F
where x; = 1 if the pair of bits in position j are equal; otherwise, x; = 0.
Fora word ito be equal to the argument in A we must have all x; variables
equal to 1. This is the condition for setting the corresponding match bit M; to
1. The Boolean function for this condition is
M,=4mx-%

and constitutes the AND operation of all pairs of matched bits in a word.
