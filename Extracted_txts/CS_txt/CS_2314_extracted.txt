Figure 12-9 Match logic for one word of associative memory.

In most applications, the associative memory stores a table with no two
identical items under a given key. In this case, only one word may match the
unmasked argument field By connecting output M; directly to the read line in
the same word position (instead of the M register), the content of the matched
word will be presented automatically at the output lines and no special read
command signal is needed. Furthermore, if we exclude words having a zero
content, an all-zero output will indicate that no match occurred and that the
searched item is not available in memory.

Write Operation

An associative memory must havea write capability for storing the information
to be searched. Writing in an associative memory can take different forms,
depending on the application. If the entire memory is loaded with new infor-
mation at once prior to a search operation then the writing can be done by
addressing each location in sequence. This will make the device'a random-
access memory for writingand a content addressable memory for reading. The
advantage here is that the address for input can be decoded as in a random-
access memory. Thus instead of having m address lines, one for each word in
memory, the number of address lines can be reduced by the decoder tod lines,
where m = 24 -
