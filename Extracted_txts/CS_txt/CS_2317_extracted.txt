a duplicate copy in main memory. The CPU communicates with both memo-
ries. It first sends a 15-bit address to cache. If there is a hit, the CPU accepts
the 12-bit data from cache. Ifthereis amiss, the CPU reads the word from main
memory and the word is then transferred to cache.

Associative Mapping

The fastest and mast flexible cache organization uses an associative memory.
This organization is illustrated in Fig. 12-11. The associative memory stores
both the address and content (data) of the memory word. This permits any
location in cache to store any word from main memory. The diagram shows
three words presently stored in the cache. The address value of 15 bits isshown
as a five-digit octal number and its corresponding 12-bit word is shown as a
four-digit octal number. A CPU address of 15 bits is placed in the argument
register and the associative memory is searched for a matching address. If the
