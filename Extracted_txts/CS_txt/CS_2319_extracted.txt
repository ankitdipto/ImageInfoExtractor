23__Multiplexers

A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that receives binary information from
one of 2 input data lines and directs it to a single output line. The selec-
tion of a particular input data line for the output is determined by a set of
selection inputs A 2"-to-1 multiplexer has 2" input data lines and n input
selection lines whose bit combinations determine which input data are selected
for the output.

‘A 4to-1-line multiplexer is shown in Fig. 2-4. Each of the four data inputs
through I, is applied to one input of an AND gate. The two selection inputs
5, and S, are decoded to select a particular AND gate. The outputs of the AND
gates are applied to a single OR gate to provide the single output. To demon-
strate the circuit operation, consider the case when $;S, = 10. The AND gate
associated with input J; has two of its inputs equal to 1. The third input of the
gate is connected to f. The otherthree AND gates have at least one input equal
to 0, which makes their outputs equal to 0. The OR gate output is now equal
to the value of h, thus providing path from the selected input to the output.

The 4-to-1 line multiplexer of Fig. 2-4 has six inputs and one output. A
truth table describing the circuit needs 64 rows since six input variables can
have 2 binary combinations. This is an excessively long table and will not be
shown here. A more convenient way to describe the operation of multiplexers
is by means of a function table. The function table for the multiplexer is shown
in Table 2-3, The table demonstrates the relationship between the four data
inputs and the single output as a function of the selection inputs S; and Sy
