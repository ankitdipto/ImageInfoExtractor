tag field of the CPU address is compared with the tag in the word read from
the cache. If the two tags match, there is a hit and the desired data word is in
cache. If there is no match, there is a miss and the required word is read from
main memory. It is then stored in the cache together with the new tag,
replacing the previous value. The disadvantage of direct mapping is that the
hitratio can drop considerably if two or more words whose addresses have the
same index but differenttags are accessed repeatedly. However, this possibility
is minimized by the fact that such words are relatively far apart in the address
range (multiples of 512 locations in this example.)

To see how the direct-mapping organization operates, consider the nu-
merical example shown in Fig. 12-13. The word at address zero is presently
stored in the cache (index = 000, tag = 00, data = 1220). Suppose that the CPU
now wants to access the word at address 02000. The index address is 000, so
it is used to access the cache. The two tags are then compared. The cache tag
is 00 but the address tag is 02, which does not produce a match. Therefore, the
main memory is accessed and the data word 5670 is transferred to the CPU.
The cache word at index address 000 is then replaced with a tag of 02 and data
of 5670.

The direct-mapping example just described uses a blocksize of one word.
Thesame organization but using a block size of 8 wordsis shown in Fig, 12-14.
