Figure 12-14 Direct mapping cache with block size of 8 words.

The index field is now divided into two parts: the block field and the word field.
In a 512-word cache there are 64 blocks of 8 words each, since 64 x 8 = 512.
The block number is specified with a 6-bit field and the word within the block
is specified with a 3-bit field. The tag field stored within the cache is common
to all eight words of the same block. Every time a miss occurs, an entire block
of eight words must be transferred from main memory to cache memory.
Although this takes extra time, the hit ratio will most likely improve with a
larger block size because of the sequential nature of computer programs.

Set-Associative Mapping

It was mentioned previously that the disadvantage of direct mapping is that
two words with the same index in their address but with different tag values
cannot reside in cache memory at the same time. A third type of cache organ-
ization, called set-associative mapping, is an improvement over the direct-
mapping organization in that each word of cache can store two or more words
of memory under the same index address. Each data word is stored together
with its tag and the number of tag-data items in one word of cache is said to
form a set. An example of a set-associative cache organization for a set size of
two is shown in Fig. 12-15. Each index address refers to two data words and
their associated tags. Each tag requires six bits and each data word has 12 bits,
so the word length is 2(6 + 12) = 36 bits. An index address of nine bits can
accommodate 512 words Thus the size of cache memory is 512 x 36. It can
accommodate 1024 words of main memory since each word of cache contains
two data words. In general, a set-associative cache of set size k will accommo-
date k words of main memory in each word of cache.
