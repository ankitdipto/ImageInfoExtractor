example, A=B represents a constraint that the solutions to the A and B tests must be equal.
Rectangles are actions.

 

 

 

memory the "add D” rule is the only one that fires, resulting in the addition ofthe sentence D(2)
to working memory.

One obvious advantage of the rete network is that it eliminates duplication between rules.
All three of the rules start with a conjunction of A and B, and the network allows that part to be
shared. The second advantage of rete networks is in eliminating duplication over time. Most
production systems make only a few changes to the knowledge base on each cycle. This means
that most of the tests at cycle ¢+\ will give the same result as at cycle ¢. The rete network modifies
itself after each addition or deletion, but ifthere are few changes, then the cost of each update
will be small relative to the whole job of maintaining the indexing information. The network
thus represents the saved intermediate state in the process of testing for satisfaction of a set of
conjuncts. In this case, adding D(2) will result in the activation of the "add E” rule, but will not
have any effect on the rest of the network. Adding or deleting an 4, however, will have a bigger
effect that needs to be propagated through much of the network.

Conflict resolution phase

Some production systems execute the actions of all rules that pass the match phase. Other
production systems treat these rules only as suggestions, and use the conflict resolution phase to
decide which of the suggestions to accept. This phase can be thought of as the control strategy.
Some of the strategies that have been used are as follows:

+ No duplication. Do not execute the same rule on the same arguments twice.

+ Recency. Prefer rules that refer to recently created working memory elements.
