efficient transfers, auxiliary storage moves an entire record to the main mem-
ory.) A table is then needed, as shown in Fig. 12-17, to map a virtual address
of 20bits toa physical address of 15 bits. The mapping is a dynamic operation,
which means that every address is translated imunediately as a word is refer-

enced by CPU.

The mapping table may be stored in a separate memory as shown in
Fig. 12-17 or in main memory. In the first case, an additional memory unit is
required as well as one extra memory access time. In the second case, the table
