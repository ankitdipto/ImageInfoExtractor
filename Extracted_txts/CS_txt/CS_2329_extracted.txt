CHAPTER TWELVE Memory Organization

transfers the content of the word to the main memory buffer register ready to
be used by the CPU. If the presence bit in the word read from the page table
is 0, it signifies that the content of the word referenced by the virtual address
does not reside in main memory. A call to the operating system is then
generated to fetch the required page from auxiliary memory and place it into
main memory before resuming computation.

Associative Memory Page Table

‘A random-access memory page table is inefficient with respect to storage
utilization. In the example of Fig. 12-19 we observe that eight words of memory
are needed, one for each page, but at least four words will always be marked
empty because main memory cannot accomunodate more than four blocks. In
general, a system with n pages and m blocks would require a memory-page
table of n locations of which up to m blocks will be marked with block numbers
and all others will be empty. As a second numerical example, consider an
address space of 1024K words and memory space of 32K words. If each page
or block contains 1K words, the number of pages is 1024 and the number of
blocks 32. The capacity of the memory-page table mustbe 1024 wordsand only
32 locations may have a presence bitequal to 1. At any given time, at least 992
locations will be empty and not in use.

‘A more efficient way to organize the page table would be to construct it
with anumber of words equal to the number of blocks in main memory. In this
‘way the size of the memory is reduced and each location is fully utilized. This
method can be implemented by means of an associative memory with each
word in memory containing a page number together with its corresponding
