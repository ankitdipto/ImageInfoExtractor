Figure 12-22 An example of logical and physical addresses.

Fig. 12-23(b). The information from this table is entered in the segment and
page tables as shown in Fig. 12-24(a).

Now consider the specific logical address given in Fig. 12-24. The 20-bit
address is listed as a five-digit hexadecimal number. It refers to word number
7E of page 2 in segment 6. The base of segment 6 in the page table is at address
35. Segment 6 has associated with it five pages, as shown in the page table at
addresses 35 through 39. Page 2 of segment 6 is at address 35 + 2 = 37. The
physical memory block is found in the page table to be 019. Word 7E in block
19 gives the 20-bit physical address 0197E. Note that page 0 of segment 6 maps
