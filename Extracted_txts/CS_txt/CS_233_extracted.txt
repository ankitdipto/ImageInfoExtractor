28.2. Inverting matrices 829

I, A 0

D=|0 I, B

0 0 tT

The inverse of D is
I, —A AB
D'={|0 I, -B
0 0

and thus we can compute the product AB by taking the upper right 7 x 7 submatrix
of D*.

We can construct matrix D in @(n7) time, which is O(/(1)) because we assume
that J(n) = Q(n?), and we can invert D in O(/(3n)) = O(J(n)) time, by the
regularity condition on J(n). We thus have M(n) = O(/(n)). .

Note that /(7) satisfies the regularity condition whenever J(n) = ©(n° 1g! n)
for any constants c > 0 andd > 0.

The proof that matrix inversion is no harder than matrix multiplication relies
on some properties of symmetric positive-definite matrices that we will prove in
Section 28.3.

Theorem 28.2 (Inversion is no harder than multiplication)

Suppose we can multiply two n x n real matrices in time M(n), where M(n) =
Q(n?) and M(n) satisfies the two regularity conditions M(n +k) = O(M(n)) for
any k in the range 0 < k < n and M(n/2) < cM(n) for some constant c < 1/2.
Then we can compute the inverse of any real nonsingular n x n matrix in time
O(M(n)).

Proof We prove the theorem here for real matrices. Exercise 28.2-6 asks you to
generalize the proof for matrices whose entries are complex numbers.
We can assume that 7 is an exact power of 2, since we have

A 0\'_ (47 0
0k) “Lo x

for any k > 0. Thus, by choosing k such that n + k is a power of 2, we enlarge
the matrix to a size that is the next power of 2 and obtain the desired answer A~!
from the answer to the enlarged problem. The first regularity condition on M(n)
ensures that this enlargement does not cause the running time to increase by more
than a constant factor.

For the moment, let us assume that the m x matrix A is symmetric and positive-
definite. We partition each of A and its inverse A~! into four n/2 x n/2 submatri-
