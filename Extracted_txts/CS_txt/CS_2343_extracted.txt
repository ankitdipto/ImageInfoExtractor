the system?

A vietual memory has a page size of IK words There ate eight poges

and four blocks. The associative memary page table contains the fullovng,

entries:

Make a list of all virtual addresses (in decinal) that will cause a page fault
if used by the CPU.

A virtual memary system has artaddress space of &K words, a memory space
Of 4K words, and Page arid block sizes of 1K words (see Fig. 12-18) The
following page reference changes occur during a given time interval, (Only
age changes are listed. Ifthe same page is referenced again. itis not sted
twice.)

Determine the four pages that are resident in main memory after each page
reference change lf the replacement algorithm used is (2) FIFO; (0) LRU.
Determine the two logical addcesses from Fig. 12.24a) that will access
physical memory at hexadecional address O12AF.

‘The logical addsess space in a cumputer system consists of 128 segments.
Each segmenit can have up to.32 pages of 4K words in each. Physical memory
consists of 4K blocks of 4K words in each. Formulate the logical and physical
address formats.

Give the binacy number of the logics) address formulated in Prob. 12-23 for
segment 36 atid word number 2000 i page 15.
