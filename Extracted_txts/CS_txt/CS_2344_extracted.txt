A register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit
of information. An r-bit register has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of
storing any binary information of n bits. In addition to the flip-flops, a register
may have combinational gates that perform certain data-processing tasks. In
its broadest definition, a register consists of a group of flip-flops and gates that
effect their transition. The flip-flops hold the binary information and the gates,
control when and how new information is transferred into the register.

Various types of registers are available commercially. The simplest regis-
ter is one that consists only of flip-flops, with no external gates. Figure 2-6
shows such a register constructed with four D flip-flops. The common clock
input triggers all flip-flops on the rising edge of each pulse, and the binary data
available at the four inputs are transferred into the 4-bit register. The four
outputs can be sampled at any time to obtain the binary information stored in
the register. The clear input goes to a special terminal in each flip-flop. When
this input goes to 0, all flip-flops are reset asynchronously. The clear input is
useful for clearing the register to all 0's prior to its clocked operation. The clear
input must be maintained at logic 1 duringnormal clocked operation. Note that
the clocksignal enables the D input but that the clear input is independent of
the clock.

The transfer of new information intoa register is referred toas loading the
register. If all the bits of the register are loaded simultaneously with acommon
