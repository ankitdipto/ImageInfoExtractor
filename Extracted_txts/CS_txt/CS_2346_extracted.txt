L Characteristics of Multiprocessors

A multiprocessor system is an interconnection of two or more CPUs with
memory and input-outputequipment. The term “processo¢” in multiprocesor
can mean either a centeal processing unit (CPU) or an input-output processor
(OP). However, a system with a single CPUand one or more IOPs is usually
not included in the definition of a multiprocessor system unless the [OP has
computational facilities comparabletoa CPU. Asitismostcommonly defined,
a multiprocessor system implies the existence of multiple CPUs, although
usually thete will be one or more IOPs as well. As mentioned in Sec. 9-1,
multiprocessors are classified as multiple instruction stream, multiple data
stream (MIMD) systems.

‘There are some similarities between multipeosessor and multicomputer
systems since bath support concurrent operations. However, there exists an
important distinction between a system with multiple computers and asystem
with multiple processors. Computers are intereannected with eash other by
means of communication lines to form acom puter network. The network consists
of several autonomous computers that may or may not communicate witheach
other. A multiprocessor system is controlled by one operating system that
providesinteraction between processorsand all the components of the system
cooperate in the solution of a problem.
