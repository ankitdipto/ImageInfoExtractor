access time of the local memory can be made to approach the cycle time of the
CPU to which it is attached.

Muttiport Memory
‘A multiport memoty system employs separate buses between each memory
module and each CPU. This is shown in Fig. 13-3 for four CPUs and four
memory modules (MMs) Each processor bus is connected to each memory
module. A processor bus consists of the address, data and control tines
required to communicate with memory. The memory moduleis said to have
four ports and each port accommodates one of the buses. The module must
haveinternalcontzol logicto determine which pott will have aacess to memary
at any given time. Memory access conflicts are resolved by axsigning fixed
prorties toeach memory port. The priotity for memory access associated with
each processor may be established by the physical port position that ‘ts bus
occupies in each module. Thus CPU 1 will have priotity over CPU 2, CPU 2
will have priority over CPU'3, and CPU 4 will have the lowest prion'ty.
‘Theadvantage of the multiport memory organization is the high transfer
rate that conbe achieved because ofthe multiple pathsbetween processors and
memory. The disadvantage is thatit requires expensive memoty control logic
and a large number of cablesand connectors. As a consequence, this intercan-
