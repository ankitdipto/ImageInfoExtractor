processors.

Crossbar Switch
The crossbar switch organization consists of a number of crosspoints that are
placed at intersections between processor buses and memory module paths.
Figure 13-4 shows a crossbar switch interconnection between four CPUs and
four memory modules, The small square in each crosspoint is a switch that
determines the path froma processor to a memory module. Each switchpoint
hascontrol logic to set up the transfer path between a processor and memory.
It examines the address that is placed in the bus to determine whether its
particular module is being addressed. It also resolves multiple requests for
access to the same memory module on a predetermined priority basis.
Figure 13-5 shows the functional design of a crossbar switch connected
toone memory module. The circuit consists of multiplexers that select the data,
