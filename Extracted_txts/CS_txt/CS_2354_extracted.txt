496 HAPTER THIRTEEN Multiprocessors,

interchange switch

address, and control from one CPU for communication with the meme
module. Priority levels areestablished by the arbitration logic to select one C1
when two or more CPUs attempt to access the same memory. The multiplex
are controlled with the binary code that is generated by a priority encoc
within the arbitration logic.

‘A crossbar switch organization supports simultaneous transfers from
memory modules because there is a separate path associated with each mc
ule. However, the hardware required to implement the switch can beco!
quite large and complex.

Multistage Switching Network

The basic component of a multistage network is a two-input, two-outp
interchange switch. As shown in Fig. 134, the 2 x 2 switch has two inpu
labeled A and B, and two outputs, labeled 0 and 1. There are control sign
(not shown) associated with the switch that establish the interconnecti
between the input and output terminals. The switch has the capability
connecting input A to either of the outputs. Terminal B of the switch behav
ina similar fashion. The switch also has the capability to arbitrate betwe
conflicting requests, If inputs A and B both request the same output termin
only one of them will be connected; the other will be blocked.

Using the 2 x 2 switch as a building block, it is possible to build
multistage network tocontrol the communication between a number of sour
and destinations. To see how this is done, consider the binary tree shown
Fig. 13-7. Thetwo processors P, and P, are connected through switches to eig
memory modules marked in binary from 000 through 111. The path fron

source to a destination is determined from the binary bits of the destinati
