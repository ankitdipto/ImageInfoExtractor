number. The first bit of the destination number determines the switch output
in the firstlevel. The second bit specifies the output of the switch in the second
level, and the third bit specifies the output of the switch in the third level. For
example, to connect P, to memory 101, it is necessary to form a path from P,
to output 1 in the first-level switch, output 0 in the second-level switch, and
output lin the third-level switch. Itis clear that either P; or P; can be connected
to any one of the eight memories. Certain request patterns, however, cannot
be satisfied simultaneously. For example, if P, is connected to one of the
destinations 000 through 011, P; can be connected to only one of the destina-
tions 100 through 111.

Many different topologies have been proposed for multistage switching
networks to control processor-memory communication in a tightly coupled
multiprocessor system or to control the communication between the process-
ing elements in a loosely coupled system. One such topology is the omega
switchingnetworkshownin Fig. 13-8. In this configuration, there is exactly one
path from each source to any particular destination. Some request patterns,
however, cannot be connected simultaneously. For example, any two sources
cannot be connected simultaneously to destinations 000 and 001.
