clock pulse transition, we say that the loading is done in parallel. A clock
transition applied to the C inputs of the register of Fig. 2-6 will load all four
inputs I through I;in parallel. In this configuration, the clock must be inhibited
from the circuit if the content of the register must be left unchanged.

Register with Parallel Load

Most digital systems have a master clock generator that supplies a continuous
train of clock pulses. The clock pulses are applied to all flip-flops and registers
in the system. The master clock acts like a pump that supplies a constant beat
to all parts of the system. A separate control signal must be used to decide
which specific clock pulse will have an effect on a particular register.

A 4bit register with a load control input that is directed through gates
and into the D inputs is shown in Fig. 2-7. The C inputs receive clock pulses
at all times. The buffer gate in the clock input reduces the power requirement
