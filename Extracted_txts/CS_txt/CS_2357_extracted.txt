Figure 13-8 8 x 8 omega switching network.

A particular request is initiated in the switching network by the source,
which sends a 3-bit pattern representing the destination number. As the binary
pattern moves through the network, each level examines a different bit to
determine the 2 x 2 switch setting. Level 1 inspects the most significant bit,
level 2 inspects the middle bit. and level 3 inspects the least significant bit.
When the request anives on either input of the 2 x 2 switch, it is routed to the
upper output if the specified bit is 0 or to the lower output if the bit is 1.

Ina tightly coupled multiprocessor system, the source is a processor anc
the destination is a memory module. The fitst pass through the network sets
up the path. Succeeding passes are used to transfer the address into memory
and then transfer the data in either direction, depending on whether the
request isa read ora write. In a loosely coupled multiprocessar system, both
the source and destination are processing elements. After the path is estab-
lished, the source processor transfers a message to the destination proeestor.

Hypercube Interconnection

‘The hypercube or binary n-cube multiprocessor structureis a loosely coupled
system composed of N = 2° processors interconnected in an n-dimensianal
binary cube. Each processor formsa node of the cube. Although itis customary
