Figure 10.7 A frame-based network and a translation of the network into first-order logic.
Boxed relation names in the network correspond to relations holding for all members of the set
of objects.

 

 

 

The semantics ofa simple semantic network language can be stated by providing first-order
logical equivalents for assertions in the network language. We first define a version in which
exceptions are not allowed. In addition to Sand â€œember Jinks. we find that there is a need for
at least three other kinds of links: one that says a relation R holds between two objects, A and 5;
one that says R holds between every element of the class 4 and the object B; and one that says
that R holds between every element of A and some element of B. The five standard link types
are summarized in Figure 10,8,5 Notice that a theorem prover or logic programming language
could take the logical translations of the links and do inheritance by ordinary logical inference. A
semantic network system uses uses special-purpose algorithms for following links, and therefore
can be faster than general logical inference

8 Because assertions ofthe form L&] B are so common, we use the abbreviation Re/(R.4. B) as syntactic sugar in the
logical translation (Figure 10.7)
