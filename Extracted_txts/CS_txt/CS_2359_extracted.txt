SECTION 13-2 Interconnection Structures 499.

torefer to each node as having a processor, in effectit contains not only a CPU
but also local memory and UO interface. Each processor has direct communi-
cation paths to n other neighbor processors. These paths correspond to the
edges of the cube. There are 2" distinct m-bit binary addresses that can be
assigned to the processors. Each processor address differs from that of each
of its n neighbors by exactly one bit position.

Figure 13-9 shows the hypercube structure forn = 1,2, and3. Aone-cube
structure has n = 1 and 2" = 2. It contains two processors interconnected by
asingle path. A two-cube structure hasn = 2and 2" = 4. Itcontains four nodes
interconnected as a square. A three-cube structure has eight nodes intercon-
nected as a cube. An n-cube structure has 2" nodes with a processor residing
in each node. Each node is assigned a binary address in such a way that the
addresses of two neighbors differ in exactly one bit position. For example, the
three neighbors of the node with address 100 in a three-cube structure are 000,
110, and 101. Each of these binary numbers differs from address 100 by one
bit value.

Routing messages through an n-cube structure may take from one to 7
links from a source node to a destination node. For example, in a three-cube
structure, node 000 can communicate directly with node 001. It must cross at
least two links to communicate with 011 (from 000 to 001 to O11 or from 000
to010to 011). It is necessary to go through at least three links tocommunicate
fromnode 000 tonode 111. A routing procedure can be developed by comput-
ing the exclusive-OR of the source node address with the destination node
address. The resulting binary value will have 1 bits corresponding to the axes
on which the two nodes differ. The message is then sent along any one ofthe
axes. For example, in a three-cube structure, a message at 010 going to 001
producesan exclusive-OR of the two addresses equal to 011. The message can
be sent along the second axis to 000 and then through the third axis to O01.
