Serial Arbitration Procedure
Arbitration procedures service all processor requests on the basis of established
priorities. A hardware bus priority resolving technique can be established by
means of a serial or parallel connection of the units requesting control of
the system bus. The serial priority resolving technique is obtained from a
daisy-chain connection of bus arbitration circuits similar to the priority inter-
rupt logic presented in Sec. 11-5. The processors connected to the system bus
are assigned priority according to their position along the priority controlline.
The device closest to the priority line is assigned the highest priority. When
multiple devices concurrently request the use of the bus, the device with the
highest priority is granted access to it.

Figure 13-10 shows the daisy-chain connection of four arbiters. It is
assumed that each processor has its own bus arbiter logic with priority-in and
priority-out lines. The priority out (PO) of each arbiter is connected to the
