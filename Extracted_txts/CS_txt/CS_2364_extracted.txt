bus. The processor takes control of the bus if its acknowledge input line is
enabled. The bus busy line provides an orderly transfer of control, as in the
daisy-chaining case.

Figure 13-11 shows the requestlines from four arbiters going into a4 x 2
priority encoder. The output of the encoder generates a 2-bit code which
represents the highest-priority unit among those requesting the bus. The truth
table of the priority encoder can be found in Table 11-2 (Sec. 11-5). The 2-bit
code from the encoder output drives a2 x 4 decoder which enables the proper
acknowledge line to grant bus access to the highest-priority unit.

â€˜We can now explain the function of the bus arbitration signals listed in
Table 13-1. The bus priority-in BPRN and bus priority-out BPRO are used for
a daisy-chain connection of bus arbitration circuits. The bus busy signal BUSY
is an open-collector output used to instruct all arbiters when the bus is busy
conducting a transfer. The common bus request CBRQ is also an open-collector
output that serves to instruct the arbiter if there are any other arbiters of
lower-priority requesting use of the system bus. The signals used to construct
a parallel arbitration procedure are bus request BREQ and priority-in BPRN,
