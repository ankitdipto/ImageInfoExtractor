respectively. Selecting all possible subsequences of X and Y and matching
them up could take a prohibitively long time unless m and n are very small.
We shall see in Chapter 15 how to use a general technique known as dynamic
programming to solve this problem much more efficiently.

* Weare given a mechanical design in terms of a library of parts, where each part
may include instances of other parts, and we need to list the parts in order so
that each part appears before any part that uses it. If the design comprises n
parts, then there are 7! possible orders, where n! denotes the factorial function.
Because the factorial function grows faster than even an exponential function,
we cannot feasibly generate each possible order and then verify that, within
that order, each part appears before the parts using it (unless we have only a
few parts). This problem is an instance of topological sorting, and we shall see
in Chapter 22 how to solve this problem efficiently.

+ We are given 7 points in the plane, and we wish to find the convex hull of
these points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the
points. Intuitively, we can think of each point as being represented by a nail
sticking out from a board. The convex hull would be represented by a tight
rubber band that surrounds all the nails. Each nail around which the rubber
band makes a turn is a vertex of the convex hull. (See Figure 33.6 on page 1029
for an example.) Any of the 2” subsets of the points might be the vertices
of the convex hull. Knowing which points are vertices of the convex hull is
not quite enough, either, since we also need to know the order in which they
appear. There are many choices, therefore, for the vertices of the convex hull.
Chapter 33 gives two good methods for finding the convex hull.

These lists are far from exhaustive (as you again have probably surmised from
this book’s heft), but exhibit two characteristics that are common to many interest-
ing algorithmic problems:

1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do
not solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is “best,” can
present quite a challenge.

2. They have practical applications. Of the problems in the above list, finding the
shortest path provides the easiest examples. A transportation firm, such as a
trucking or railroad company, has a financial interest in finding shortest paths
through a road or rail network because taking shorter paths results in lower
labor and fuel costs. Or a routing node on the Internet may need to find the
shortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly. Or a
person wishing to drive from New York to Boston may want to find driving
directions from an appropriate Web site, or she may use her GPS while driving.
