Exercises

11-1
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that re-
quires computing a convex hull.

11-2
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?

11-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.

114
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?

11-5

Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.

 

1.2. Algorithms as a technology

Suppose computers were infinitely fast and computer memory was free. Would
you have any reason to study algorithms? The answer is yes, if for no other reason
than that you would still like to demonstrate that your solution method terminates
and does so with the correct answer.

If computers were infinitely fast, any correct method for solving a problem
would do. You would probably want your implementation to be within the bounds
of good software engineering practice (for example, your implementation should
be well designed and documented), but you would most often use whichever
method was the easiest to implement.

Of course, computers may be fast, but they are not infinitely fast. And memory
may be inexpensive, but it is not free. Computing time is therefore a bounded
resource, and so is space in memory. You should use these resources wisely, and
algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space will help you do so.
