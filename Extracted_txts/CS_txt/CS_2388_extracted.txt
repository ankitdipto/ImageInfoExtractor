Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

of algorithms. Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contempo-
rary computers.

Furthermore, with the ever-increasing capacities of computers, we use them to
solve larger problems than ever before. As we saw in the above comparison be-
tween insertion sort and merge sort, it is at larger problem sizes that the differences
in efficiency between algorithms become particularly prominent.

Having a solid base of algorithmic knowledge and technique is one characteristic
that separates the truly skilled programmers from the novices. With modern com-
puting technology, you can accomplish some tasks without knowing much about
algorithms, but with a good background in algorithms, you can do much, much
more.

Exercises

12-1
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the applica-
tion level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

12-2
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n? steps, while merge
sort runs in 64n1gn steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge
sort?

12-3
What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100?
runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2” on the same machine?

 

Problems

1-1 Comparison of running times

For each function f(7) and time ¢ in the following table, determine the largest
size n of a problem that can be solved in time f, assuming that the algorithm to
solve the problem takes f(/) microseconds.
