Chapter notes

There are many excellent texts on the general topic of algorithms, including those
by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5, 6]; Baase and Van Gelder [28]; Brassard and
Bratley [54]; Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani [82]; Goodrich and Tamassia
[148]; Hofri [175]; Horowitz, Sahni, and Rajasekaran [181]; Johnsonbaugh and
Schaefer [193]; Kingston [205]; Kleinberg and Tardos [208]; Knuth [209, 210,
211]; Kozen [220]; Levitin [235]; Manber [242]; Mehlhorn [249, 250, 251]; Pur-
dom and Brown [287]; Reingold, Nievergelt, and Deo [293]; Sedgewick [306];
Sedgewick and Flajolet [307]; Skiena [318]; and Wilf [356]. Some of the more
practical aspects of algorithm design are discussed by Bentley [42, 43] and Gonnet
[145]. Surveys of the field of algorithms can also be found in the Handbook of The-
oretical Computer Science, Volume A [342] and the CRC Algorithms and Theory of
Computation Handbook [25]. Overviews of the algorithms used in computational
biology can be found in textbooks by Gusfield [156], Pevzner [275], Setubal and
Meidanis [310], and Waterman [350].
