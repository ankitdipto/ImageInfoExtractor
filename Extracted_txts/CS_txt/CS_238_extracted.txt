28.3 Symmetric positive-definite matrices and least-squares approximation 833

prove several other important properties of symmetric positive-definite matrices
and show an interesting application to curve fitting by a least-squares approxima-
tion.

The first property we prove is perhaps the most basic.

Lemma 28.3
Any positive-definite matrix is nonsingular.

Proof Suppose that a matrix A is singular. Then by Corollary D.3, there exists a
nonzero vector x such that Ax = 0. Hence, x'Ax = 0, and A cannot be positive-
definite. /

The proof that we can perform LU decomposition on a symmetric positive-
definite matrix A without dividing by 0 is more involved. We begin by proving
properties about certain submatrices of A. Define the kth leading submatrix of A
to be the matrix A, consisting of the intersection of the first k rows and first k
columns of A.

Lemma 28.4
If A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix, then every leading submatrix of A is
symmetric and positive-definite.

Proof That each leading submatrix Ax is symmetric is obvious. To prove that Ax
is positive-definite, we assume that it is not and derive a contradiction. If Ax is not
positive-definite, then there exists a k-vector xz # 0 such that XpARXE <0. Let A
be n xn, and

A= (3 ©) (28.14)

for submatrices B (which is (n —k) xk) and C (which is (n —k) x (n—k)). Define
the n-vector x = (xj 0)", where n — k Os follow xx. Then we have

T — (xT Ay BTY\( xe
XTAX = (x 0)( BoC 0
T Akxk
(xe 0 i( Bxx
= xgAexK
< 0,

which contradicts A being positive-definite. .
