Chapter 2. Getting Started

we prefer not to get bogged down in such formalism, and so we rely on our
informal analysis to show that the second property holds for the outer loop.

Termination: Finally, we examine what happens when the loop terminates. The
condition causing the for loop to terminate is that j > A./ength =n. Because
each loop iteration increases j by 1, we must have j = n + | at that time.
Substituting n + 1 for j in the wording of loop invariant, we have that the
subarray A[1..m] consists of the elements originally in A[1..7], but in sorted
order. Observing that the subarray A[1 . . 1] is the entire array, we conclude that
the entire array is sorted. Hence, the algorithm is correct.

We shall use this method of loop invariants to show correctness later in this
chapter and in other chapters as well.

Pseudocode conventions

We use the following conventions in our pseudocode.

* Indentation indicates block structure. For example, the body of the for loop that
begins on line 1 consists of lines 2-8, and the body of the while loop that begins
on line 5 contains lines 6-7 but not line 8. Our indentation style applies to
if-else statements” as well. Using indentation instead of conventional indicators
of block structure, such as begin and end statements, greatly reduces clutter
while preserving, or even enhancing, clarity.>

* The looping constructs while, for, and repeat-until and the if-else conditional
construct have interpretations similar to those in C, C++, Java, Python, and
Pascal.’ In this book, the loop counter retains its value after exiting the loop,
unlike some situations that arise in C++, Java, and Pascal. Thus, immediately
after a for loop, the loop counter’s value is the value that first exceeded the for
loop bound. We used this property in our correctness argument for insertion
sort. The for loop header in line | is for j = 2 to A./ength, and so when
this loop terminates, 7 = A.length + 1 (or, equivalently, 7 = n + 1, since
n = A.length). We use the keyword to when a for loop increments its loop

 

2In an if-else statement, we indent else at the same level as its matching if. Although we omit the
keyword then, we occasionally refer to the portion executed when the test following if is true as a
then clause. For multiway tests, we use elseif for tests after the first one.

3£ach pseudocode procedure in this book appears on one page so that you will not have to discern
levels of indentation in code that is split across pages.

4Most block-structured languages have equivalent constructs, though the exact syntax may differ.
Python lacks repeat-until loops, and its for loops operate a little differently from the for loops in
this book.
