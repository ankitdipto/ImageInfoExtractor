Chapter 28 Matrix Operations

We now turn to some essential properties of the Schur complement. Let A be
a symmetric positive-definite matrix, and let Ay be a leading k x k submatrix
of A. Partition A once again according to equation (28.14). We generalize equa-
tion (28.9) to define the Schur complement S of A with respect to Ax as

S =C—BA;'B". (28.15)

(By Lemma 28.4, Ax is symmetric and positive-definite; therefore, Aj! exists by
Lemma 28.3, and S is well defined.) Note that our earlier definition (28.9) of the
Schur complement is consistent with equation (28.15), by letting k = 1.

The next lemma shows that the Schur-complement matrices of symmetric posi-
tive-definite matrices are themselves symmetric and positive-definite. We used this
result in Theorem 28.2, and we need its corollary to prove the correctness of LU
decomposition for symmetric positive-definite matrices.

Lemma 28.5 (Schur complement lemma)

If A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix and Ax is a leading k x k submatrix
of A, then the Schur complement S of A with respect to Ag is symmetric and
positive-definite.

Proof Because A is symmetric, so is the submatrix C. By Exercise D.2-6, the
product BA;' B" is symmetric, and by Exercise D.1-1, S is symmetric.

It remains to show that S is positive-definite. Consider the partition of A given in
equation (28.14). For any nonzero vector x, we have x7 Ax > 0 by the assumption
that A is positive-definite. Let us break x into two subvectors y and z compatible
with A, and C, respectively. Because Ay! exists, we have

by matrix magic. (Verify by multiplying through.) This last equation amounts to
“completing the square” of the quadratic form. (See Exercise 28.3-2.)

Since x7Ax > 0 holds for any nonzero x, let us pick any nonzero z and then
choose y = —A;'BTz, which causes the first term in equation (28.16) to vanish,
leaving
z(C — BA;'B")z = z'Sz
as the value of the expression. For any z # 0, we therefore have z7Sz
xTAx > 0, and thus S is positive-definite.
