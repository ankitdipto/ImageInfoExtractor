28.3 Symmetric positive-definite matrices and least-squares approximation 835

Corollary 28.6
LU decomposition of a symmetric positive-definite matrix never causes a division
by 0.

Proof Let A be a symmetric positive-definite matrix. We shall prove something
stronger than the statement of the corollary: every pivot is strictly positive. The first
pivot is aj;. Let e; be the first unit vector, from which we obtain a,, = e7 Ae; > 0.
Since the first step of LU decomposition produces the Schur complement of A
with respect to A; = (di), Lemma 28.5 implies by induction that all pivots are
positive. .

Least-squares approximation

One important application of symmetric positive-definite matrices arises in fitting
curves to given sets of data points. Suppose that we are given a set of m data points

where we know that the y; are subject to measurement errors. We would like to
determine a function F(x) such that the approximation errors

ni = F(x;)— Yi (28.17)

are small fori = 1,2,...,m. The form of the function F depends on the problem
at hand. Here, we assume that it has the form of a linearly weighted sum,

F(x) = ro fia).
j=l

where the number of summands n and the specific basis functions f; are chosen
based on knowledge of the problem at hand. A common choice is fj(x) = x/~!,
which means that

F(X) = cy + Cox + 63x? foe + enx"

is a polynomial of degree n — | in x. Thus, given m data points (x1, 1). (¥2, Y2),

By choosing n = m, we can calculate each y; exactly in equation (28.17). Such
a high-degree F “fits the noise” as well as the data, however, and generally gives
poor results when used to predict y for previously unseen values of x. It is usu-
ally better to choose 7 significantly smaller than m and hope that by choosing the
coefficients c; well, we can obtain a function F that finds the significant patterns
in the data points without paying undue attention to the noise. Some theoretical
