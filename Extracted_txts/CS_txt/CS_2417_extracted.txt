Figure 2.5 How to construct a recursion tree for the recurrence T(n) = 27(n/2) + cn.

Part (a) shows T(n), which progressively expands in (b)-(d) to form the recursion tree. The fully
expanded tree in part (d) has lgn + | levels (ice., it has height Ign, as indicated), and each level
contributes a total cost of cn. The total cost, therefore, is cm lg n + cn, which is @(nlgn).
