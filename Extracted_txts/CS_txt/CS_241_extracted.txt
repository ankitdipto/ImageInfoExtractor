Chapter 28 Matrix Operations

principles exist for choosing n, but they are beyond the scope of this text. In any
case, once we choose a value of 1 that is less than m, we end up with an overde-
termined set of equations whose solution we wish to approximate. We now show
how to do so.

Let

_ Ai.) fol%2) ++ fn (2)

denote the matrix of values of the basis functions at the given points; that is,
dij = fi (xi). Let c = (cx) denote the desired n-vector of coefficients. Then,

is the m-vector of “predicted values” for y. Thus,
n= Ac—y

is the m-vector of approximation errors.
To minimize approximation errors, we choose to minimize the norm of the error
vector 7), which gives us a least-squares solution, since

m 1/2
In = (> ") .
Because

we can minimize ||7|| by differentiating ||7||? with respect to each cz and then
setting the result to 0:
