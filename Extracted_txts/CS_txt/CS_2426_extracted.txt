Figure 3.1 Graphic examples of the ©, O, and Q notations. In each part, the value of mg shown
is the minimum possible value; any greater value would also work. (a) -notation bounds a func-
tion to within constant factors. We write f() = ©(g(n)) if there exist positive constants 19, ¢1,
and c2 such that at and to the right of 9, the value of (7) always lies between c1 g(m) and c2g(n)
inclusive. (b) O-notation gives an upper bound for a function to within a constant factor. We write
f(n) = O(g(n)) if there are positive constants no and c such that at and to the right of mo, the value
of f(n) always lies on or below cg(n). (c) Q-notation gives a lower bound for a function to within
aconstant factor. We write f(n) = Q(g(n)) if there are positive constants ng and c such that at and
to the right of mo, the value of f(n) always lies on or above cg(n).

A function f() belongs to the set ©(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c;
and c such that it can be “sandwiched” between cig(n) and c2g(n), for suffi-
ciently large n. Because O(g(n)) is a set, we could write “f(n) € O(g(n))”
to indicate that f(n) is a member of ©(g(n)). Instead, we will usually write
“f(n) = O(g(n))” to express the same notion. You might be confused because
we abuse equality in this way, but we shall see later in this section that doing so
has its advantages.

Figure 3.1(a) gives an intuitive picture of functions f(n) and g(n), where
Ff (n) = O(g(n)). For all values of n at and to the right of mo, the value of f(n)
lies at or above c; g(m) and at or below c2g(n). In other words, for all n > no, the
function f(/) is equal to g() to within a constant factor. We say that g(7) is an
asymptotically tight bound for f (n).

The definition of @(g(n)) requires that every member f(n) € O(g(n)) be
asymptotically nonnegative, that is, that f(n) be nonnegative whenever n is suf-
ficiently large. (An asymptotically positive function is one that is positive for all
sufficiently large n.) Consequently, the function g(v) itself must be asymptotically
nonnegative, or else the set @(g(n)) is empty. We shall therefore assume that every
function used within ©-notation is asymptotically nonnegative. This assumption
holds for the other asymptotic notations defined in this chapter as well.
