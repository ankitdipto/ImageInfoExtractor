Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

In Chapter 2, we introduced an informal notion of @-notation that amounted
to throwing away lower-order terms and ignoring the leading coefficient of the
highest-order term. Let us briefly justify this intuition by using the formal defi-
nition to show that $n? —3n = O(n’). To do so, we must determine positive
constants C1, C2, and Mo such that

cn? < oe —3n < con?

for all n > no. Dividing by n? yields

We can make the right-hand inequality hold for any value of n > 1 by choosing any
constant C2 > 1/2. Likewise, we can make the left-hand inequality hold for any
value of n > 7 by choosing any constant c; < 1/14. Thus, by choosing c, = 1/14,
cy = 1/2, and no = 7, we can verify that 3n? —3n = O(n’). Certainly, other
choices for the constants exist, but the important thing is that some choice exists.
Note that these constants depend on the function 3n? — 3n; a different function
belonging to ©(n?) would usually require different constants.

We can also use the formal definition to verify that 6n3? 4 ©(n?). Suppose
for the purpose of contradiction that cy and 1o exist such that 6n? < cn? for
all n > no. But then dividing by n? yields n < c2/6, which cannot possibly hold
for arbitrarily large n, since cz is constant.

Intuitively, the lower-order terms of an asymptotically positive function can be
ignored in determining asymptotically tight bounds because they are insignificant
for large n. When n is large, even a tiny fraction of the highest-order term suf-
fices to dominate the lower-order terms. Thus, setting c, to a value that is slightly
smaller than the coefficient of the highest-order term and setting cz to a value that
is slightly larger permits the inequalities in the definition of ©-notation to be sat-
isfied. The coefficient of the highest-order term can likewise be ignored, since it
only changes c; and c2 by a constant factor equal to the coefficient.

As an example, consider any quadratic function f(n) = an? + bn +c, where
a, b, and c are constants and a > 0. Throwing away the lower-order terms and
ignoring the constant yields f(n) = ©(n?). Formally, to show the same thing, we
take the constants c; = a/4, co = 7a/4, and np = 2+ max(|b| /a, /|c| /a). You
may verify that 0 < cin? < an? + bn +c < con? forall n > no. In general,
for any polynomial p(n) = yi gain, where the q; are constants and ag > 0, we
have p(n) = O(n“) (see Problem 3-1).

Since any constant is a degree-0 polynomial, we can express any constant func-
tion as @(n°), or @(1). This latter notation is a minor abuse, however, because the
