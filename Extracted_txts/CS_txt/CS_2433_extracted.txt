3.1 Asymptotic notation SI

iim 2 =0. (3.1)

Some authors use this limit as a definition of the o-notation; the definition in this
book also restricts the anonymous functions to be asymptotically nonnegative.

@-notation

By analogy, -notation is to Q-notation as o-notation is to O-notation. We use
@-notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. One way to
define it is by

Ff (n) € w(g(n)) if and only if g(n) € o( f(n)) .
Formally, however, we define w(g()) (“little-omega of g of n”) as the set
@(g(n)) = { f(n) : for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant

no > Osuch that 0 < cg(n) < f(n) forall n > no} .
For example, n?/2 = w(n), but n?/2 4 w(n). The relation f(n) = w(g(n))
implies that
lim Lo) = 00
noe gin)
if the limit exists. That is, f() becomes arbitrarily large relative to g(n) as n
approaches infinity.

Comparing functions
Many of the relational properties of real numbers apply to asymptotic comparisons
as well. For the following, assume that f(m) and g() are asymptotically positive.
Transitivity:
fn) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)) imply f(x) = O(n).
fn) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)) imply f(n) = O(h()) .
fn) = Q(g(n)) and g(n) = Q(h(n)) imply f(x) = Qn),
f(n) = o(g(n)) and g(n) = o(h(n)) imply f(r) = oh).
fn) = o(g(n)) and g(n) = o(h(n)) imply f(x) = w(h(n)).

Reflexivity:
fm) = Of).
fa) = Of n)).

fn) = Af).
