Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

Symmetry:
f(n) = O(g(n)) if and only if gin) = OCF).
Transpose symmetry:

S(n) = O(gin)) if andonly if gin) = Qf).
S(n) = o(g(n)) if andonly if gin) = a( fn).

Because these properties hold for asymptotic notations, we can draw an analogy
between the asymptotic comparison of two functions f and g and the comparison
of two real numbers a and b:

f(n) = O(g(n)) islike a<b,
fn) = Q(g(n)) islike a>b,
f(n) = O(g(n)) islike a=b,
f(n) = o(g(n))_ islike a<b,
f(n) = o(g(n)) islike a>b.
We say that f(1) is asymptotically smaller than g(n) if f(n) = o(g(n)), and f(n)
is asymptotically larger than g(n) if f(n) = @(g(n)).
One property of real numbers, however, does not carry over to asymptotic nota-
tion:

Trichotomy: For any two real numbers a and b, exactly one of the following must
hold: a < b,a =b,ora>b.

Although any two real numbers can be compared, not all functions are asymptot-
ically comparable. That is, for two functions f(n) and g(n), it may be the case
that neither f(n) = O(g(n)) nor f(n) = Q(g(n)) holds. For example, we cannot
compare the functions 7 and n'**"” using asymptotic notation, since the value of
the exponent in n'*5"” oscillates between 0 and 2, taking on all values in between.

Exercises

3.1-1
Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic defi-
nition of ©-notation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = O(f(n) + g(n)).

3.1-2
Show that for any real constants a and b, where b > 0,

(n+a)’ =0(n*). (G.2)
