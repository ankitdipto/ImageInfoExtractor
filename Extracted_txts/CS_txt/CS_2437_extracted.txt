Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

Floors and ceilings

For any real number x, we denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x by |x|
(read “the floor of x”) and the least integer greater than or equal to x by [x] (read
“the ceiling of x”). For all real x,

x-1l < [x] <x < [x] < x41. (3.3)
For any integer 7,
[n/2] + |n/2J =n,

and for any real number x > 0 and integers a,b > 0,

a] [ x 1 aay

[| _ I=. (3.5)

The floor function f(x) = Lx | is monotonically increasing, as is the ceiling func-

tion f(x) = [x].

Modular arithmetic

For any integer a and any positive integer n, the value a mod n is the remainder
(or residue) of the quotient a/n:

amodn=a-—n|a/n| . (3.8)
It follows that
0<amodn<n. (3.9)

Given a well-defined notion of the remainder of one integer when divided by an-
other, it is convenient to provide special notation to indicate equality of remainders.
If (a mod n) = (b mod n), we write a = b (mod n) and say that a is equivalent
to b, modulo n. In other words, a = b (mod n) if a and b have the same remain-
der when divided by n. Equivalently, a = b (mod n) if and only if n is a divisor
of b—a. We write a # b (mod n) if a is not equivalent to b, modulo n.
