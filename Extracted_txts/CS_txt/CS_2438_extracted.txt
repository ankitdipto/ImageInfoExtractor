Polynomials

Given a nonnegative integer d, a polynomial in n of degree d is a function p(n)
of the form

d
pn) = oan,
i=0
where the constants do,dj,..., aq are the coefficients of the polynomial and

aa #0. A polynomial is asymptotically positive if and only if ag > 0. For an
asymptotically positive polynomial p(n) of degree d, we have p(n) = @(n“). For
any real constant a > 0, the function n“ is monotonically increasing, and for any
real constant a < 0, the function n“ is monotonically decreasing. We say that a
function f(n) is polynomially bounded if f(n) = O(n*) for some constant k.

Exponentials

For all real a > 0, m, and n, we have the following identities:

a= 1,
1
=a,

a! = l/a,
ay" = am
ay = ayn,
a™a" = qu‘ .

For all n and a > 1, the function a” is monotonically increasing in n. When
convenient, we shall assume 0° = 1.

We can relate the rates of growth of polynomials and exponentials by the fol-
lowing fact. For all real constants a and b such that a > 1,

lim — =0, (3.10)
from which we can conclude that
n° =o(a").
Thus, any exponential function with a base strictly greater than 1 grows faster than
any polynomial function.

Using e to denote 2.71828..., the base of the natural logarithm function, we
have for all real x,
