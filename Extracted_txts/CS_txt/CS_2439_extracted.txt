Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

where “!” denotes the factorial function defined later in this section. For all real x,
we have the inequality

e>l+x, (3.12)
where equality holds only when x = 0. When |x| < 1, we have the approximation
l+x<e*<1l4+x4x?. (3.13)

When x —> 0, the approximation of e* by 1 + x is quite good:
eX =14+x+O0(x?).

(In this equation, the asymptotic notation is used to describe the limiting behavior
as x — O rather than as x — 00.) We have for all x,

lim (1+=)" =e". (3.14)

Logarithms
We shall use the following notations:
Ign = log ,n (binary logarithm) ,
Inn = log,n (natural logarithm) ,
Ig*n = (Ign)* (exponentiation) ,
Iglgn = Ig(lgn) (composition) .

An important notational convention we shall adopt is that Jogarithm functions will
apply only to the next term in the formula, so that lgn + k will mean (lgn) + k
and not Ig(n +k). If we hold b > 1 constant, then for n > 0, the function log, n
is strictly increasing.

For all reala > 0,b > 0,c > 0, andn,

 

a = prena,
log.(ab) = log,a+log.b.
