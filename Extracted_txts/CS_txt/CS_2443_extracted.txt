3.2 Standard notations and common functions 59

Since the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be about 10°°,
which is much less than 2°°*3°, we rarely encounter an input size 7 such that
Ig*n > 5.

Fibonacci numbers

We define the Fibonacci numbers by the following recurrence:

Fo = 0,
F, = 1, (3.22)
Fo = Fit. fori=2.

Thus, each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous ones, yielding the
sequence

0. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,2...

Fibonacci numbers are related to the golden ratio ¢ and to its conjugate ¢, which
are the two roots of the equation

rax+l (3.23)

and are given by the following formulas (see Exercise 3.2-6):

Specifically, we have
