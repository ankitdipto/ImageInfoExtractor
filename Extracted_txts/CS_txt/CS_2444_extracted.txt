Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

R= \% + 3| . (3.25)

which is to say that the ith Fibonacci number F; is equal to ¢'/ /5 rounded to the
nearest integer. Thus, Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially.

Exercises

3.2-1

Show that if f(m) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions, then so are
the functions f(n) + g(m) and f(g(n)), and if f(m) and g(n) are in addition
nonnegative, then f(7)- g() is monotonically increasing.

3.2-2
Prove equation (3.16).

3.2-3
Prove equation (3.19). Also prove that n! = (2") and n! = o(n").

3.2-4 x
Is the function [lg 7]! polynomially bounded? Is the function [lg 1gn]! polynomi-
ally bounded?

32-5 *
Which is asymptotically larger: lg(Ig* 7) or lg* (Ign)?

3.2-6
Show that the golden ratio @ and its conjugate @ both satisfy the equation
wextl

3.2-7

Prove by induction that the ith Fibonacci number satisfies the equality
i Ai

F= 9 :

 

5S

where @ is the golden ratio and ¢ is its conjugate.

3.2-8
