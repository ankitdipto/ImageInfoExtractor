3-1 Asymptotic behavior of polynomials
Let

d
p(n) = Yan :
i=0

where ag > 0, be a degree-d polynomial in n, and let k be a constant. Use the
definitions of the asymptotic notations to prove the following properties.

a. If k = d, then p(n) = O(n*).
b. fk < d, then p(n) = Q(n*).
c. Ifk =d, then p(n) = O(n’).
d. Ifk > d, then p(n) = o(n*).

e. Ifk <d, then p(n) = w(n*).

3-2 Relative asymptotic growths

Indicate, for each pair of expressions (A, B) in the table below, whether A is O, 0,
Q, w, or © of B. Assume that k > 1,€ > 0, and c > 1 are constants. Your answer
should be in the form of the table with “yes” or “no” written in each box.

3-3 Ordering by asymptotic growth rates

a. Rank the following functions by order of growth; that is, find an arrangement
Zi. S200, £30 of the functions satisfying gi = Q(g2), go = Q(gs), -..,
29 = Q(g30). Partition your list into equivalence classes such that functions
Ff (n) and g(n) are in the same class if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)).
