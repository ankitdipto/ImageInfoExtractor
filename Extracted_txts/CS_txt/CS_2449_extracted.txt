Problems for Chapter 3 63

b. Describe the potential advantages and disadvantages of using & instead of Q to
characterize the running times of programs.

Some authors also define O in a slightly different manner; let’s use O’ for the
alternative definition. We say that f(n) = O’(g(n)) if and only if | f(n)| =
O(g(n)).

c. What happens to each direction of the “if and only if” in Theorem 3.1 if we
substitute O’ for O but still use Q?

Some authors define O (read “soft-oh”) to mean O with logarithmic factors ig-
nored:

O(g(n)) = {f(n) : there exist positive constants c,k, and no such that
0<f(n< cg(n) lg*(n) for alln > no}.

d. Define & and © ina similar manner. Prove the corresponding analog to Theo-
rem 3.1.

3-6 Iterated functions

We can apply the iteration operator * used in the lg* function to any monotonically
increasing function f(/) over the reals. For a given constant c € R, we define the
iterated function f;* by

fe(n) = min fi > 0: fOM) <c},

which need not be well defined in all cases. In other words, the quantity f;*(”) is
the number of iterated applications of the function f required to reduce its argu-
ment down to c or less.

For each of the following functions f(n) and constants c, give as tight a bound
as possible on f,*(11).
