64 Chapter 3 Growth of Functions

 

Chapter notes

Knuth [209] traces the origin of the O-notation to a number-theory text by P. Bach-
mann in 1892. The o-notation was invented by E. Landau in 1909 for his discussion
of the distribution of prime numbers. The Q and © notations were advocated by
Knuth [213] to correct the popular, but technically sloppy, practice in the literature
of using O-notation for both upper and lower bounds. Many people continue to
use the O-notation where the ©-notation is more technically precise. Further dis-
cussion of the history and development of asymptotic notations appears in works
by Knuth [209, 213] and Brassard and Bratley [54].

Not all authors define the asymptotic notations in the same way, although the
various definitions agree in most common situations. Some of the alternative def-
initions encompass functions that are not asymptotically nonnegative, as long as
their absolute values are appropriately bounded.

Equation (3.20) is due to Robbins [297]. Other properties of elementary math-
ematical functions can be found in any good mathematical reference, such as
Abramowitz and Stegun [1] or Zwillinger [362], or in a calculus book, such as
Apostol [18] or Thomas et al. [334]. Knuth [209] and Graham, Knuth, and Patash-
nik [152] contain a wealth of material on discrete mathematics as used in computer
science.
