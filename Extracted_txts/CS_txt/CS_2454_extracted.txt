4.1 The maximum-subarray problem

Suppose that you been offered the opportunity to invest in the Volatile Chemical
Corporation. Like the chemicals the company produces, the stock price of the
Volatile Chemical Corporation is rather volatile. You are allowed to buy one unit
of stock only one time and then sell it at a later date, buying and selling after the
close of trading for the day. To compensate for this restriction, you are allowed to
learn what the price of the stock will be in the future. Your goal is to maximize
your profit. Figure 4.1 shows the price of the stock over a 17-day period. You
may buy the stock at any one time, starting after day 0, when the price is $100
per share. Of course, you would want to “buy low, sell high” —buy at the lowest
possible price and later on sell at the highest possible price—to maximize your
profit. Unfortunately, you might not be able to buy at the lowest price and then sell
at the highest price within a given period. In Figure 4.1, the lowest price occurs
after day 7, which occurs after the highest price, after day 1.

You might think that you can always maximize profit by either buying at the
lowest price or selling at the highest price. For example, in Figure 4.1, we would
maximize profit by buying at the lowest price, after day 7. If this strategy always
worked, then it would be easy to determine how to maximize profit: find the highest
and lowest prices, and then work left from the highest price to find the lowest prior
price, work right from the lowest price to find the highest later price, and take
the pair with the greater difference. Figure 4.2 shows a simple counterexample,
