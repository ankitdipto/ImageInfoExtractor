28.3 Symmetric positive-definite matrices and least-squares approximation 839

F(x) = 1.200 —0.757x + 0.214x?

as the closest-fitting quadratic to the given data, in a least-squares sense.

As a practical matter, we solve the normal equation (28.19) by multiplying y
by AT and then finding an LU decomposition of ATA. If A has full rank, the
matrix ATA is guaranteed to be nonsingular, because it is symmetric and positive-
definite. (See Exercise D.1-2 and Theorem D.6.)

Exercises

28.3-1
Prove that every diagonal element of a symmetric positive-definite matrix is posi-
tive.

28.3-2 b
Let A = (j c ) be a 2 x 2 symmetric positive-definite matrix. Prove that its

determinant ac — b? is positive by “completing the square” in a manner similar to
that used in the proof of Lemma 28.5.

28.3-3
Prove that the maximum element in a symmetric positive-definite matrix lies on
the diagonal.

28.3-4
Prove that the determinant of each leading submatrix of a symmetric positive-
definite matrix is positive.

28.3-5

Let Ax denote the kth leading submatrix of a symmetric positive-definite matrix A.
Prove that det(A,)/ det(A_,) is the kth pivot during LU decomposition, where,
by convention, det(Ao) = 1.

28.3-6
Find the function of the form

F(x) =c1 + 2x lgx +c3e*
that is the best least-squares fit to the data points

(1, 1), (2, 1), 3.3), (4,8) .
