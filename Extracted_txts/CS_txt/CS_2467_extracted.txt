2. Apply the data bits that must be stored in memory into the data input
lines.

3. Activate the write input.

The memory unit will then take the bits presently available in the input data
lines and store them in the word specified by the address lines.

The steps that must be taken forthe purpose of transferring a stored word.
out of memory are as follows:

1. Apply the binary address of the desired word into the address lines.
2. Activate the read input.

The memory unit will then take the bits from the word that has been selected
by the address and apply them into the output data lines. The content of the
selected word does not change after reading.

Read-Only Memory

As the name implies, a read-only memory (ROM) is a memory unit that
performs the read operation only; it does not have a write capability. This
implies that the binary information stored in a ROMis made permanent during
the hardware production of the unit and cannot be altered by writing different
words into it. Whereas a RAM is a general-purpose device whose contents can
be altered during the computational process, a ROM is restricted to reading
words that are permanently stored within the unit. The binary information to
be stored, specified by the designer, is then embedded in the unit to form the
required interconnection pattern. ROMs come with special internal electronic
fuses that can be” programmed” for a specific configuration. Once the pattern
is established, it stays within the unit even when power is turned off and on
again.
