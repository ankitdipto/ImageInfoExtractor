(Atay? = ATA,

 

Problems

28-1 Tridiagonal systems of linear equations
Consider the tridiagonal matrix

1-1 0 0 0

-l 2-1 0 0

A= 0 -l 2-1 #0
0 o-l 2-1

0 0 0-1 2

a. Find an LU decomposition of A.

b. Solve the equation Ax =(1 1 1 1 1 y" by using forward and back sub-
stitution.

c. Find the inverse of A.

d. Show how, for any n x n symmetric positive-definite, tridiagonal matrix A and
any n-vector b, to solve the equation Ax = b in O(n) time by performing an
LU decomposition. Argue that any method based on forming A™! is asymptot-
ically more expensive in the worst case.

e. Show how, for any x7 nonsingular, tridiagonal matrix A and any n-vector b, to
solve the equation Ax = b in O(n) time by performing an LUP decomposition.

28-2 Splines

A practical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use cu-
bic splines. We are given a set {(x;, yj): i =0.1..... n} of n + 1 point-value
pairs, where X» < X; < +++ < Xp. We wish to fit a piecewise-cubic curve
(spline) f(x) to the points. That is, the curve f(x) is made up of n cubic polyno-
mials f;(x) = a; + b;x + ¢;x? + d;x3 fori =0,1,...,1 — 1, where if x falls in
