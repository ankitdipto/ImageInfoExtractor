Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer

We have traded off one matrix multiplication for a constant number of matrix ad-
ditions. Once we understand recurrences and their solutions, we shall see that this
tradeoff actually leads to a lower asymptotic running time. By the master method
in Section 4.5, recurrence (4.18) has the solution T(n) = @(n'27).

We now proceed to describe the details. In step 2, we create the following 10
matrices:

Sy = By-Bn,
Sy = Ant+Arn.
S39 = Ari + Arr.
So = Ba-Bu.
Ss = Aut A22,
Sos = But Bn.
S7 = Ap—An.
Ss = Bat Bn.
Sy = Ay—An.

Si = ButBr.
Since we must add or subtract n/2 x n/2 matrices 10 times, this step does indeed
take @(n7) time.

Instep 3, we recursively multiply n/2xn/2 matrices seven times to compute the
following n/2 x n/2 matrices, each of which is the sum or difference of products
of A and B submatrices:

Py = Ay-S, = Ay+ By Ain: Boo.
Py = S2- Boy = Au Bo + Aia- Bo .

P3 = S3-Buy = An Bu t+ A22- Bu.
Py = An-Sy = Ara Bor— Ar: Bi.
Ps = Ss-Sp = Ay: Buy + Air+ Boz + Azo» By + Ao + Boo .
Po = S7-Sg = Ajp+ Boy + Aia> Boy — Ana + Boy — An: By .

Py = So-Sio = An- Bu t+ Au Bi — Ar Bu — Arr: Br.

Note that the only multiplications we need to perform are those in the middle col-
umn of the above equations. The right-hand column just shows what these products
equal in terms of the original submatrices created in step 1.

Step 4 adds and subtracts the P; matrices created in step 3 to construct the four
n/2 x n/2 submatrices of the product C. We start with

Cu = Ps+ Py—P2+ Po.
