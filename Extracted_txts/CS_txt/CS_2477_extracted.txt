4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences 87

which is very much like recurrence (4.19). Indeed, this new recurrence has the
same solution: S(m) = O(m lgm). Changing back from S(m) to T(1), we obtain

T(n) = T(2”) = S(m) = O(mlgm) = Ollgnlgign) .

Exercises

43-1
Show that the solution of T(n) = T(n — 1) +n is O(n?).

43-2
Show that the solution of T(n) = T([n/2]) + lis O(gn).

43-3
We saw that the solution of T(n) = 2T([n/2]) +n is O(nlgn). Show that the so-
lution of this recurrence is also Q(nlgn). Conclude that the solution is O(n Ign).

4.3-4

Show that by making a different inductive hypothesis, we can overcome the diffi-
culty with the boundary condition T(1) = 1| for recurrence (4.19) without adjusting
the boundary conditions for the inductive proof.

43-5
Show that @(7 1g 7) is the solution to the “exact” recurrence (4.3) for merge sort.

43-6
Show that the solution to T(n) = 27 ({n/2| + 17) +n is O(nlgn).

4.3-7

Using the master method in Section 4.5, you can show that the solution to the
recurrence T(n) = 47 (n/3) +n is T(n) = ©(n'°834). Show that a substitution
proof with the assumption T(n) < cn'°:34 fails. Then show how to subtract off a
lower-order term to make a substitution proof work.

4.3-8

Using the master method in Section 4.5, you can show that the solution to the
recurrence T(n) = 47(n/2) + n? is T(n) = ©(n?). Show that a substitution
proof with the assumption T(n) < cn? fails. Then show how to subtract off a
lower-order term to make a substitution proof work.
