4.5. The master method for solving recurrences 95

That is, f(”) must be asymptotically smaller than n'°8>“ by a factor of n* for some
constant € > 0. In the third case, not only must f (7) be larger than n'°20“, it also
must be polynomially larger and in addition satisfy the “regularity” condition that
af(n/b) < cf(n). This condition is satisfied by most of the polynomially bounded
functions that we shall encounter.

Note that the three cases do not cover all the possibilities for f(n). There is
a gap between cases | and 2 when f(r) is smaller than n'°®“ but not polynomi-
ally smaller. Similarly, there is a gap between cases 2 and 3 when f(n) is larger
than n'°%>@ but not polynomially larger. If the function (1) falls into one of these
gaps, or if the regularity condition in case 3 fails to hold, you cannot use the master
method to solve the recurrence.

Using the master method

To use the master method, we simply determine which case (if any) of the master
theorem applies and write down the answer.
As a first example, consider

T(n) = 9T(n/3) +n.
For this recurrence, we have a = 9, b = 3, f(n) = n, and thus we have that
nen 4 = n'83° = O(n). Since f(n) = O(n'®39-£), where € = 1, we can apply

case | of the master theorem and conclude that the solution is T(n) = @(n?).
Now consider

T(n) = T(2n/3) +1,

in which a = 1,b = 3/2, f(n) = 1, and n%4 = ness! = n° = 1. Case 2
applies, since f(n) = @(n'°**) = (1), and thus the solution to the recurrence
is T(n) = O(lgn).

For the recurrence
T(n) = 3T(n/4) +-nlgn,
we havea = 3,b = 4, f(n) = nign, and n4 = nhs} = O(n®793),
Since f(n) = Q(n'243**), where € ~ 0.2, case 3 applies if we can show that
the regularity condition holds for f(n). For sufficiently large n, we have that
af(n/b) = 3(n/4) lg(n/4) < (3/4)nlgn = cf(n) for c = 3/4. Consequently,
by case 3, the solution to the recurrence is T(n) = O(n Ign).

The master method does not apply to the recurrence

T(n) = 2T(n/2) +nlgn,

even though it appears to have the proper form: a = 2,b = 2, f(n) = nlgn,
and n'°%»¢ = n. You might mistakenly think that case 3 should apply, since
