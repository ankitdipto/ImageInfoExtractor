4.6 Proof of the master theorem 97

4.5-2

Professor Caesar wishes to develop a matrix-multiplication algorithm that is
asymptotically faster than Strassen’s algorithm. His algorithm will use the divide-
and-conquer method, dividing each matrix into pieces of size n/4 x n/4, and the
divide and combine steps together will take ©(n?) time. He needs to determine
how many subproblems his algorithm has to create in order to beat Strassen’s algo-
rithm. If his algorithm creates a subproblems, then the recurrence for the running
time T(n) becomes T(n) = aT(n/4) + ©(n?). What is the largest integer value
of a for which Professor Caesar’s algorithm would be asymptotically faster than
Strassen’s algorithm?

4.5-3

Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence
T(n) = T(n/2) + ©(1) is Tin) = O(lgn). (See Exercise 2.3-5 for a description
of binary search.)

4.5-4
Can the master method be applied to the recurrence T(n) = 47 (n/2) + n? Ign?
Why or why not? Give an asymptotic upper bound for this recurrence.

45-5 *

Consider the regularity condition af(n/b) < cf(n) for some constant c < 1,
which is part of case 3 of the master theorem. Give an example of constants a > 1
and b > | and a function f(m) that satisfies all the conditions in case 3 of the
master theorem except the regularity condition.

 

* 4.6 Proof of the master theorem

This section contains a proof of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1). You do not
need to understand the proof in order to apply the master theorem.

The proof appears in two parts. The first part analyzes the master recur-
rence (4.20), under the simplifying assumption that T(m) is defined only on ex-
act powers of b > 1, that is, forn = 1,b,b?,.... This part gives all the intuition
needed to understand why the master theorem is true. The second part shows how
to extend the analysis to all positive integers 1; it applies mathematical technique
to the problem of handling floors and ceilings.

In this section, we shall sometimes abuse our asymptotic notation slightly by
using it to describe the behavior of functions that are defined only over exact
powers of b. Recall that the definitions of asymptotic notations require that
