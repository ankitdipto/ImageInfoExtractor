Problems for Chapter 28 841

the range x; < x < x;+1, then the value of the curve is given by f(x) = fi(x—x;).
The points x; at which the cubic polynomials are “pasted” together are called knots.

For simplicity, we shall assume that x; =i fori = 0,1,..., n.
To ensure continuity of f(x), we require that
fi) = fi) = yi.
fQie) = fi) = yin
fori = 0,1,..., n—1. Toensure that f(x) is sufficiently smooth, we also insist

that the first derivative be continuous at each knot:

f'Qi+) = fi) = fi)
fori =0,1,....n—2.

a. Suppose that fori = 0,1,...,m, we are given not only the point-value pairs
{(x;, y;)} but also the first derivatives D; = f'(x;) at each knot. Express each
coefficient a;, b;, c;, and d; in terms of the values y;, y;4:, D;, and D; +1.
(Remember that x; = 7.) How quickly can we compute the 4n coefficients
from the point-value pairs and first derivatives?

The question remains of how to choose the first derivatives of f(x) at the knots.

One method is to require the second derivatives to be continuous at the knots:

f' Cia) = HD = f/i10)

fori = 0,1,...,2 —2. At the first and last knots, we assume that f”(X%) =

So 0) = Oand f"(x) = f/",(1) = 0; these assumptions make f(x) a natural

cubic spline.

b. Use the continuity constraints on the second derivative to show that fori =
1,2,..., n—-1,

Dj-1 + 4D; + Dis = 3(Vi41 — Yi-1) - (28.21)

c. Show that
2Do+Di = 3(yi-Yyo). (28.22)
Dy-1+2Dn = 3(Yn = Yn-1) - (28.23)

d. Rewrite equations (28.21)-(28.23) as a matrix equation involving the vector
D=(Dpo,D\..... D,,) of unknowns. What attributes does the matrix in your
equation have?

e. Argue that a natural cubic spline can interpolate a set of nm + 1 point-value pairs
in O(n) time (see Problem 28-1).
