Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer

cost of all the leaves, which is the cost of doing all nen subproblems of size 1,
is O(n! 4), .

In terms of the recursion tree, the three cases of the master theorem correspond
to cases in which the total cost of the tree is (1) dominated by the costs in the
leaves, (2) evenly distributed among the levels of the tree, or (3) dominated by the
cost of the root.

The summation in equation (4.21) describes the cost of the dividing and com-
bining steps in the underlying divide-and-conquer algorithm. The next lemma pro-
vides asymptotic bounds on the summation’s growth.

Lemma 4.3
Let a > 1 and b > 1 be constants, and let f(m) be a nonnegative function defined
on exact powers of b. A function g(m) defined over exact powers of b by

logy n—1

g(n)= > al f(n/b!) (4.22)

j=0
has the following asymptotic bounds for exact powers of b:

1. If f(n) = O(n'®+ 4) for some constant € > 0, then g(7) = O(n'°%¢),
2. If f(n) = O(n'™>4), then g(n) = O(n! 4 Ign).

3. Ifaf(n/b) < cf(n) for some constant c < | and for all sufficiently large n,
then g(n) = O( f(n)).

Proof For case 1, we have f(n) = O(n'°%»¢~*), which implies that f(n/b/) =
O((n/b/)'2» &-), Substituting into equation (4.22) yields

We bound the summation within the O-notation by factoring out terms and simpli-
fying, which leaves an increasing geometric series:
