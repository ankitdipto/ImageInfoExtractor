Since b and € are constants, we can rewrite the last expression as n'°%» @~€ O(n*) =
O(n'2>“). Substituting this expression for the summation in equation (4.23) yields

a(n) = O(n"**)

 

thereby proving case 1.
Because case 2 assumes that f(7) = ©(n'°%*), we have that f(n/b/) =
O((n/b/)"%), Substituting into equation (4.22) yields

log), n—1 cep @
a) -0( s = (5) " ) : (4.24)

We bound the summation within the @-notation as in case 1, but this time we do not
obtain a geometric series. Instead, we discover that every term of the summation
is the same:

logy n=1 logy n—1

= n%“log,n.
Substituting this expression for the summation in equation (4.24) yields

gin) = O(n“ log, n)
O(n" Ign) ,

proving case 2.

We prove case 3 similarly. Since /() appears in the definition (4.22) of g(n)
and all terms of g(”) are nonnegative, we can conclude that g(n) = Q( f(n)) for
exact powers of b. We assume in the statement of the lemma that af(n/b) < cf (n)
for some constant c < 1 and all sufficiently large n. We rewrite this assumption
as f(n/b) < (c/a) f(n) and iterate j times, yielding f(n/b/) < (c/a)/ f(n) or,
equivalently, a/ f(n/b/) < c/ f(n), where we assume that the values we iterate
on are sufficiently large. Since the last, and smallest, such value is n/bi-, it is
enough to assume that 1 /b/~ is sufficiently large.

Substituting into equation (4.22) and simplifying yields a geometric series, but
unlike the series in case 1, this one has decreasing terms. We use an O(1) term to
