since c is a constant. Thus, we can conclude that g(n) = O(f(n)) for exact powers
of b. With case 3 proved, the proof of the lemma is complete. .

We can now prove a version of the master theorem for the case in which n is an
exact power of b.

Lemma 4.4
Let a > 1 and b > 1 be constants, and let f(m) be a nonnegative function defined
on exact powers of b. Define T(n) on exact powers of b by the recurrence

ec) ifn =1,

TO) = aT(n/b)+ f(n) ifn =b',

where i is a positive integer. Then T() has the following asymptotic bounds for
exact powers of b:

1. If f(n) = O(n'*® **) for some constant € > 0, then T(n) = O(n! 4).
2. If f(r) = O(n*»4), then T(n) = O(n 4 Ign).

3. If f(n) = Q(n'°8»4**) for some constant € > 0, and if af(n/b) < cf(n) for
some constant c < | and all sufficiently large n, then T(n) = O(f(n)).

Proof We use the bounds in Lemma 4.3 to evaluate the summation (4.21) from
Lemma 4.2. For case 1, we have
T(n) = @(n'®*) + O(n'®*)
