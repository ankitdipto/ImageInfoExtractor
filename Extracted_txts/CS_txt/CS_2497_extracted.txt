and for case 2,

T(n) = O(n'®*) + O(n" “ Ign)
= O(n“ Ign).

For case 3,

Tin) = O(n“) + O(f(n))
= Of).

because f (1) = Q(n'8» 4+), 7

4.6.2 Floors and ceilings

To complete the proof of the master theorem, we must now extend our analysis to
the situation in which floors and ceilings appear in the master recurrence, so that
the recurrence is defined for all integers, not for just exact powers of b. Obtaining
a lower bound on

T(n) = aT ({n/b)) + f(n) (4.25)
and an upper bound on
T(n) = aT (\n/b]) + f@) (4.26)

is routine, since we can push through the bound [n/b] > n/b in the first case to
yield the desired result, and we can push through the bound [n/b| < n/b in the
second case. We use much the same technique to lower-bound the recurrence (4.26)
as to upper-bound the recurrence (4.25), and so we shall present only this latter
bound.

We modify the recursion tree of Figure 4.7 to produce the recursion tree in Fig-
ure 4.8. As we go down in the recursion tree, we obtain a sequence of recursive
invocations on the arguments

n,

[n/b] .

[[n/b] /b] .
[Tfn/b]/b] /b] .

Let us denote the j th element in the sequence by n;, where

n ifj =0.

an [nja/b] iff >0. (4.27)
