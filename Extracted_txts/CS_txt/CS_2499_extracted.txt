and thus we see that at depth [log, 1], the problem size is at most a constant.
From Figure 4.8, we see that

which is much the same as equation (4.21), except that is an arbitrary integer and
not restricted to be an exact power of b.
We can now evaluate the summation

Llog, nJ—1 |
gin)= Yo ai f(y) (4.29)

from equation (4.28) in a manner analogous to the proof of Lemma 4.3. Beginning
with case 3, ifaf([n/b]) < cf(n) forn > b+b/(b—1), where c < lis aconstant,
then it follows that a/ f(n;) < c/ f(n). Therefore, we can evaluate the sum in
equation (4.29) just as in Lemma 4.3. For case 2, we have f(n) = O(n'°2“). If we
can show that f(n;) = O(n! /a/) = O((n/b/)'°8“), then the proof for case 2
of Lemma 4.3 will go through. Observe that j < [log, | implies b//n < 1. The
bound f(n) = O(n'*®»“) implies that there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all
sufficiently large nj;,
