Chapter 28 Matrix Operations

f. Show how to determine a natural cubic spline that interpolates a set of n + 1
points (x;, y;) satisfying Xp < x; <--++ < X,, even when x; is not necessarily
equal to 7. What matrix equation must your method solve, and how quickly
does your algorithm run?

 

Chapter notes

Many excellent texts describe numerical and scientific computation in much greater
detail than we have room for here. The following are especially readable: George
and Liu [132], Golub and Van Loan [144], Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flan-
nery [283, 284], and Strang [323, 324].

Golub and Van Loan [144] discuss numerical stability. They show why det(A)
is not necessarily a good indicator of the stability of a matrix A, proposing instead
to use || Al], ||A7!||o. where ||A]],, = maxici<n Ya |aiz|. They also address
the question of how to compute this value without actually computing A~.

Gaussian elimination, upon which the LU and LUP decompositions are based,
was the first systematic method for solving linear systems of equations. It was also
one of the earliest numerical algorithms. Although it was known earlier, its dis-
covery is commonly attributed to C. F. Gauss (1777-1855). In his famous paper
[325], Strassen showed that an 7 x n matrix can be inverted in O(n'£7) time. Wino-
grad [358] originally proved that matrix multiplication is no harder than matrix
inversion, and the converse is due to Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5].

Another important matrix decomposition is the singular value decomposition,
or SVD. The SVD factors an m x n matrix A into A = Q,2Q3, where © is an
mn matrix with nonzero values only on the diagonal, Q; is m x m with mutually
orthonormal columns, and Q, is n x 1, also with mutually orthonormal columns.
Two vectors are orthonormal if their inner product is 0 and each vector has a norm
of 1. The books by Strang [323, 324] and Golub and Van Loan [144] contain good
treatments of the SVD.

Strang [324] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-definite matri-
ces and of linear algebra in general.
