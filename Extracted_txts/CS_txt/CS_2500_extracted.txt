since c(1 + b/(b — 1))'85“ is a constant. Thus, we have proved case 2. The proof
of case 1 is almost identical. The key is to prove the bound f(nj) = O(n'°»4~*),
which is similar to the corresponding proof of case 2, though the algebra is more
intricate.

We have now proved the upper bounds in the master theorem for all integers n.
The proof of the lower bounds is similar.

Exercises

4.6-1 x
Give a simple and exact expression for n; in equation (4.27) for the case in which b
is a positive integer instead of an arbitrary real number.

46-2 *

Show that if f(n) = O(n!» 1g n), where k > 0, then the master recurrence has
solution T(n) = @(n'°2 4 Igkt n). For simplicity, confine your analysis to exact
powers of b.

46-3 *

Show that case 3 of the master theorem is overstated, in the sense that the regularity
condition af(n/b) < cf(n) for some constant c < 1 implies that there exists a
constant € > 0 such that f(m) = Q(n'%4**),
