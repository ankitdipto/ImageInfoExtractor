clear.

Construct a 5-to-32-line decoder with four 3-to-8-line decoders with enable

and one 2-to-4+line decoder. Use block diagrams similar to Fig. 2-3.

Draw the logic diagram of a 2-to-4line decoder with only NOR gates.

Include an enable input.

‘Modify the decoder of Fig. 2-2 so that the circuits enabled when E = land

disabled when E = 0. List the modified truth table

[Draw the logic diagram ofan eight-input, three-output encoder whose truth

table is given inTable 2-2. What is the output when all the inputs are

to 0? What is the output when only input D, is equal to 0? Establish a

procedure that will distinguish between these two cases.

Construct a 16-to-1-line multiplexer with two 8-to-I-line multiplexers and

one 2-to-Lline multiplexer. Use block diagrams for the three multiplexers.

Draw the block diagram of a dual 4-to-I-line multiplexers and explain its

operation by means of a function table.

Include a twoinput AND gate withthe register of Fig 2-6and connect the

‘gate output to the clock inputs of all the flip-flops. One input of the AND

gate receives the dock pulses from the clock pulse generator. The other input

of the AND gate provides a parallel load control. Explain the operation of

the modified register.

‘What is the purpose of the buffer gate in the clock input of the register of

Fig. 27?

Include a synchronous dear capability to the register with parallel load of

Fig. 27.

‘The content of a4-bitregister is initially 1101. The registeris shifted six times

to the right with the serial input being 101101. What is the content of the

register after each shift?

‘What is the difference between serial and parallel transfer? Using a shift

register with parallel load, explain how toconvert serialinput data to parallel

‘output and parallel input data to serial output.

ring counter isa shift register as in Fig. 28 with the serialoutput connected

to the serial input. Starting from an inital state of 1000, list the sequence of

states of the four flip-flops after each shift.

‘The 4-bit bidirectional shift register with parallel load shown in Fig. 2-9 is

enclosed within one IC package.

a. Draw a block diagram of the IC showingall inputs and outputs. Include
two pins for power supply.

'b. Draw a block diagram using two ICsto produce an 8-bit bidirectional shift
register with parallel load.

How many flip-flops will be complemented in a 10-bit binary counter to

reach the next count after (a) 1001100111; (b) 0011111111?
