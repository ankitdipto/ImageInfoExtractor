Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer

Consider the problem of finding a single good chip from among n chips, as-
suming that more than 1/2 of the chips are good. Show that [n/2| pairwise
tests are sufficient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.

Show that the good chips can be identified with @(7) pairwise tests, assuming
that more than 1/2 of the chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that
describes the number of tests.

4-6 Monge arrays
An m x n array A of real numbers is a Monge array if for all i, j,k, and / such
that 1 <i <k <mand1 <j </ <n, we have

Afi, j] + A[k.1] < Ali./] + Ak. 7].

In other words, whenever we pick two rows and two columns of a Monge array and
consider the four elements at the intersections of the rows and the columns, the sum
of the upper-left and lower-right elements is less than or equal to the sum of the
lower-left and upper-right elements. For example, the following array is Monge:

10
17
24

45
36

a. Prove that an array is Monge if and only if for all i = 1,2,....m —1 and
Jj =1,2,...,n —1, we have

Ali, j)+Ali+ 1.7 +1 < 4f.7 +10 +4) +1, J].

(Hint: For the “if” part, use induction separately on rows and columns.)

b. The following array is not Monge. Change one element in order to make it
Monge. (Hint: Use part (a).)
