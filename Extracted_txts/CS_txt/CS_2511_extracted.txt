5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized
Algorithms

This chapter introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. If you
are unfamiliar with the basics of probability theory, you should read Appendix C,
which reviews this material. We shall revisit probabilistic analysis and randomized
algorithms several times throughout this book.

 

5.1 The hiring problem

Suppose that you need to hire a new office assistant. Your previous attempts at
hiring have been unsuccessful, and you decide to use an employment agency. The
employment agency sends you one candidate each day. You interview that person
and then decide either to hire that person or not. You must pay the employment
agency a small fee to interview an applicant. To actually hire an applicant is more
costly, however, since you must fire your current office assistant and pay a substan-
tial hiring fee to the employment agency. You are committed to having, at all times,
the best possible person for the job. Therefore, you decide that, after interviewing
each applicant, if that applicant is better qualified than the current office assistant,
you will fire the current office assistant and hire the new applicant. You are willing
to pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate what that price
will be.

The procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, given below, expresses this strategy for hiring
in pseudocode. It assumes that the candidates for the office assistant job are num-
bered | through n. The procedure assumes that you are able to, after interviewing
candidate i, determine whether candidate i is the best candidate you have seen so
far. To initialize, the procedure creates a dummy candidate, numbered 0, who is
less qualified than each of the other candidates.
