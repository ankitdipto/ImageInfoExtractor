5.2 Indicator random variables

In order to analyze many algorithms, including the hiring problem, we use indicator
random variables. Indicator random variables provide a convenient method for
converting between probabilities and expectations. Suppose we are given a sample
space S and an event A. Then the indicator random variable | { A} associated with
event A is defined as
1 if A occurs ,
Taya} oeewcs 6.)
0 if A does not occur .

As a simple example, let us determine the expected number of heads that we
obtain when flipping a fair coin. Our sample space is S = {H, T}, with Pr{H} =
Pr{T} = 1/2. We can then define an indicator random variable X 7, associated
with the coin coming up heads, which is the event H. This variable counts the
number of heads obtained in this flip, and it is 1 if the coin comes up heads and 0
otherwise. We write
Xy = WH}

1 if H occurs ,

0 if T occurs .

The expected number of heads obtained in one flip of the coin is simply the ex-
pected value of our indicator variable Xz:
En] = Ell{#))
= 1-Pr{H}+0-Pr{T}
1- (1/2) + 0- (1/2)
= 1/2.

Thus the expected number of heads obtained by one flip of a fair coin is 1/2. As
the following lemma shows, the expected value of an indicator random variable
associated with an event A is equal to the probability that A occurs.

Lemma 5.1
Given a sample space S and an event A in the sample space S, let XÂ¥4 = 1 {A}.
Then E [X4] = Pr{A}.
