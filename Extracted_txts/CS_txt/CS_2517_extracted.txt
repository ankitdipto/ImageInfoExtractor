SECTION27 Memory Unie 65

Show the connections between four 4-bit binary counters with parallel load
(Fig. 2-11) to producea 16-bit binary counter with parallel load. Use a block
diagram for each 4-bit counter.

Show how the binary counter with parallel load of Fig. 2-11 can be made to
operate as a divide-by-N counter (i.e., a counter that counts from 0000 to
N-and back to 0000). Specifically show the circuit for a divide-by-10 counter
using the counter of Fig. 2-11 and an external AND gate.

The followingmemory units are spetified by thenumber of words times the
number of bits per word. How many address lines and input-output data
lines are needed in each case? (a) 2K x 16; (b) 64K x 8; (c) 16M x 32;
(d) 4G x 64.

Specify the number of bytes that can be stored in the memories listed in
Prob. 2-19. *

How many 128 x 8memory chips are needed to provide a memory capacity
of 4096 16?

Given a 32 x 8 ROM chip with an enable input, show the external connec-
tions necessary to construct a 128 X 8 ROM with four chips and a decoder.
AROM chip of 4096 x 8bits has two enable inputs and operates froma5-volt
power supply. How many pins are needed for the integrated circuit pack-

age? Draw a block diagram and label all input and output terminals in the
ROM.
