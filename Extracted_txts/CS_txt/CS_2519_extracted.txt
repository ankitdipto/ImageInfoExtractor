Thus, compared to the method used in equation (C.37), indicator random variables
greatly simplify the calculation. We shall use indicator random variables through-
out this book.

Analysis of the hiring problem using indicator random variables

Returning to the hiring problem, we now wish to compute the expected number of
times that we hire a new office assistant. In order to use a probabilistic analysis, we
assume that the candidates arrive in a random order, as discussed in the previous
section. (We shall see in Section 5.3 how to remove this assumption.) Let X be the
random variable whose value equals the number of times we hire a new office as-
sistant. We could then apply the definition of expected value from equation (C.20)
to obtain

E[X]= Sox Pr{X =x}.
x=1

but this calculation would be cumbersome. We shall instead use indicator random
variables to greatly simplify the calculation.

To use indicator random variables, instead of computing E[X] by defining one
variable associated with the number of times we hire a new office assistant, we
define n variables related to whether or not each particular candidate is hired. In
particular, we let X; be the indicator random variable associated with the event in
which the ith candidate is hired. Thus,

 

X; = I{candidate i is hired}
1. if candidate i is hired ,
0 if candidate i is not hired ,

and

X=X,4+X. +--+. (5.2)
