5.2 Indicator random variables 121

By Lemma 5.1, we have that
E[X;] = Pr {candidate i is hired} ,

and we must therefore compute the probability that lines 5-6 of HIRE-ASSISTANT
are executed.

Candidate i is hired, in line 6, exactly when candidate i is better than each of
candidates 1 through i — 1. Because we have assumed that the candidates arrive in
arandom order, the first i candidates have appeared in a random order. Any one of
these first 7 candidates is equally likely to be the best-qualified so far. Candidate i
has a probability of 1/i of being better qualified than candidates 1 through i — 1
and thus a probability of 1/i of being hired. By Lemma 5.1, we conclude that

E[X] =1/i. (5.3)

Now we can compute E [X]:

E[X]

E [= x| (by equation (5.2)) (5.4)
i=1

>» E[X;] (by linearity of expectation)
i=l

= Vivi (by equation (5.3))
i=l
= Inn+O(1) (by equation (A.7)) . (5.5)

Even though we interview 1 people, we actually hire only approximately Inn of
them, on average. We summarize this result in the following lemma.

Lemma 5.2
Assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm HIRE-
ASSISTANT has an average-case total hiring cost of O(cy Inn).

Proof The bound follows immediately from our definition of the hiring cost
and equation (5.5), which shows that the expected number of hires is approxi-
mately Inn. .

The average-case hiring cost is a significant improvement over the worst-case
hiring cost of O(cyn).
