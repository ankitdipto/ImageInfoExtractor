3-1__Data Types

Binary information in digital computers is stored in memory or processor
registers. Registers contain either dataor control information, Control informa-
tion is a bit or a group of bits used tospecify the sequence of command signals
needed for manipulation of the data in other registers. Data are numbers and
other binary-coded information that are operated on to achieve required com
putational results. In this chapter we present the most common types of data
found in digital computers and show how the various data types are repre-
sented in binary-coded form in computer registers.

‘The data types found in the registers of digital computers may be dass
fied as being one of the following categories; (1) numbers used in arithmetic
computations, (2)letters of the alphabet used indata processing, and (3) other
discrete symbols used for specific purposes. Alll types of data, except binary
numbers, are represented in computer registers in binary coded form. Thisis
because registers are made up of flip-flops and flip-flops are twostate devices
that can store only 1’s and 0's. The binary number systemis the most natural
system to use ina digtal computer. But sometimes itis convenient to employ
different number systerns, especially the decimal number system. since it is
used by people to perform arittunetic computations.
