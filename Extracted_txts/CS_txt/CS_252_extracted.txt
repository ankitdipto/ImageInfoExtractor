keep costs as small as possible, you would like to minimize the amount spent on
advertising. That is, you want to minimize the expression

X, +X. +53 4+ X4- (29.4)

Although negative advertising often occurs in political campaigns, there is no such
thing as negative-cost advertising. Consequently, we require that
x, = 0, X2. > 0, x3 = 0, and xy > 0. (29.5)

Combining inequalities (29.1)-(29.3) and (29.5) with the objective of minimiz-
ing (29.4), we obtain what is known as a “linear program.” We format this problem
as

minimize Xo + xX. + x3 + X4 (29.6)
subject to

—2x, + 8x. + Ox3 + 10x, >= 50 (29.7)
5x, + 2x. + Ox3 + Oxg = 100 (29.8)
3x, — 5x. + 10x3 -— 2x, > 25 (29.9)

X1.X2.X3,X4 > 0. (29.10)

The solution of this linear program yields your optimal strategy.

General linear programs

In the general linear-programming problem, we wish to optimize a linear function

subject to a set of linear inequalities. Given a set of real numbers @1,d2..... dy, and
a set of variables x1,X2,..., Xn, we define a linear function f on those variables
by

n
S01. X25 Xn) = AX $ 2X2 $+ + UnXn = aj Xj -
j=l

If b is a real number and /f is a linear function, then the equation
P(%1. X20 Xn) =b

is a linear equality and the inequalities

SOX. Xn) <b

and

F(X. X2.- 20 Xn) =b
