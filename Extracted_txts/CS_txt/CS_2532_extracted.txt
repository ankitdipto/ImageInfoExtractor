and j’s birthday both fall on day r is
Pr{b; =randb; =r} = Pr{b) =r}Pr{b; =r}
1/n?.

Thus, the probability that they both fall on the same day is

Pr {hj =bj} = So Pr hi =randb; =r}

r=1
You/n)
r=1

= I/n. (5.6)

More intuitively, once }; is chosen, the probability that b; is chosen to be the same
day is 1/n. Thus, the probability that i and j have the same birthday is the same
as the probability that the birthday of one of them falls on a given day. Notice,
however, that this coincidence depends on the assumption that the birthdays are
independent.

We can analyze the probability of at least 2 out of & people having matching
birthdays by looking at the complementary event. The probability that at least two
of the birthdays match is 1 minus the probability that all the birthdays are different.
The event that k people have distinct birthdays is

where A; is the event that person i’s birthday is different from person j’s for
all j <i. Since we can write By = Ag  Bg-1, we obtain from equation (C.16)
the recurrence

Pr {Bu} = Pr {Bes} Pr {Ae | Bea} . (5.7)

where we take Pr{B,} = Pr{A,} = 1 as an initial condition. In other words,
the probability that b;,b2,..., bx are distinct birthdays is the probability that
b,,b2,...,by-1 are distinct birthdays times the probability that b, ~ 0; for
i=l, .k —1, given that b;,b2,..., by, are distinct.

If bi, bo,..., by, are distinct, the conditional probability that bh, 4 5; for
i=1,2,..., k —1is Pr{Ag | Be-1} = (n —k + 1)/n, since out of the n days,
n —(k — 1) days are not taken. We iteratively apply the recurrence (5.7) to obtain
