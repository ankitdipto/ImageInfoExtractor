when —k(k — 1)/2n < In(1/2). The probability that all k birthdays are distinct
is at most 1/2 when k(k — 1) > 2n In2 or, solving the quadratic equation, when
k > (1+ V1+4+(8In2)n)/2. For n = 365, we must have k > 23. Thus, if at
least 23 people are in a room, the probability is at least 1/2 that at least two people
have the same birthday. On Mars, a year is 669 Martian days long; it therefore
takes 31 Martians to get the same effect.

An analysis using indicator random variables

We can use indicator random variables to provide a simpler but approximate anal-
ysis of the birthday paradox. For each pair (i, j ) of the k people in the room, we
define the indicator random variable Xj;, for 1 <i < j <k, by
Xj; =  I{person i and person j have the same birthday}

1 if person i and person j have the same birthday ,

0 otherwise .

By equation (5.6), the probability that two people have matching birthdays is 1/n,
and thus by Lemma 5.1, we have

E[X;;]_ = Pr{person i and person j have the same birthday}
= I/n.

Letting X be the random variable that counts the number of pairs of individuals
having the same birthday, we have
