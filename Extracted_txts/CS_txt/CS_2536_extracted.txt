Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

How many balls fall in a given bin? The number of balls that fall in a given bin
follows the binomial distribution b(k;n, 1/b). If we toss n balls, equation (C.37)
tells us that the expected number of balls that fall in the given bin is n/b.

How many balls must we toss, on the average, until a given bin contains a ball?
The number of tosses until the given bin receives a ball follows the geometric
distribution with probability 1/b and, by equation (C.32), the expected number of
tosses until success is 1/(1/b) = b.

How many balls must we toss until every bin contains at least one ball? Let us
call a toss in which a ball falls into an empty bin a “hit.” We want to know the
expected number 11 of tosses required to get b hits.

Using the hits, we can partition the 1 tosses into stages. The / th stage consists of
the tosses after the (i — 1)st hit until the ith hit. The first stage consists of the first
toss, since we are guaranteed to have a hit when all bins are empty. For each toss
during the ith stage, i — 1 bins contain balls and b —i + 1 bins are empty. Thus,
for each toss in the ith stage, the probability of obtaining a hit is (b —i + 1)/b.

Let n; denote the number of tosses in the ith stage. Thus, the number of tosses
required to get b hits isn = y? n;. Each random variable n; has a geometric
distribution with probability of success (b —i + 1)/b and thus, by equation (C.32),
we have

 
 

 

Ell = eT

By linearity of expectation, we have

i=l
= b(inb+O(1)) (by equation (A.7)) .

 

It therefore takes approximately b In b tosses before we can expect that every bin
has a ball. This problem is also known as the coupon collector’s problem, which
says that a person trying to collect each of b different coupons expects to acquire
approximately b In b randomly obtained coupons in order to succeed.
