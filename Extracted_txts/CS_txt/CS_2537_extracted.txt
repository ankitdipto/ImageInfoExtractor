5.4.3 Streaks

Suppose you flip a fair coin n times. What is the longest streak of consecutive
heads that you expect to see? The answer is @(1g), as the following analysis
shows.

We first prove that the expected length of the longest streak of heads is O(lg).
The probability that each coin flip is a head is 1/2. Let A;, be the event that a
streak of heads of length at least k begins with the ith coin flip or, more precisely,
the event that the k consecutive coin flips i,i + 1,..., i +k —1 yield only heads,
where 1 <k <nand1 <i <n—k-+1. Since coin flips are mutually independent,
for any given event A;;, the probability that all k flips are heads is

Pr{ Aig} = 1/2". (5.8)
Fork = 2 flgn],
Pr{Aiaien} = 1/218"!

< 1/2218"

= I/n?,

and thus the probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 [lg] begins in
position i is quite small. There are at most n — 2 [lgn] + 1 positions where such
a streak can begin. The probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 [lg]
begins anywhere is therefore

= In, (5.9)

since by Boole’s inequality (C.19), the probability of a union of events is at most
the sum of the probabilities of the individual events. (Note that Boole’s inequality
holds even for events such as these that are not independent.)

We now use inequality (5.9) to bound the length of the longest streak. For
j =0,1,2,...,n,let L; be the event that the longest streak of heads has length ex-
actly j, and let L be the length of the longest streak. By the definition of expected
value, we have
