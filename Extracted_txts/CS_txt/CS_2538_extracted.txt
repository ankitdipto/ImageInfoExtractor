Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

We could try to evaluate this sum using upper bounds on each Pr {L;} similar to
those computed in inequality (5.9). Unfortunately, this method would yield weak
bounds. We can use some intuition gained by the above analysis to obtain a good
bound, however. Informally, we observe that for no individual term in the sum-
mation in equation (5.10) are both the factors j and Pr{L;} large. Why? When
j = 2/flgn], then Pr{L;} is very small, and when j < 2 [lg], then j is fairly
small. More formally, we note that the events L; for 7 = 0,1,..., 7 are disjoint,
and so the probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 [lg] begins any-
where is Yj-2nenl Pr {L;}. By inequality (5.9), we have Yj-2henl Pr{Lj} <1/n.
Also, noting that 79 Pr{L;} = 1, we have that yi Pr{Lj} < 1. Thus,
we obtain

The probability that a streak of heads exceeds r [lg] flips diminishes quickly
with r. For r > 1, the probability that a streak of at least r [lg] heads starts in
position i is

Pr{Ajptientl} = 1/27henl
< I/n’.

Thus, the probability is at most n/n” = 1/n"~! that the longest streak is at
least r [lg], or equivalently, the probability is at least | — 1/n"~! that the longest
streak has length less than r [lgn].

As an example, for 2 = 1000 coin flips, the probability of having a streak of at
least 2 [lg] = 20 heads is at most 1/n = 1/1000. The chance of having a streak
longer than 3 [lg] = 30 heads is at most 1/n? = 1/1,000,000.

We now prove a complementary lower bound: the expected length of the longest
streak of heads inn coin flips is Q(lg7). To prove this bound, we look for streaks
