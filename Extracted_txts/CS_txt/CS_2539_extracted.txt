5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator random variables 137

of length s by partitioning the n flips into approximately n/s groups of s flips
each. If we choose s = |(Ig)/2], we can show that it is likely that at least one
of these groups comes up all heads, and hence it is likely that the longest streak
has length at least s = Q(lgm). We then show that the longest streak has expected
length Q(lgn).

We partition the 7 coin flips into at least [n/ |(Ign)/2]| groups of [(lgn)/2]
consecutive flips, and we bound the probability that no group comes up all heads.
By equation (5.8), the probability that the group starting in position i comes up all
heads is

The probability that a streak of heads of length at least |(lgm)/2] does not begin
in position i is therefore at most | — 1/,/7. Since the [n/ |(Ign)/2] | groups are
formed from mutually exclusive, independent coin flips, the probability that every
one of these groups fails to be a streak of length |(Ig)/2] is at most

For this argument, we used inequality (3.12), | + x < e*, and the fact, which you
might want to verify, that (2n/1gn — 1)/,/n = lgn for sufficiently large n.
Thus, the probability that the longest streak exceeds |(Ign)/2| is

We can now calculate a lower bound on the expected length of the longest streak,
beginning with equation (5.10) and proceeding in a manner similar to our analysis
of the upper bound:
