As with the birthday paradox, we can obtain a simpler but approximate analysis
using indicator random variables. We let X;; = 1{Ajx} be the indicator random
variable associated with a streak of heads of length at least k beginning with the
ith coin flip. To count the total number of such streaks, we define

n-k+1

X= d Xie.

Taking expectations and using linearity of expectation, we have

By plugging in various values for k, we can calculate the expected number of
streaks of length k. If this number is large (much greater than 1), then we expect
many streaks of length k to occur and the probability that one occurs is high. If
