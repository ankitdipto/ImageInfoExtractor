Number Systems

‘A number system of base, or radix, ris a system that uses distinct symbols for
r digits. Numbers are represented by a string of digit symbols To determine
the quantity that the number represents, it is necessary to multiply each digit
by an integer power of r and then form the sum of all weighted digits. For
example, the decimal number system in everyday use employs the radix 10
system. The 10 symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The string of digits
724.5 is interpreted to represent the quantity

7x W?+2x 10' +4 x 10°+5x 10"

that is, 7 hundreds, plus 2 tens, plus 4 units, plus 5 tenths. Every decimal
number can be similarly interpreted to find the quantity it represents.

The binary number system uses the radix 2. The two digit symbols used
are Oand 1. Thestring of digits 101101 is interpreted torepresent the quantity

UX B+Ox B+ 1x Prix F+OxP+ 1x P= 45

To distinguish between different radix numbers, the digits will be enclosed in
parentheses and the radix of the number inserted as a subscript For example,
to show the equality between decimal and binary forty-five we will write
(201101), = (45)0

Besides the decimal and binary number systems, the octal (radix 8) and
hexadecimal (radix 16) are important in digital computer work. The eight sym-
bols of the octal system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The 16 symbols of the
hexadecimal system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The last
six symbols are, unfortunately, identical to the letters of the alphabet and can
cause confusion at times. However, this is the convention that has been
adopted. When used to represent hexadecimal digits, the symbols A, B,C, D,
E, F correspond to the decimal numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, respectively.

‘A number in radix r can be converted to the familiar decimal system by
forming the sum of the weighted digits. For example, octal 7364 is converted
to decimal as follows

(7364), = 7 x 8 +3 x 81+ 6x 8°+4x 87
=7x 644.3% 8+ 6x14 48 = (478.5)

The equivalent decimal number of hexadecimal F3 is obtained from the follow-
ing calculation:
(F3he= Fx 16 +3 = 15 x 16 +3 = (243)

Conversion from decimal to its equivalent representation in the radix r system
is carried out by separating the number into its integer and fraction parts and
