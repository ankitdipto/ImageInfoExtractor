We wish to determine, for each possible value of k, the probability that we
hire the most qualified applicant. We then choose the best possible k, and
implement the strategy with that value. For the moment, assume that k is
fixed. Let M(j) = max <j<; {score(i)} denote the maximum score among ap-
plicants 1 through j. Let S be the event that we succeed in choosing the best-
qualified applicant, and let S; be the event that we succeed when the best-qualified
applicant is the ith one interviewed. Since the various S; are disjoint, we have
that Pr {S} = )7?_, Pr{S;}. Noting that we never succeed when the best-qualified
applicant is one of the first k, we have that Pr{S;} = 0 fori? = 1,2,.... k. Thus,
we obtain

n
Pr{S}= > Pr{Si}. (5.12)

i=k+1

We now compute Pr {.S;}. In order to succeed when the best-qualified applicant
is the ith one, two things must happen. First, the best-qualified applicant must be
in position 7, an event which we denote by B;. Second, the algorithm must not
select any of the applicants in positions k + 1 through i — 1, which happens only if,
foreach j suchthatk+1 < j <i—1, we find that score(j) < bestscore in line 6.
(Because scores are unique, we can ignore the possibility of score(j) = bestscore.)
In other words, all of the values score(k + 1) through score(i — 1) must be less
than M(k); if any are greater than M(x), we instead return the index of the first
one that is greater. We use O; to denote the event that none of the applicants in
position k + 1 through i — | are chosen. Fortunately, the two events B; and O;
are independent. The event O; depends only on the relative ordering of the values
in positions 1 through i — 1, whereas B; depends only on whether the value in
position 7 is greater than the values in all other positions. The ordering of the
values in positions | through 7 — 1 does not affect whether the value in position i
is greater than all of them, and the value in position i does not affect the ordering
of the values in positions | through i — 1. Thus we can apply equation (C.15) to
obtain
