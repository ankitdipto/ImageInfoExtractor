Exercises

5.4-1

How many people must there be in a room before the probability that someone
has the same birthday as you do is at least 1/2? How many people must there be
before the probability that at least two people have a birthday on July 4 is greater
than 1/2?

5.4-2

Suppose that we toss balls into b bins until some bin contains two balls. Each toss
is independent, and each ball is equally likely to end up in any bin. What is the
expected number of ball tosses?

54-3 *
For the analysis of the birthday paradox, is it important that the birthdays be mutu-
ally independent, or is pairwise independence sufficient? Justify your answer.

54-4 x
How many people should be invited to a party in order to make it likely that there
are three people with the same birthday?

54-5 &
What is the probability that a k-string over a set of size n forms a k-permutation?
How does this question relate to the birthday paradox?

54-6 *

Suppose that 7 balls are tossed into n bins, where each toss is independent and the
ball is equally likely to end up in any bin. What is the expected number of empty
bins? What is the expected number of bins with exactly one ball?

54-7 *

Sharpen the lower bound on streak length by showing that in n flips of a fair coin,
the probability is less than 1/n that no streak longer than lg nâ€”2 1g 1g n consecutive
heads occurs.
