 

Part IV

ACTING LOGICALLY

 

 

 

In Part II, we saw that an agent cannot always select actions based solely on
the percepts that are available at the moment, or even the internal model of the
current state. We saw that problem-solving agents are able to plan ahead—to
consider the consequences of sequences ofactions—before acting. In Part III, we
saw that a knowledge-based agent can select actions based on explicit, logical
representations of the current state and the effects of actions. This allows the
agent to succeed in complex, inaccessible environments that are too difficult for
a problem-solving agent.

In Part IV, we put these two ideas together to build planning agents. At the
most abstract level, the task ofplanning is the same as problem solving. Planning
can be viewed as a type of problem solving in which the agent uses beliefs about
actions and their consequences to search for a solution over the more abstract
space of plans, rather than over the space of situations. Planning algorithms can
also be viewed as special-purpose theorem provers that reason efficiently with
axioms describing actions.

Chapter 11 introduces the basic ideas of planning, including the need to
divide complex problems into subgoals whose solutions can be combined to
provide a solution for the complete problem. Chapter 12 extends these ideas to
more expressive representations of states and actions, and discusses real-world
planning systems. Chapter 13 considers the execution of plans, particularly for
cases in which unknown contingencies must be handled.
