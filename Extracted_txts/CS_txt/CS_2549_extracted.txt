Notes for Chapter 5 145

 

Chapter notes

Bollobas [53], Hofri [174], and Spencer [321] contain a wealth of advanced prob-
abilistic techniques. The advantages of randomized algorithms are discussed and
surveyed by Karp [200] and Rabin [288]. The textbook by Motwani and Raghavan
[262] gives an extensive treatment of randomized algorithms.

Several variants of the hiring problem have been widely studied. These problems
are more commonly referred to as “secretary problems.” An example of work in
this area is the paper by Ajtai, Meggido, and Waarts [11].
