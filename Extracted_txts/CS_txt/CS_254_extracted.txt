Figure 29.2 (a) The linear program given in (29.12)-(29.15). Each constraint is represented by
a line and a direction. The intersection of the constraints, which is the feasible region, is shaded.
(b) The dotted lines show, respectively, the points for which the objective value is 0, 4, and 8. The
optimal solution to the linear program is x1 = 2 and x2 = 6 with objective value 8.

that the set of feasible solutions (shaded in the figure) forms a convex region! in
the two-dimensional space. We call this convex region the feasible region and the
function we wish to maximize the objective function. Conceptually, we could eval-
uate the objective function x; + x2 at each point in the feasible region; we call the
value of the objective function at a particular point the objective value. We could
then identify a point that has the maximum objective value as an optimal solution.
For this example (and for most linear programs), the feasible region contains an
infinite number of points, and so we need to determine an efficient way to find a
point that achieves the maximum objective value without explicitly evaluating the
objective function at every point in the feasible region.

In two dimensions, we can optimize via a graphical procedure. The set of points
for which X;+X2 = Z, for any Z, isa line with a slope of —1. If we plot x; +x2 = 0,
we obtain the line with slope —1 through the origin, as in Figure 29.2(b). The
intersection of this line and the feasible region is the set of feasible solutions that
have an objective value of 0. In this case, that intersection of the line with the
feasible region is the single point (0,0). More generally, for any z, the intersection

 

An intuitive definition of a convex region is that it fulfills the requirement that for any two points in
the region, all points on a line segment between them are also in the region.
