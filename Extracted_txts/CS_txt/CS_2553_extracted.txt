converting each part separately. The conversion of a decimal integer into a base
r representation is done by successive divisions by r and accumulation of the
remainders. The conversion of a decimal fraction to radix r representation is,
accomplished by successive multiplications by r and accumulation of the in-
teger digits so obtained. Figure 3-1 demonstrates these procedures.

The conversion of decimal 41.6875 into binary is done by first separating
the number into its integer part 41 and fraction part .6875. The integer part is
converted by dividing 41 by r = 2 to give an integer quotient of 20 and a
remainder of 1. The quotient is again divided by 2 to give a new quotient and
remainder. This process is repeated until the integer quotient becomes 0. The
coefficients of the binary number are obtained from the remainders with the
first remainder giving the low-order bit of the converted binary number.

The fraction part isconverted by multiplying it by r = 2to giveaninteger
and a fraction. The new fraction (without the integer) is multiplied again by 2
to give a new integer and a new fraction. This process is repeated until the
fraction part becomes zero or until the number of digits obtained gives the
required accuracy. The coefficients of the binary fraction are obtained from
the integer digits with the first integer computed being the digit to be placed
next to the binary point. Finally, the two parts are combined to give the total
required conversion.

Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers

The conversion from and to binary, octal, and hexadecimal representation
plays an important part in digital computers. Since 2 = 8 and 2 = 16, each
octal digit corresponds to three binary digits and each hexadecimal digit cor-
responds to four binary digits. The conversion from binary to octal is easily
accomplished by partitioning the binary number into groups of three bits each.
The corresponding octal digit is then assigned to each group of bits and the
string of digits so obtained gives the octal equivalent of the binary number.
Consider, for example, a 16-bit register. Physically, one may think of the
