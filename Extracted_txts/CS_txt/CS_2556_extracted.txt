Heapsort

In this chapter, we introduce another sorting algorithm: heapsort. Like merge sort,
but unlike insertion sort, heapsort’s running time is O(n lgn). Like insertion sort,
but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array
elements are stored outside the input array at any time. Thus, heapsort combines
the better attributes of the two sorting algorithms we have already discussed.

Heapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique: using a data struc-
ture, in this case one we call a “heap,” to manage information. Not only is the heap
data structure useful for heapsort, but it also makes an efficient priority queue. The
heap data structure will reappear in algorithms in later chapters.

The term “heap” was originally coined in the context of heapsort, but it has since
come to refer to “garbage-collected storage,” such as the programming languages
Java and Lisp provide. Our heap data structure is not garbage-collected storage,
and whenever we refer to heaps in this book, we shall mean a data structure rather
than an aspect of garbage collection.

 

6.1 Heaps

The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a
nearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1. Each
node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is com-
pletely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the
left up to a point. An array A that represents a heap is an object with two at-
tributes: A./ength, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and
A.heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within
array A. That is, although A[l..A.length] may contain numbers, only the ele-
ments in A[]..A.heap-size], where 0 < A.heap-size < A.length, are valid ele-
ments of the heap. The root of the tree is A[1], and given the index i of a node, we
can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:
