156 Chapter 6 Heapsort

The solution to this recurrence, by case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1),
is T(n) = O(lgn). Alternatively, we can characterize the running time of MAX-
HEAPIFY on a node of height / as O(h).

Exercises

6.2-1
Using Figure 6.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAPIFY (A, 3) on
the array A = (27, 17,3, 16, 13, 10, 1, 5,7, 12, 4,8, 9,0).

6.2-2

Starting with the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY, write pseudocode for the procedure
Min-HeEaPiry (A, i), which performs the corresponding manipulation on a min-
heap. How does the running time of MIN-HEAPIFY compare to that of MAX-
HEAPIFY?

6.2-3
What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i) when the element A[/] is larger
than its children?

6.2-4
What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i) for i > A.heap-size/2?

6.2-5

The code for MAX-HEAPIFY is quite efficient in terms of constant factors, except
possibly for the recursive call in line 10, which might cause some compilers to
produce inefficient code. Write an efficient MAX-HEAPIFY that uses an iterative
control construct (a loop) instead of recursion.

6.2-6

Show that the worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap of size n
is Q(lgn). (Hint: For a heap with n nodes, give node values that cause MAX-
HEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a simple path from the root
down to a leaf.)

 

6.3 Building a heap

We can use the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY in a bottom-up manner to convert an
array A[l..n], where n = A.length, into a max-heap. By Exercise 6.1-7, the
elements in the subarray A[(|/2] +1) ..n] are all leaves of the tree, and so each is
