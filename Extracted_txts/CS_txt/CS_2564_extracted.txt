6.3 Building a heap 157

a l-element heap to begin with. The procedure BUILD-MAX-HEAP goes through
the remaining nodes of the tree and runs MAX-HEAPIFY on each one.

Figure 6.3 shows an example of the action of BUILD-MAX-HEAP.
To show why BUILD-MAX-HEAP works correctly, we use the following loop
invariant:

At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2-3, each node i + 1,
i+2,..., 1 is the root of a max-heap.

We need to show that this invariant is true prior to the first loop iteration, that each
iteration of the loop maintains the invariant, and that the invariant provides a useful
property to show correctness when the loop terminates.

Initialization: Prior to the first iteration of the loop, i = |n/2]. Each node
[n/2} +1, [n/2)+2,..., n isa leaf and is thus the root of a trivial max-heap.

Maintenance: To see that each iteration maintains the loop invariant, observe that
the children of node i are numbered higher than 7. By the loop invariant, there-
fore, they are both roots of max-heaps. This is precisely the condition required
for the call MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i) to make node i a max-heap root. Moreover,
the MAX-HEAPIFY call preserves the property that nodes i + 1,i + 2,..., n
are all roots of max-heaps. Decrementing / in the for loop update reestablishes
the loop invariant for the next iteration.

Termination: At termination, i = 0. By the loop invariant, each node 1,2,..., n
is the root of a max-heap. In particular, node 1 is.

We can compute a simple upper bound on the running time of BUILD-MAx-
Heap as follows. Each call to MAX-HEAPIFY costs O(lgm) time, and BUILD-
MAX-HEAP makes O(n) such calls. Thus, the running time is O(nlgn). This
upper bound, though correct, is not asymptotically tight.

We can derive a tighter bound by observing that the time for MAX-HEAPIFY to
run at a node varies with the height of the node in the tree, and the heights of most
nodes are small. Our tighter analysis relies on the properties that an n-element heap
has height [Ig | (see Exercise 6.1-2) and at most fn/2'*"] nodes of any height /1
(see Exercise 6.3-3).

The time required by MAX-HEAPIFY when called on anode of height h is O(h),
and so we can express the total cost of BUILD-MAX-HEAP as being bounded from
above by
