Figure 6.3 The operation of BUILD-MAX-HEaP, showing the data structure before the call to
MAX-HEaPIFY in line 3 of BUILD-MAX-HEApP. (a) A 10-element input array A and the bi-
nary tree it represents. The figure shows that the loop index i refers to node 5 before the call
Max-Heaptry(A,i). (b) The data structure that results. The loop index i for the next iteration
refers to node 4. (¢)-(e) Subsequent iterations of the for loop in BUILD-MAX-HEApP. Observe that
whenever MAX-HEAPIFY is called on a node, the two subtrees of that node are both max-heaps.
(f) The max-heap after BUILD-MAX-HEapP finishes.
