register as composed of 16 binary storage cells, with each cell capable of
holding eithera 1 ora 0. Suppose that the bit configuration stored in the register
is as shown in Fig. 3-2. Since a binary number consists of a string of I’s and
O's, the 16-bit register can be used to store any binary number from 0 to 2" — 1.
For the particular example shown, the binary number stored in the register is
the equivalent of decimal 44899. Starting from the low-order bit, we partition
the register into groups of three bits each (the sixteenth bit remains in a group
by itself). Each group of three bits is assigned its octal equivalent and placed
on top of the register. The string of octal digits so obtained represents the octal
equivalent of the binary number.

Conversion from binary to hexadecimal is similar except that the bits are
divided into groups of four. The corresponding hexadecimal digit for each
group of four bits is written as shown below the register of Fig. 3-2. The string
of hexadecimal digits so obtained represents the hexadecimal equivalent of the
binary number. The corresponding octal digit for each group of three bits is
easily remembered after studying the first eight entries listed in Table 3-1. The
correspondence between a hexadecimal digit and its equivalent bit code can
be found in the first 16 entries of Table 3-2.
