6.5. Priority queues 165

 

Figure 6.5 The operation of HEAP-INCREASE-KEY. (a) The max-heap of Figure 6.4(a) with a
node whose index is i heavily shaded. (b) This node has its key increased to 15. (¢) After one
iteration of the while loop of lines 4-6, the node and its parent have exchanged keys, and the index i
moves up to the parent. (d) The max-heap after one more iteration of the while loop. At this point,
A[PARENT(i)] > A[i]. The max-heap property now holds and the procedure terminates.

6.5-2
Illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, 10) on the heap A = (15, 13,9,
5,12,8,7,4,0, 6,2, 1).

6.5-3

Write pseudocode for the procedures HEAP-MINIMUM, HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN,
HEAP-DECREASE-KEY, and MIN-HEAP-INSERT that implement a min-priority
queue with a min-heap.

6.5-4
Why do we bother setting the key of the inserted node to —oo in line 2 of MAX-
HEAP-INSERT when the next thing we do is increase its key to the desired value?
