Problems for Chapter 6 167

BuILD-MAXx-HEapP’ (A)

1 A.heap-size = 1

2 fori = 2to A.length

3 MAX-HEAaP-INSERT(A, A[i])

a. Do the procedures BUILD-MAX-HEAP and BUILD-MAX-HEaP’ always create
the same heap when run on the same input array? Prove that they do, or provide
a counterexample.

b. Show that in the worst case, BUILD-MAX-HEAP’ requires @(nlgn) time to
build an n-element heap.

6-2 Analysis of d-ary heaps
A d-ary heap is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) non-leaf
nodes have d children instead of 2 children.

a. How would you represent a d-ary heap in an array?
b. What is the height of a d-ary heap of n elements in terms of n and d?

c. Give an efficient implementation of EXTRACT-MAX in a d-ary max-heap. An-
alyze its running time in terms of d and n.

d, Give an efficient implementation of INSERT in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its
running time in terms of d and n.

e. Give an efficient implementation of INCREASE-KEY(A,i,k), which flags an
error if k < A[i], but otherwise sets A[i] = & and then updates the d-ary max-
heap structure appropriately. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.

6-3 Young tableaus

Anm xn Young tableau is an m x n matrix such that the entries of each row are
in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column are in sorted order
from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young tableau may be 00, which we
treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold r < mn
finite numbers.

a. Draw a4x4 Young tableau containing the elements {9, 16, 3,2, 4,8,5, 14, 12}.

b. Argue that anm x n Young tableau Y is empty if Y[1, 1] = oo. Argue that Y
is full (contains mn elements) if Y [m,n] < co.
