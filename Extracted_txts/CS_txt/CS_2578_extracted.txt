SECTION 3-1 Data Types 71

Table 3-1 lists a few octal numbers and their representation in registers
inbinary-coded form. The binary code is obtained by the procedure explained
above. Each octal digit is assigned a3-bit code as specified by the entries of the
first eight digits in the table. Similarly, Table 3-2 lists a few hexadecimal
numbers and their representation in registers in binary-coded form. Here the
binary code is obtained by assigning to each hexadecimal digit the 4-bit code
listed in the first 16 entries of the table.

â€˜Comparing the binary-coded octal and hexadecimal numbers with their
binary number equivalent we find that the bit combination in all three repre-
sentations is exactly the same. For example, decimal 99, when converted to
binary, becomes 1100011. The binary-coded octal equivalent of decimal 99 is
001 100 O11 and the binary-coded hexadecimal of decimal 99 is 0110 0011. If
weneglect the leading zerosin these threebinary representations, wetfind that
their bit combination is identical. This should be so because of the straightfor-
ward conversion that exists between binary numbers and octal or hexadecimal.
The point of all this is that a string of 1's and 0's stored in a register could
represent abinary number, but this same string of bits may be interpreted as
holding an octal numberin binary-coded form (if we divide the bits in groups
of three) or as holding a hexadecimal number in binary-coded form (if we
divide the bits in groups of four).
