Notes for Chapter 6 169

how to implement EXTRACT-MIN and INSERT in O(lgC) amortized time (see
Chapter 17 for more on amortized analysis) and DECREASE-KEY in O(1) time,
using a data structure called a radix heap. The O(lgC) bound can be improved
to O(,/lg C) using Fibonacci heaps (see Chapter 19) in conjunction with radix
heaps. Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Silverstein [65] further improved the bound to
O(g!" >*€C) expected time by combining the multilevel bucketing structure of
Denardo and Fox [85] with the heap of Thorup mentioned earlier. Raman [291]
further improved these results to obtain a bound of O(min(lg'/**¢ Cc, Ig hte n)),
for any fixed € > 0.
