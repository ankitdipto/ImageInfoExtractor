Figure 7.3 The two cases for one iteration of procedure PARTITION. (a) If A[j] > x, the only
action is to increment j , which maintains the loop invariant. (b) If A[j'] < x, index i is incremented,
Ali] and A[j] are swapped, and then / is incremented. Again, the loop invariant is maintained.

71-2

What value of g does PARTITION return when all elements in the array A[p..r]
have the same value? Modify PARTITION so that q = |(p+r)/2| when all
elements in the array A[p..1] have the same value.

7.1-3
Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n
is O(n).

71-4
How would you modify QUICKSORT to sort into nonincreasing order?

 

7.2. Performance of quicksort

The running time of quicksort depends on whether the partitioning is balanced or
unbalanced, which in turn depends on which elements are used for partitioning.
If the partitioning is balanced, the algorithm runs asymptotically as fast as merge
