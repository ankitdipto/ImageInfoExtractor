It remains to compute Pr {z; is compared to z;}. Our analysis assumes that the
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION procedure chooses each pivot randomly and indepen-
dently.

Let us think about when two items are not compared. Consider an input to
quicksort of the numbers | through 10 (in any order), and suppose that the first
pivot element is 7. Then the first call to PARTITION separates the numbers into two
sets: {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {8, 9, 10}. In doing so, the pivot element 7 is compared
to all other elements, but no number from the first set (e.g., 2) is or ever will be
compared to any number from the second set (e.g., 9).

In general, because we assume that element values are distinct, once a pivot x
is chosen with z; < x < zj, we know that z; and z; cannot be compared at any
subsequent time. If, on the other hand, z; is chosen as a pivot before any other item
in Z,;, then z; will be compared to each item in Z;;, except for itself. Similarly,
if z; is chosen as a pivot before any other item in Z;;, then z; will be compared to
each item in Z;;, except for itself. In our example, the values 7 and 9 are compared
because 7 is the first item from Z7,9 to be chosen as a pivot. In contrast, 2 and 9 will
never be compared because the first pivot element chosen from Z 9 is 7. Thus, Z;
and z; are compared if and only if the first element to be chosen as a pivot from Z;;
is either Z; or Z;.

We now compute the probability that this event occurs. Prior to the point at
which an element from Z;; has been chosen as a pivot, the whole set Z;; is together
in the same partition. Therefore, any element of Z;; is equally likely to be the first
one chosen as a pivot. Because the set Z;; has j—i +1 elements, and because pivots
are chosen randomly and independently, the probability that any given element is
the first one chosen as a pivot is 1/(j —i + 1). Thus, we have
