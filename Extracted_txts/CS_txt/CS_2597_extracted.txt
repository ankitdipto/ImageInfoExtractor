Chapter 7 Quicksort

The second line follows because the two events are mutually exclusive. Combining
equations (7.2) and (7.3), we get that

n-1 n 2
EM= 0 jist

i=l jit)

 

We can evaluate this sum using a change of variables (k = j — i) and the bound
on the harmonic series in equation (A.7):

E[X]

 

(7.4)
Thus we conclude that, using RANDOMIZED-PARTITION, the expected running
time of quicksort is O(n lg) when element values are distinct.

Exercises

74-1
Show that in the recurrence

T(n) = oanax (PQ) +T(n—q-—1))+ O(n),
T(n) = Q(n?).

74-2
Show that quicksort’s best-case running time is Q(n lg).

74-3
Show that the expression g? + (n — q — 1)? achieves a maximum over gq =
0.1,....2—1wheng =Oorg=n-1.

74-4
Show that RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT’s expected running time is Q(n1g 7).
