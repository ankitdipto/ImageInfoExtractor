Problems for Chapter 7 187

d.

RANDOMIZED-PARTITION’ and recurses only on partitions of elements not
known to be equal to each other.

Using QUICKsoORT’, how would you adjust the analysis in Section 7.4.2 to
avoid the assumption that all elements are distinct?

7-3 Alternative quicksort analysis

An alternative analysis of the running time of randomized quicksort focuses on
the expected running time of each individual recursive call to RANDOMIZED-
QuiIckKsorT, rather than on the number of comparisons performed.

a.

Argue that, given an array of size n, the probability that any particular element
is chosen as the pivot is 1/n. Use this to define indicator random variables
X; = I {ith smallest element is chosen as the pivot}. What is E [X;]?
Let T(n) be a random variable denoting the running time of quicksort on an
array of size n. Argue that
n
E[T(n)] = ex (Tq-1)+T—4) vow . (15)
q=1
Show that we can rewrite equation (7.5) as
2 n-l
E[T@)] == YIEIT@)] + OM). (7.6)
q=2

Show that
n-l 1 1
Yok igk <n? Ign—-=n?. (7.7)

2 8
k=2
(Hint: Split the summation into two parts, one for k = 2,3,..., [n/2] — 1 and
one fork = [n/2]..... n—1.)
Using the bound from equation (7.7), show that the recurrence in equation (7.6)

has the solution E[T(n)] = O(nlgn). (Hint: Show, by substitution, that
E[T(n)] < anlgn for sufficiently large n and for some positive constant a.)
