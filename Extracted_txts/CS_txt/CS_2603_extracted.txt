Table 3-3.

Alphanumeric Representation

Many applications of digital computers require the handling of data that
consist not only of numbers, but also of the letters of the alphabet and certain
special characters. An alphanumeric character set is a set of elements that includes
the 10 decimal digits, the 26 letters of the alphabet and a number of special
characters, suchas $, +, and =. Such a et contains between32 and 64 elements
(ifonly uppercase letters areincluded) orbetween 64and 128 (if both uppercase
and lowercase letters are included). In the first case, the binary code will require
sixits and in the second case, seven bits. The standard alphanumeric binary
code is the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange),
which uses seven bitsto code 128 characters. The binary code for the uppercase
letters, the decimal digits, and a few special characters is listed in Table 3-4.
Note that the decimal digits in ASCII can be converted to BCD by removing
the three high-order bits, 011. A complete list of ASCII characters is provided
in Table 11-1.

Binary codes play an important partin digital computer operations. The
codes must be in binary because registers can only hold binary information.
One must realize that binary codes merely change the symbols, not the mean-
ing of the discrete elements they represent. The operations specified for digital
