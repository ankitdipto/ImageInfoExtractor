190 Chapter 7 Quicksort

 

Chapter notes

The quicksort procedure was invented by Hoare [170]; Hoare’s version appears in
Problem 7-1. The PARTITION procedure given in Section 7.1 is due to N. Lomuto.
The analysis in Section 7.4 is due to Avrim Blum. Sedgewick [305] and Bent-
ley [43] provide a good reference on the details of implementation and how they
matter.

McIlroy [248] showed how to engineer a “killer adversary” that produces an
array on which virtually any implementation of quicksort takes @(n7) time. If the
implementation is randomized, the adversary produces the array after seeing the
random choices of the quicksort algorithm.
