Figure 8.1 The decision tree for insertion sort operating on three elements. An internal node an-
notated by i:j indicates a comparison between a; and aj. A leaf annotated by the permutation
(r(1), 72), .. x(n) indicates the ordering aq(1) < dz(2) < -*- < Gq(n)- The shaded path
indicates the decisions made when sorting the input sequence (a4; = 6,a2 = 8,a3 = 5); the
permutation (3, 1, 2) at the leaf indicates that the sorted ordering isa3 = 5 < a) =6 < az =8.
There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the input elements, and so the decision tree must have at
least 6 leaves.

they yield identical information about the relative order of a; and a;. We therefore
assume that all comparisons have the form a; < aj.

The decision-tree model

We can view comparison sorts abstractly in terms of decision trees. A decision
tree is a full binary tree that represents the comparisons between elements that
are performed by a particular sorting algorithm operating on an input of a given
size. Control, data movement, and all other aspects of the algorithm are ignored.
Figure 8.1 shows the decision tree corresponding to the insertion sort algorithm
from Section 2.1 operating on an input sequence of three elements.

In a decision tree, we annotate each internal node by i:j for some i and j in the
range 1 <i, 7 <n, where n is the number of elements in the input sequence. We
also annotate each leaf by a permutation (7(1), 7(2),..., (1)). (See Section C.1
for background on permutations.) The execution of the sorting algorithm corre-
sponds to tracing a simple path from the root of the decision tree down to a leaf.
Each internal node indicates a comparison a; < 4;. The left subtree then dictates
subsequent comparisons once we know that a; < aj, and the right subtree dictates
subsequent comparisons knowing that a; > 4;. When we come to a leaf, the sort-
ing algorithm has established the ordering dz(1) < Gz@) +++ S Axi). Because
any correct sorting algorithm must be able to produce each permutation of its input,
each of the n! permutations on 7 elements must appear as one of the leaves of the
decision tree for a comparison sort to be correct. Furthermore, each of these leaves
must be reachable from the root by a downward path corresponding to an actual
