Generalizing the terminology we introduced for the two-variable linear program,
we call expression (29.16) the objective function and the n + m inequalities in
lines (29.17) and (29.18) the constraints. The n constraints in line (29.18) are the
nonnegativity constraints. An arbitrary linear program need not have nonnegativ-
ity constraints, but standard form requires them. Sometimes we find it convenient
to express a linear program in a more compact form. If we create an m x n matrix
A = (aj;), an m-vector b = (bj), an n-vector c = (c;), and an n-vector x = (xj),
then we can rewrite the linear program defined in (29.16)—-(29.18) as

maximize c™x (29.19)
subject to

Ax < b (29.20)

x > 0. (29.21)

In line (29.19), cTx is the inner product of two vectors. In inequality (29.20), Ax
is a matrix-vector product, and in inequality (29.21), x > 0 means that each entry
of the vector x must be nonnegative. We see that we can specify a linear program
in standard form by a tuple (A, b,c), and we shall adopt the convention that A, b,
and c always have the dimensions given above.

We now introduce terminology to describe solutions to linear programs. We used
some of this terminology in the earlier example of a two-variable linear program.
We call a setting of the variables ¥ that satisfies all the constraints a feasible solu-
tion, whereas a setting of the variables X that fails to satisfy at least one constraint
is an infeasible solution. We say that a solution X has objective value c'X. A fea-
sible solution ¥ whose objective value is maximum over all feasible solutions is an
optimal solution, and we call its objective value cTX the optimal objective value.
If a linear program has no feasible solutions, we say that the linear program is in-
feasible; otherwise it is feasible. If a linear program has some feasible solutions
but does not have a finite optimal objective value, we say that the linear program
is unbounded. Exercise 29.1-9 asks you to show that a linear program can have a
finite optimal objective value even if the feasible region is not bounded.
