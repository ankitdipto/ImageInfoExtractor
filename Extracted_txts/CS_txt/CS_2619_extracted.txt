Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time

To analyze the cost of the calls to insertion sort, let n; be the random variable
denoting the number of elements placed in bucket B[/]. Since insertion sort runs
in quadratic time (see Section 2.2), the running time of bucket sort is

nal
Tin) = O(n) + S00).
i=0

We now analyze the average-case running time of bucket sort, by computing the
expected value of the running time, where we take the expectation over the input
distribution. Taking expectations of both sides and using linearity of expectation,
we have

nol
E[T(@)] = E [ew +0 ow]
i=0
nal
= O(n)+ > E [0@?)] (by linearity of expectation)
i=0
nol

= O(n) + >> 0 (E[n?]) (by equation (C.22)) . (8.1)

i=0
We claim that
E[n7]=2-1/n (8.2)

fori = 0,1,..., —1. It is no surprise that each bucket i has the same value of
E [n?], since each value in the input array A is equally likely to fall in any bucket.
To prove equation (8.2), we define indicator random variables

 

Xi; = 1{A[/] falls in bucket i}
fori =0,1,..., n—landj =1,2,..., n. Thus,

n
ne= YX; .
j=l

To compute E [n?], we expand the square and regroup terms:
