where the last line follows by linearity of expectation. We evaluate the two sum-
mations separately. Indicator random variable Xj; is 1 with probability 1/n and 0
otherwise, and therefore

E[Xj] = 7-7 +0 (: 7)

When k # j, the variables Xj; and X;x are independent, and hence

Substituting these two expected values in equation (8.3), we obtain
