SECTION 3.2 Complements 75

When the value of the base r is substituted in the name, the two types are
referred to as the 2’s and I’s complement for binary numbers and the 10’s and
9s complement for decimal numbers.

(r — 1)’s Complement

Given a number N in base r having n digits, the (r ~ 1's complement of N is
defined as (r* — 1) - N. For decimal numbersr = 10 and r ~ 1 = 9, so the 9's
complement of N is (10" — 1) — N. Now, 10"representsa number that consists
of a single 1 followed by n 0's. 10" - 1 is a number represented by n 9s. For
example, with n = 4 we have 10" = 10000 and 10* ~ 1 = 9999, It follows that
the 9’s complement of a decimal number is obtained by subtracting each digit
from 9. For example, the 9's complement of 546700 is 999999 — 546700 =
453299 and the 9's complement of 12389 is 99999 - 12389 = 87610.

For binary numbers, r = 2andr - 1 = 1, sothe I’s complement of N is.
(2"- 1) -N. Again, 2" is represented by a binary number that consists of a 1
followed byn 0's. 2" — 1isa binary number represented by n 1's. Forexample,
with n = 4, we have 2' = (10000); and 2* - 1 = (1111);. Thus the 1’s comple-
ment of abinary number is obtained by subtracting each digit from 1. However,
the subtraction of a binary digit from 1 causes the bit to change from 0 to 1 or
from 1 to 0. Therefore, the 1's complement of a binary number is formed by
changing 1's into 0’s and 0's into 1's. For example, the 1's complement of
1011001 is 0100110 and the 1’s complement of 0001111 is 1110000.

The (r — 1)’s complement of octal or hexadecimal numbers are obtained
by subtracting each digit from 7 or F (decimal 15) respectively.

(e’s) Complement

The r’s complement of an n-digit number N in base r is defined as r" — N for
N # Oand0 forN = 0. Comparing with the (r - 1)’s complement, we note
that the r’s complement is obtained by adding 1 to the (r - 1)’s complement
since r" - N = {(" = 1) - N] + 1. Thus the 10s complement of the decimal
2389 is 7610 + 1 = 7611 and is obtained by adding 1 to the %s complement
value. The 2’s complement of binary 101100 is 010011 + 1 = 010100 and is
obtained by adding 1 to the Y's complement value.

Since 10" is a number represented by a 1 followed by n O's, then 10" - N,
which is the 10's complement of N, can be formed also be leaving all least
significant0’s unchanged, subtracting the first nonzero least significant digit
from 10, and then subtracting. all higher significant digits from 9. The 10's
complement of 246700 is 753300 and is obtained by leaving the two zeros
unchanged, subtracting 7 from 10, and subtracting the other three digits from
9. Similarly, the 2’s complement can be formed by leaving all least significant
O's and the first 1 unchanged, and then replacing 1's by 0's and 0's by 1’s in
all other higher significant bits. The 2's complement of 1101100 is 0010100 and
is obtained by leaving the two low-order 0's and the first] unchanged, and then
replacing 1's by 0's and 0's by I's in the other four most significant bits.
