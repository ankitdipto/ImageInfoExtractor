xy > 0.

Next, we show how to convert a linear program in which some of the variables
do not have nonnegativity constraints into one in which each variable has a non-
negativity constraint. Suppose that some variable x; does not have a nonnegativity
constraint. Then, we replace each occurrence of x; by Xx; - x7, and add the non-
negativity constraints Xx; > O and x > 0. Thus, if the objective function has a
term c;x;, we replace it by cx; — c;x/, and if constraint 7 has a term aj;x;, we
replace it by ajjx; —ajjx/. Any feasible solution X to the new linear program cor-
responds to a feasible solution ¥ to the original linear program with ¥; = ¥; — X7
and with the same objective value. Also, any feasible solution X to the original
linear program corresponds to a feasible solution ¥ to the new linear program with
X, = ¥; and X/ = 0 if X; > 0, or with &/ = x; and Y; = 0 if xX; < 0. The two
linear programs have the same objective value regardless of the sign of x;. Thus,
the two linear programs are equivalent. We apply this conversion scheme to each
variable that does not have a nonnegativity constraint to yield an equivalent linear
program in which all variables have nonnegativity constraints.

Continuing the example, we want to ensure that each variable has a correspond-
ing nonnegativity constraint. Variable x, has such a constraint, but variable x2 does
not. Therefore, we replace x2 by two variables x} and x‘, and we modify the linear
program to obtain

 

 

maximize 2x; — 3x, + 3xy
subject to
M+ xX - Mo = 7 (29.22)
xX, — 2x, + Wx < 4
X1.X5.X9 > 0.

Next, we convert equality constraints into inequality constraints. Suppose that a
linear program has an equality constraint f(x),X2,....X%,) = b. Since x = y if
and only if both x > y and x < y, we can replace this equality constraint by the
pair of inequality constraints f(X).%2.....%,) < band f(x%1,%2.....X_) = bd.
Repeating this conversion for each equality constraint yields a linear program in
which all constraints are inequalities.

Finally, we can convert the greater-than-or-equal-to constraints to less-than-or-
equal-to constraints by multiplying these constraints through by —1. That is, any
inequality of the form
