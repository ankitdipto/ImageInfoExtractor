Taking expected values, we have

> -E[T(max(k — 1,n —k))] + O(n) (by equation (9.1)) .
k=1

In order to apply equation (C.24), we rely on Xz and T(max(k — 1,n — k)) being
independent random variables. Exercise 9.2-2 asks you to justify this assertion.
Let us consider the expression max(k — 1,1 —k). We have

k-1 ifk>[n/2],

max(k Ln) =) ith < [n/2].

If n is even, each term from T([n/2]) up to T(n — 1) appears exactly twice in
the summation, and if 1 is odd, all these terms appear twice and T(|n/2|) appears
once. Thus, we have

2 nol
E[T@|<= )° E[T&]+ 0M).

n k=|n/2)
We show that E[T(n)] = O(n) by substitution. Assume that E[T(n)] < cn for
some constant c that satisfies the initial conditions of the recurrence. We assume
that T(n) = O(1) for n less than some constant; we shall pick this constant later.
We also pick a constant a such that the function described by the O(7) term above
(which describes the non-recursive component of the running time of the algo-
rithm) is bounded from above by an for all > 0. Using this inductive hypothesis,
we have
