Chapter 29 Linear Programming

n
> aj x; >= b;
j=l

is equivalent to

n
> aijgXj; <—b;.

Thus, by replacing each coefficient a;; by —a;; and each value b; by —b;, we obtain
an equivalent less-than-or-equal-to constraint.

Finishing our example, we replace the equality in constraint (29.22) by two in-
equalities, obtaining

 

maximize 2x, — 3x, + 3xz
subject to
Mo to - XY 5 7
Mo + xX -— xy = 7 (29.23)
x — 2x, + Ixy < 4
X11 XG. XY > 0.

Finally, we negate constraint (29.23). For consistency in variable names, we re-
name x} to x2 and x to x3, obtaining the standard form

maximize 2x, — 3x, + 3X3 (29.24)
subject to

X + XxX -— XxX, < 7 (29.25)

—X} — XX. + x3 < —7 (29.26)

xX; — 2x, + 2x, <5 4 (29.27)

X1,X2,X3 > 0. (29.28)

Converting linear programs into slack form

To efficiently solve a linear program with the simplex algorithm, we prefer to ex-
press it in a form in which some of the constraints are equality constraints. More
precisely, we shall convert it into a form in which the nonnegativity constraints are
the only inequality constraints, and the remaining constraints are equalities. Let
