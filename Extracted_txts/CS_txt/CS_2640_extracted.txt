subtraction

end carry

In the definitions above it was assumed that the numbers do not have a
radix point If the original number N contains a radix point, it should be
removed temporarily to form the r’s or (r ~ 1's complement. The radix point
is then restored to the complemented number in the same relative position. It
isalso worth mentioning that the complement of the complement restores the
number to its original value. The r’s complement of N is r" — N. The comple-
ment of the complement is” ~ (r" - N) = N giving back the original number.

Subtraction of Unsigned Numbers
The direct method of subtraction taught in elementary schools uses the borrow
concept. In this method we borrow a1 from a higher significant position when
the minuend digit is smaller than the corresponding subtrahend digit. This
seems to be easiest when people perform subtraction with paper and pencil.
When subtraction is implemented with digital hardware, this method is found
to be less efficient than the method that uses complements.

Thesubtraction oftwon-digit unsignednumbers M - N(N # 0) inbase
can be done as follows:

1. Add the minuend M to the r’s complement of the subtrahend N. This
performs M + (r"- N)=M-N+r°.

2. IfM = N, thesumwill produce an end carry r” which is discarded, and
what is left is the result M ~ N.

3. IfM<N, the sum does not produce an end carry and is equal to
P= (N ~ M), which is the r’s complement of (N — M). To obtain the
answerin a familiar form, take the r’s complement of the sum and place
a negative sign in front.

Consider, for example, the subtraction 72532 — 13250 = 59282. The 10’s com-
plement of 13250 is 86750. Therefore:

   

M= 72532
10's complement of N = +86750
Sum
Discard end carry 10°
Answer

Now consider an example with M </N. The subtraction 13250 — 72532
produces negative 59282. Using the procedure with complements, we have

10's complement of N
