In order to complete the proof, we need to show that for sufficiently large n, this
last expression is at most cn or, equivalently, that cn/4 — c/2—an > 0. If we
add c/2 to both sides and factor out n, we get n(c/4 — a) > c/2. As long as we
choose the constant ¢ so that c/4—a > 0, ie., c > 4a, we can divide both sides
by c/4—a, giving

c/2 2c

> = :

~¢c/4—a_ c—4a
Thus, if we assume that T(m) = O(1) forn < 2c/(c—4a), then E[T(n)] = O(n).
We conclude that we can find any order statistic, and in particular the median, in
expected linear time, assuming that the elements are distinct.
