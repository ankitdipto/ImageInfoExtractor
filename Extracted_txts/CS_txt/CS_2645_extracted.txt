9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time 223

Exercises

9.3-1

In the algorithm SELECT, the input elements are divided into groups of 5. Will
the algorithm work in linear time if they are divided into groups of 7? Argue that
SELECT does not run in linear time if groups of 3 are used.

9.3-2
Analyze SELECT to show that if > 140, then at least [n/4] elements are greater
than the median-of-medians x and at least [n/4] elements are less than x.

9.3-3
Show how quicksort can be made to run in O(n lg 7) time in the worst case, as-
suming that all elements are distinct.

93-4 *

Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparisons to find the ith smallest element
in a set of n elements. Show that it can also find the i — 1 smaller elements and
the n —i larger elements without performing any additional comparisons.

9.3-5

Suppose that you have a “black-box” worst-case linear-time median subroutine.
Give a simple, linear-time algorithm that solves the selection problem for an arbi-
trary order statistic.

9.3-6

The kth quantiles of an n-element set are the k — 1 order statistics that divide the
sorted set into k equal-sized sets (to within 1). Give an O(n lgk)-time algorithm
to list the kth quantiles of a set.

9.3-7

Describe an O(n)-time algorithm that, given a set S of n distinct numbers and
a positive integer k < n, determines the k numbers in S that are closest to the
median of S.

9.3-8

Let X[1..n] and Y[1..n] be two arrays, each containing n numbers already in
sorted order. Give an O(lg n)-time algorithm to find the median of all 2n elements
in arrays X and Y.

Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline
running east to west through an oil field of n wells. The company wants to connect
