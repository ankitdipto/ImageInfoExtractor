Figure 9.2. Professor Olay needs to determine the position of the east-west oil pipeline that mini-
mizes the total length of the north-south spurs.

a spur pipeline from each well directly to the main pipeline along a shortest route
(either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.2. Given the x- and y-coordinates of
the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal location of the main pipeline,
which would be the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs? Show how to
determine the optimal location in linear time.

 

Problems

9-1 Largest i numbers in sorted order

Given a set of nm numbers, we wish to find the 7 largest in sorted order using a
comparison-based algorithm. Find the algorithm that implements each of the fol-
lowing methods with the best asymptotic worst-case running time, and analyze the
running times of the algorithms in terms of n and i.

a. Sort the numbers, and list the 7 largest.
b. Build a max-priority queue from the numbers, and call EXTRACT-MAX i times.

c. Use an order-statistic algorithm to find the ith largest number, partition around
that number, and sort the i largest numbers.
