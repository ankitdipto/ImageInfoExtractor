226 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics

a. Describe an algorithm that uses U;() comparisons to find the ith smallest of n
elements, where

Un) = T(n) ifi>n/2,
"" ) tn/2) + U;([n/2]) + T(2i) otherwise .

(Hint: Begin with |n/2] disjoint pairwise comparisons, and recurse on the set

containing the smaller element from each pair.)

b. Show that, if i <n/2, then Uj(n) =n + O(T(2i) lg(n/i)).
c. Show that ifi is a constant less than n/2, then U;(n) = n + O(lgn).

d, Show that if i =n/k fork > 2, then U;(n) = n + O(T(2n/k) Ig k).

9-4 Alternative analysis of randomized selection

In this problem, we use indicator random variables to analyze the RANDOMIZED-
SELECT procedure in a manner akin to our analysis of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT
in Section 7.4.2.

As in the quicksort analysis, we assume that all elements are distinct, and we
rename the elements of the input array A as Z1,Z2...., Zn, Where Z; is the ith
smallest element. Thus, the call RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, 1,1, k) returns Zx.

For 1 <i <j <n, let

Xijx =1{2; is compared with z; sometime during the execution of the algorithm
to find zx} .

a. Give an exact expression for E [X jx]. (Hint: Your expression may have differ-
ent values, depending on the values of i, j, and k.)

b. Let Xx denote the total number of comparisons between elements of array A
when finding zx. Show that

em =(D Saat Set Sea)
a Gi i aS k-i+l
c. Show that E[X;] < 4n.

d. Conclude that, assuming all elements of array A are distinct, RANDOMIZED-
SELECT runs in expected time O(7).
