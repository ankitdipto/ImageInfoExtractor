Chapter notes

The worst-case linear-time median-finding algorithm was devised by Blum, Floyd,
Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan [50]. The fast randomized version is due to Hoare [169].
Floyd and Rivest [108] have developed an improved randomized version that parti-
tions around an element recursively selected from a small sample of the elements.
It is still unknown exactly how many comparisons are needed to determine the
median. Bent and John [41] gave a lower bound of 2n comparisons for median
finding, and Schénhage, Paterson, and Pippenger [302] gave an upper bound of 37.
Dor and Zwick have improved on both of these bounds. Their upper bound [93]
is slightly less than 2.95n, and their lower bound [94] is (2 + €)n, for a small
positive constant €, thereby improving slightly on related work by Dor et al. [92].
Paterson [272] describes some of these results along with other related work.
