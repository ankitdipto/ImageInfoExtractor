binary point

SECTION 33 Fixed-Point Representation 7

There is no end carry

Answer is negative 59282 = 10's complement of 40718

Since we are dealing with unsigned numbers, there is really no way to
get an unsigned result for the second example. When working with paper and
pencil, we recognize that the answer must be changed to a signed negative
number. When subtracting with complements, the negative answer is recog-
nized by the absence of the end carry and the complemented result.

Subtraction with complements is done with binary numbers in a similar
manner using the same procedure outlined above. Using the two binary
numbers X = 1010100 and Y = 1000011, we perform the subtraction X - Y
and Y ~ X using 2’s complements:

 

 

    

 

X= 1010100
2s complement of Y= +0111101

Sum = 10010001
Discard end carry 2’ = -10000000

 

Answer: X= Y = 0010001

Y= 1000011
2's complement of X = +0101100
Sum= 101111

 

There is no end carry

Answer is negative 0010001 = 2’s complement of 1101111

3-3__ Fixed-Point Representation

Positive integers, including zero, can be represented as unsigned numbers.
However, to represent negative integers, we need a notation for negative
values. In ordinary arithmetic, a negative number is indicated by a minus sign
and a positive number by a plus sign. Because of hardware limitations, com-
puters must represent everything with I’s and O's, induding the sign of a
number. As a consequence, it is customary to represent the sign with a bit
placed in the leftmost position of the number. The convention is to make the
sign bit equal to 0 for positive and to 1 for negative.

In addition to the sign, a number may have a binary (or decimal) point.
The position of the binary point is needed to represent fractions, integers, or
mixed integer-fraction numbers. The representation of the binary point in a
register is complicated by the fact that it is characterized by a position in the
register. There are two ways of specifying the position of the binary point in

a register: by giving it a fixed position or by employing a floating-point repre-
sentation. The fixed-point method assumes that the binary point is always
