Chapter 29 Linear Programming

tion. We call the resulting format slack form. If we write the linear program given
in (29.33)-(29.37) in slack form, we obtain

Z= 2x, — 3x. + 3x3 (29.38)
XM = To-— xX -— xX + XB (29.39)
Xs = —7 + X + % -— x3 (29.40)
XxX = 4 — x, + 2x2 -— 2x3. (29.41)

As with standard form, we find it convenient to have a more concise notation
for describing a slack form. As we shall see in Section 29.3, the sets of basic and
nonbasic variables will change as the simplex algorithm runs. We use N to denote
the set of indices of the nonbasic variables and B to denote the set of indices of
the basic variables. We always have that |V| = n, |B| = m, and NU B =
{1,2...., n +m}. The equations are indexed by the entries of B, and the variables
on the right-hand sides are indexed by the entries of NV. As in standard form, we use
bj, cj, and aj; to denote constant terms and coefficients. We also use v to denote
an optional constant term in the objective function. (We shall see a little later that
including the constant term in the objective function makes it easy to determine the
value of the objective function.) Thus we can concisely define a slack form by a
tuple (NV, B, A, b,c, v), denoting the slack form

in which all variables x are constrained to be nonnegative. Because we subtract
the sum )°j<y 4ijX; in (29.43), the values aj; are actually the negatives of the
coefficients as they “appear” in the slack form.

For example, in the slack form

x. x.
xy = 18 — s + >
we have B = {1,2,4}, N = {3, 5, 6},
