of the tree itself and do not modify the tree, even temporarily, during the proce-
dure.

104-6 x

The left-child, right-sibling representation of an arbitrary rooted tree uses three
pointers in each node: Jeft-child, right-sibling, and parent. From any node, its
parent can be reached and identified in constant time and all its children can be
reached and identified in time linear in the number of children. Show how to use
only two pointers and one boolean value in each node so that the parent of a node
or all of its children can be reached and identified in time linear in the number of
children.
