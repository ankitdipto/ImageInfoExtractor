Chapter 29 Linear Programming

29.1-5
Convert the following linear program into slack form:
maximize 2x, — 6x3
subject to
XM + % -— x3 <7
3X, -— XX > 8
—xX1 + 2x2 + 2x3 2 0
X1,X2,X3 > 0.

What are the basic and nonbasic variables?

29.1-6
Show that the following linear program is infeasible:
maximize 3x, — 2x2
subject to
y+ % S 2
—2x, — 2x < -10
X1,X2 > 0.

29.1-7
Show that the following linear program is unbounded:
maximize Xp — Xp
subject to
2x, + x S —l
—xX,; — 2x, < 2
X1,X2 > 0.

29.1-8

Suppose that we have a general linear program with variables and m constraints,
and suppose that we convert it into standard form. Give an upper bound on the
number of variables and constraints in the resulting linear program.

29.1-9
Give an example of a linear program for which the feasible region is not bounded,
but the optimal objective value is finite.
