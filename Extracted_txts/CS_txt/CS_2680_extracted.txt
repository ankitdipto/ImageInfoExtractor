Figure 11.4 (a) Problems are defined by partial plans containing only Start and Finish steps.
The initial state is entered as the effects of the Start step, and the goal state is the precondition of
the Finish step. Ordering constraints are shown as arrows between boxes. (b) The initial plan for
the shoes-and-socks problem.
