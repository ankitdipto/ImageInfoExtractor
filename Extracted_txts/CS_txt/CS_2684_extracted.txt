11.1 Direct-address tables

Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe U of
keys is reasonably small. Suppose that an application needs a dynamic set in which
each element has a key drawn from the universe U = {0,1,...,m — 1}, where m
is not too large. We shall assume that no two elements have the same key.

To represent the dynamic set, we use an array, or direct-address table, denoted
by T[0..m — 1], in which each position, or slot, corresponds to a key in the uni-
verse U. Figure 11.1 illustrates the approach; slot k points to an element in the set
with key k. If the set contains no element with key k, then T[k] = NIL.

The dictionary operations are trivial to implement:

DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH(T,k)
1 return T [k]

DiRECT-ADDRESS-INSERT(T, x)
1 T[x.key] = x

DrRECT-ADDRESS-DELETE(T, x)
1 T[x.key] = NIL

Each of these operations takes only O(1) time.

Figure 11.1 How to implement a dynamic set by a direct-address table 7. Each key in the universe
U = {0,1,...,9} corresponds to an index in the table. The set K = {2,3,5,8} of actual keys
determines the slots in the table that contain pointers to elements. The other slots, heavily shaded,
contain NIL.
