one of the other seven values 000 through 110, specifying a memory-reference
instruction. Control then inspects the value of the first bit of the instruction,
which is now available in flip-flop I. If Dy = 0 and I = 1, we have a memory-
reference instruction with an indirect address. It is then necessary to read the
