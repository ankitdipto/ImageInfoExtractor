Figure 11.4 The multiplication method of hashing. The w-bit representation of the key k is multi-
plied by the w-bit value s = A- 2”. The p highest-order bits of the lower w-bit half of the product
form the desired hash value h(k).

fractional part of kA. Then, we multiply this value by m and take the floor of the
result. In short, the hash function is

h(k) = |m (kA mod 1)] ,

where “k A mod 1” means the fractional part of kA, that is, kA — [kA].

An advantage of the multiplication method is that the value of m is not critical.
We typically choose it to be a power of 2 (m = 2? for some integer p), since we
can then easily implement the function on most computers as follows. Suppose
that the word size of the machine is w bits and that k fits into a single word. We
restrict A to be a fraction of the form s/2”, where s is an integer in the range
0 <s < 2”. Referring to Figure 11.4, we first multiply k by the w-bit integer
s = A-2”. The result is a 2w-bit value 7,2” +19, where 1, is the high-order word
of the product and rg is the low-order word of the product. The desired p-bit hash
value consists of the p most significant bits of ro.

Although this method works with any value of the constant A, it works better
with some values than with others. The optimal choice depends on the character-
istics of the data being hashed. Knuth [211] suggests that

Aw (V5 —1)/2 = 0.6180339887... (11.2)

is likely to work reasonably well.

As an example, suppose we have k = 123456, p = 14,m = 24 = 16384,
and w = 32. Adapting Knuth’s suggestion, we choose A to be the fraction of the
form s/2*? that is closest to (5 — 1)/2, so that A = 2654435769/2. Then
k +s = 327706022297664 = (76300 - 2**) + 17612864, and so r; = 76300
and ro = 17612864. The 14 most significant bits of ro yield the value h(k) = 67.
