ofeach kind of piece on the board. Now we can see where the particular piece values come from:
they give the best approximation to the likelihood of winning in the individual categories.

Most game-playing programs use a linear evaluation function, although recently nonlinear 4
functions have had a good deal of success. (Chapter 19 gives an example ofa neural network that
is trained to learn a nonlinear evaluation function for backgammon.) In constructing the linear
formula, one has to first pick the features, and then adjust the weights until the program plays
well. The latter task can be automated by having the program play lots of games against itself,
but at the moment, no one has a good idea of how to pick good features automatically.
