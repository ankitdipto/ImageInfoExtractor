values r and s modulo p; there are no collisions yet at the “mod p level.” Moreover,
each of the possible p(p—1) choices for the pair (a,b) witha # Oyields a different
resulting pair (r,s) with r # s, since we can solve for a and b given r and s:

a = ((r—s)(k =I) mod p)) mod p,

b = (r—ak) mod p,

where ((k —/)~! mod p) denotes the unique multiplicative inverse, modulo p,
of k —1. Since there are only p(p — 1) possible pairs (r,s) with r # s, there
is a one-to-one correspondence between pairs (a,b) with a # 0 and pairs (r,s)
with r ¢ s. Thus, for any given pair of inputs k and /, if we pick (a, b) uniformly
at random from Z>, x Zp, the resulting pair (r,s) is equally likely to be any pair of
distinct values modulo p.

Therefore, the probability that distinct keys & and / collide is equal to the prob-
ability that r = s (mod m) when r and s are randomly chosen as distinct values
modulo p. For a given value of 1, of the p — 1 possible remaining values for s, the
number of values s such thats # r and s =r (mod m) is at most

[p/m|—1 < ((p+m—1)/m)—1 (by inequality (3.6))
= (p-l\)/m.

The probability that s collides with r when reduced modulo m is at most
((p = 1)/m)/(p — 1) = 1/m.
Therefore, for any pair of distinct values k,/ € Zp,
Pr {hap(k) = hap(1)} < 1/m,
so that Jpn is indeed universal. :

Exercises

113-1

Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains
a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How
might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element
with a given key?

113-2

Suppose that we hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a
radix-128 number and then using the division method. We can easily represent
the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as
a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to
compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant
number of words of storage outside the string itself?
