Chapter 11 Hash Tables

Proof An element is inserted only if there is room in the table, and thus a < 1.
Inserting a key requires an unsuccessful search followed by placing the key into the
first empty slot found. Thus, the expected number of probes is at most 1/(1—a@). =

We have to do a little more work to compute the expected number of probes for
a successful search.

Theorem 11.8

Given an open-address hash table with load factor a < 1, the expected number of
probes in a successful search is at most

1 1

=i :
al a

 

assuming uniform hashing and assuming that each key in the table is equally likely
to be searched for.

Proof A search for a key k reproduces the same probe sequence as when the
element with key k was inserted. By Corollary 11.7, if k was the (i + I)st key
inserted into the hash table, the expected number of probes made in a search for k
is at most 1/(1 —i/m) = m/(m —i). Averaging over all n keys in the hash table
gives us the expected number of probes in a successful search:

1 1

If the hash table is half full, the expected number of probes in a successful search
is less than 1.387. If the hash table is 90 percent full, the expected number of probes
is less than 2.559.
