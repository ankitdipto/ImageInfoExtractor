Although itmay not seem like we have done much yet, this is actually quite an improvement
over what we could have done with the problem-solving approach. First, out ofall the things that
one can buy, and all the places that one can go, we were able to choose just the right Buy actions
and just the right places, without having to waste time considering the others. Then, once we
have chosen the actions, we need not decide how to order them; a partial-order planner can make
that decision later.

In Figure 11.8, we extend the plan by choosing two Go actions to get us to the hardware
store and supennarket, thus achieving the At preconditions of the Buy actions.

So far, everything has been easy. A planner could get this far without having to do any
search. Now it gets harder. The two Go actions have unachieved preconditions that interact with
each other, because the agent cannot be Af two places at the same time. Each Go action has a
precondition At(x), where x is the location that the agent was at before the Go action. Suppose
