CHAFTERTHREE Data Representation

equivalent binary representation. Also, the circuits required to perform deci-
mal arithmetic are more complex. However, there are some advantages in the
use of decimal representation because computer input and output data are
generated by people who use the decimal system. Some applications, such as
business data processing, require small amounts of arithmetic computations
compared to the amountrequired for input and output of decimal data. Forthis
reason, some computers and all electroniccalculators perform arithmeticoper-
ations directly with the decimal data (in a binary code) and thus eliminate the
need for conversion to binary and back to decimal. Some computer systems
have hardware for arithmetic calculations with both binary and decimal data.

The representation of signed decimal numbers in BCD is similar to the
representation of signed numbers in binary. We can either use the familiar
signed-magnitude system or the signed-complement system. The sign of a
decimal number is usually represented with four bits to conform with the 4-bit
code of the decimal digits. Itis customary to designate a plus with four 0's and
a minus with the BCD equivalent of 9, which is 1001.

The signed-magnitude system is difficult to use with computers. The
signed-complement system can be either the 9s or the 10's complement, but
the 10's complements the one most often used. To obtain the 10's complement
ofa BCD number, we first take the 9s complement and then add one to the
least significant digit. The 9's complement is calculated from the subtraction
of each digit from 9.

The procedures developed for the signed-2's complement system apply
also to the signed-10’s complement system for decimal numbers. Addition is
done by adding all digits, including the sign digit, and discarding the end
carry. Obviously, this assumes that all negative numbers are in 10’ comple-
ment form Consider the addition (4375) + (~240) = +135done in thesigned-
10's complement system.

 

0 375 (0000 0011 0111 0101)sco

+9760 (1001 0111 0110 0000)cp
0 135 (0000 0001 0011 0101)sco

The 9inthe leftmost position of thesecond number indicates that thenumber
is negative. 9760 is the 10’s complement of 0240. The two numbers are added
and the end carry is discarded toobtain + 135. Of course, the decimal numbers
inside the computer must be in BCD, including the sign digits. The addition
is done with BCD adders (see Fig. 10-18).

The subtraction of decimal numbers either unsigned or in the signed-10’s
complement system is the same asin the binary case. Take the 10’s complement
of the subtrahend and add it to the minuend. Many computers have special
hardware to perform arithmetic calculations directly with decimal numbers in
BCD. The user of the computer can specify by programmed instructions that
the arithmeticoperations be performed with decimal numbers directly without
having to convert them to binary.
