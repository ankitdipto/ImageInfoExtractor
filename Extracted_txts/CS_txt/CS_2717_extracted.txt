To evaluate the summation ro "J), we observe that it is just the total number
of pairs of keys in the hash table that collide. By the properties of universal hashing,
the expected value of this summation is at most

Corollary 11.11

Suppose that we store n keys in a hash table of size m = n using a hash func-
tion / randomly chosen from a universal class of hash functions, and we set the
size of each secondary hash table tom; = nz for j = 0,1,...,m—1. Then,
the expected amount of storage required for all secondary hash tables in a perfect
hashing scheme is less than 27.

Proof Since mj; = nz for 7 =0,1,..., m —1, Theorem 11.10 gives
m1 m1
j=0 j=0
< 2n, (11.7)
which completes the proof. .

Corollary 11.12

Suppose that we store keys in a hash table of size m =n using a hash function h
randomly chosen from a universal class of hash functions, and we set the size
of each secondary hash table to mj = nF for j = 0,1,..., m— 1. Then, the
probability is less than 1/2 that the total storage used for secondary hash tables
equals or exceeds 4n.
