Proof Again we apply Markov’s inequality (C.30), Pr{X >t} < E[X]/t, this
time to inequality (11.7), with ¥ = yo mj; and t = 4n:
m-1
Pr | > m= | <

= 1/2. /
From Corollary 11.12, we see that if we test a few randomly chosen hash func-
tions from the universal family, we will quickly find one that uses a reasonable
amount of storage.
Exercises
15-1 &
Suppose that we insert n keys into a hash table of size m using open addressing
and uniform hashing. Let p(n, m) be the probability that no collisions occur. Show
that p(n,m) < e-"@-Y/2™_ (Hint: See equation (3.12).) Argue that when n ex-
ceeds ,/m, the probability of avoiding collisions goes rapidly to zero.
Problems

11-1 Longest-probe bound for hashing
Suppose that we use an open-addressed hash table of size m to store n < m/2
items.

a. Assuming uniform hashing, show that fori = 1,2,..., n, the probability is at
most 2~* that the /th insertion requires strictly more than k probes.

b. Show that fori = 1,2,..., n, the probability is O(1/n7) that the th insertion
requires more than 21g probes.

Let the random variable X; denote the number of probes required by the / th inser-
tion. You have shown in part (b) that Pr {X; > 21g} = O(1/n?). Let the random
variable X = maxj<j;<, X; denote the maximum number of probes required by
any of the 7 insertions.

c. Show that Pr{X > 2lgn} = O(1/n).

d. Show that the expected length E [X] of the longest probe sequence is O(lg).
