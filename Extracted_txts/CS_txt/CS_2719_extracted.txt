11-2 Slot-size bound for chaining

Suppose that we have a hash table with 7 slots, with collisions resolved by chain-
ing, and suppose that 7 keys are inserted into the table. Each key is equally likely
to be hashed to each slot. Let M be the maximum number of keys in any slot after
all the keys have been inserted. Your mission is to prove an O(lgn/ lg lgm) upper
bound on E[M], the expected value of M.

a. Argue that the probability Q, that exactly k keys hash to a particular slot is

given by

1)‘ 1\"* (n
o(SO-Y")
n n k
b. Let Py be the probability that M = k, that is, the probability that the slot
containing the most keys contains k keys. Show that Py <n Qx.

c. Use Stirling’s approximation, equation (3.18), to show that Ox < e*/k*.

d. Show that there exists a constant c > 1 such that Og, < 1/n? for ky =
clgn/lglgn. Conclude that Py < 1/n? fork > ky = clgn/Igign.

e. Argue that

11-3 Quadratic probing

Suppose that we are given a key k to search for in a hash table with positions
O.1...., m —1, and suppose that we have a hash function /: mapping the key space
into the set {0,1,..., m— 1}. The search scheme is as follows:

1. Compute the value j = h(k), and seti = 0.

2. Probe in position j for the desired key k. If you find it, or if this position is
empty, terminate the search.

3. Seti = i +1. Ifi now equals m, the table is full, so terminate the search.
Otherwise, set 7 = (i + j) mod m, and return to step 2.

Assume that m is a power of 2.
a. Show that this scheme is an instance of the general “quadratic probing” scheme
by exhibiting the appropriate constants c; and cz for equation (11.5).

b. Prove that this algorithm examines every table position in the worst case.
