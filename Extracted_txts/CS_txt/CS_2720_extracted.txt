11-4 Hashing and authentication

Let # be a class of hash [unetions in which each hash function ) € J€ maps the
universe U of keys to {0,1,..., — 1}. We say that 3 is k-universal if, for every
fixed sequence of k distinct eye (x, x, ..., x) and for any h chosen at
random from H, the sequence (h(x), h(x),...,h(x)) is equally likely to be
any of the m* sequences of length k with elements drawn from {0,1,...,m — 1}.

a. Show that if the family J€ of hash functions is 2-universal, then it is universal.

 

 

b. Suppose that the universe U is the set of n-tuples of values drawn from
Zp = {0,1,..., p—1}, where p is prime. Consider an element x =
(Xo. Xe. ees Xn—-1) € U. For any n-tuple a = (do. a). .... an-1) € U, de-
fine the hash function h, by

nl
ha(x) = (Xe) mod p.

j=0

Let H = {hq}. Show that J is universal, but not 2-universal. (Hint: Find a key
for which all hash functions in J€ produce the same value.)

c. Suppose that we modify 4 slightly from part (b): for any a € U and for any
b € Zp, define

nl
hiy(x) = (Xow + ') mod p

j=0

and Jt’ = {h’,,}. Argue that J’ is 2-universal. (Hint: Consider fixed n-tuples
x € U and y € U, with x; 4 y; for some i. What happens to h’/,,(x)
and h’,,(y) as a; and b range over Zp?)

d. Suppose that Alice and Bob secretly agree on a hash function h from a
2-universal family J€ of hash functions. Each h € J€ maps from a universe of
keys U to Z,, where p is prime. Later, Alice sends a message m to Bob over the
Internet, where m € U. She authenticates this message to Bob by also sending
an authentication tag ¢ = h(m), and Bob checks that the pair (m, t) he receives
indeed satisfies t = h(m). Suppose that an adversary intercepts (m, f) en route
and tries to fool Bob by replacing the pair (m,t) with a different pair (m’,t’).
Argue that the probability that the adversary succeeds in fooling Bob into ac-
cepting (m’,t’) is at most 1/p, no matter how much computing power the ad-
versary has, and even if the adversary knows the family J€ of hash functions
used.
