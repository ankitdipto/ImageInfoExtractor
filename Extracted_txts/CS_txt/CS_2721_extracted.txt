Notes for Chapter 11 285

 

Chapter notes

Knuth [211] and Gonnet [145] are excellent references for the analysis of hash-
ing algorithms. Knuth credits H. P. Luhn (1953) for inventing hash tables, along
with the chaining method for resolving collisions. At about the same time, G. M.
Amdahl originated the idea of open addressing.

Carter and Wegman introduced the notion of universal classes of hash functions
in 1979 [58].

Fredman, Komlés, and Szemerédi [112] developed the perfect hashing scheme
for static sets presented in Section 11.5. An extension of their method to dynamic
sets, handling insertions and deletions in amortized expected time O(1), has been
given by Dietzfelbinger et al. [86].
