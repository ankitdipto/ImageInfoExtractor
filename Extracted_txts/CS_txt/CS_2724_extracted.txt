the planner tries to achieve the preconditions of Go(HWS)and Go(SM)by linking them to the
At(Home)condition in the initial state. This results in the plan shown in Figure 11.9.
Unfortunately, this will lead to a problem. The step Go(HWS)adds the condition An(HWS),,
but it also deletes the condition At(Home). So if the agent goes to the hardware store, it can no
longer go from home to the supermarket. (That is, unless it introduces another step to go back
home from the hardware store—but the causal link means that the start step, not some other step,
