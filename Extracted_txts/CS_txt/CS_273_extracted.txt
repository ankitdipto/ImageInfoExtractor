Figure 29.3 (a) An example of a minimum-cost-flow problem. We denote the capacities by ¢ and
the costs by a. Vertex s is the source and vertex 1 is the sink, and we wish to send 4 units of flow
from s tor. (b) A solution to the minimum-cost flow problem in which 4 units of flow are sent from s
to. For each edge, the flow and capacity are written as flow/capacity.

function of minimizing the cost:

Multicommodity flow

As a final example, we consider another flow problem. Suppose that the Lucky
Puck company from Section 26.1 decides to diversify its product line and ship
not only hockey pucks, but also hockey sticks and hockey helmets. Each piece of
equipment is manufactured in its own factory, has its own warehouse, and must
be shipped, each day, from factory to warehouse. The sticks are manufactured in
Vancouver and must be shipped to Saskatoon, and the helmets are manufactured in
Edmonton and must be shipped to Regina. The capacity of the shipping network
does not change, however, and the different items, or commodities, must share the
same network.

This example is an instance of a multicommodity-flow problem. In this problem,
we are again given a directed graph G = (V, E) in which each edge (u,v) € E
has a nonnegative capacity c(u,v) > 0. As in the maximum-flow problem, we im-
plicitly assume that c(u,v) = 0 for (w,v) ¢ E, and that the graph has no antipar-
