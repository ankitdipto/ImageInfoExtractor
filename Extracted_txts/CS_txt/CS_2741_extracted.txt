12.4 Randomly built binary search trees 301

fori =1,2,..., n. Because exactly one value of Z,,; is 1 and all others are 0, we
also have

Yn = Yo Zn (2+ max(¥i-a, Yn-i)) -

i=l

We shall show that E[Y,,] is polynomial in 7, which will ultimately imply that
E[X,] = O(lgn).

We claim that the indicator random variable Z,,; = I1{R, = i} is independent
of the values of Y;_, and Y,,_;. Having chosen R,, = i, the left subtree (whose
exponential height is Y;_;) is randomly built on the i — 1 keys whose ranks are
less than i. This subtree is just like any other randomly built binary search tree
oni — | keys. Other than the number of keys it contains, this subtree’s structure
is not affected at all by the choice of R,, = i, and hence the random variables
Y;-, and Z,,; are independent. Likewise, the right subtree, whose exponential
height is Y,,_;, is randomly built on the n —i keys whose ranks are greater than 7.
Its structure is independent of the value of R,,, and so the random variables Y,,_;
and Z,, ; are independent. Hence, we have

E [= Zys (2+ max(Yi1, 0]

Since each term E [Yo] .E[Y,]....., E[Y,—1] appears twice in the last summation,
once as E [Y;_;] and once as E[Y,,_;], we have the recurrence
