Prove equation (12.3).

12.4-2

Describe a binary search tree on n nodes such that the average depth of a node in
the tree is O(lg 1) but the height of the tree is @(lgm). Give an asymptotic upper
bound on the height of an n-node binary search tree in which the average depth of
anode is O(Ig7).

12.4-3

Show that the notion of a randomly chosen binary search tree on n keys, where
each binary search tree of n keys is equally likely to be chosen, is different from
the notion of a randomly built binary search tree given in this section. (Hint: List
the possibilities when n = 3.)

12.4-4
Show that the function f(x) = 2* is convex.

Consider RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT operating on a sequence of n distinct input
numbers. Prove that for any constant k > 0, all but O(1/n*) of the n! input
permutations yield an O(n lg n) running time.

 

Problems

12-1 Binary search trees with equal keys
Equal keys pose a problem for the implementation of binary search trees.

a. What is the asymptotic performance of TREE-INSERT when used to insert 1
items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search treeâ€™?

We propose to improve TREE-INSERT by testing before line 5 to determine whether
z.key = x.key and by testing before line 11 to determine whether z.key = y.key.
