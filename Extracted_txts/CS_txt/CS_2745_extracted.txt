Problems for Chapter 12 305

 

Figure 12.5 A radix tree storing the bit strings 1011, 10, 011, 100, and 0. We can determine each
node’s key by traversing the simple path from the root to that node. There is no need, therefore, to
store the keys in the nodes; the keys appear here for illustrative purposes only. Nodes are heavily
shaded if the keys corresponding to them are not in the tree; such nodes are present only to establish
a path to other nodes.

a. Argue that the average depth of a node in T is

1
trac. T)= {P) .
xeT

Thus, we wish to show that the expected value of P(T) is O(nlgn).

b. Let Ty and Tp denote the left and right subtrees of tree T, respectively. Argue
that if T has n nodes, then

P(T) = P(T,) + P(r) +n—-1.

c. Let P(n) denote the average total path length of a randomly built binary search
tree with n nodes. Show that

1 n-l
P(n) =—) (PH) + Pri -1)+n-1).
"io
d. Show how to rewrite P(n) as

n-l1
P(n) = “> P(k) + O(n).
k=1

e. Recalling the alternative analysis of the randomized version of quicksort given
in Problem 7-3, conclude that P(n) = O(n Ign).
