Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees

At each recursive invocation of quicksort, we choose a random pivot element to
partition the set of elements being sorted. Each node of a binary search tree parti-
tions the set of elements that fall into the subtree rooted at that node.

Jf Describe an implementation of quicksort in which the comparisons to sort a set
of elements are exactly the same as the comparisons to insert the elements into
a binary search tree. (The order in which comparisons are made may differ, but
the same comparisons must occur.)

12-4 Number of different binary trees
Let b, denote the number of different binary trees with 1 nodes. In this problem,
you will find a formula for b,, as well as an asymptotic estimate.

a. Show that bo = 1 and that, forn > 1,

n-1
by = Yo dn :
k=0

b. Referring to Problem 4-4 for the definition of a generating function, let B(x)
be the generating function

B(x) = So bax” .
n=0

Show that B(x) = xB(x)? + 1, and hence one way to express B(x) in closed
form is

1
B(x) = xl —V1=4x) .
The Taylor expansion of f(x) around the point x = a is given by
