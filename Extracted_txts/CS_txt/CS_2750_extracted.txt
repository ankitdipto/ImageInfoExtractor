Complement of a Function

The complement of a function F when expressed in a truth table is obtained
by interchanging 1’s and 0's in the values of F in the truth table. When the
function is expressed in algebraic form, the complement of the function can be
derived by means of DeMorgan’s theorem. The general form of DeMorgan’s
theorem can be expressed as follows:

(ata taytcs tay)! = xixixsext

From the general DeMorgan’s theorem we can derive a simple procedure for
obtaining the complementof an algebraicexpression. This is done by changing
all OR operations to AND operations and all AND operations to OR operations
and then complementing each individual letter variable. As an example, con-
sider the following expression and its complement:

F=AB+CD'+B'D
Fr=(A’ + BY(C + DXB + D’)
