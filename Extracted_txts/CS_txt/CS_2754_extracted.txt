13.1 Properties of red-black trees 311

including the root, must be black. Consequently, the black-height of the root must
be at least 1/2; thus,

n>2he_y,

Moving the 1 to the left-hand side and taking logarithms on both sides yields
Ig(n + 1) = h/2, orh < 21g(n + 1). .

As an immediate consequence of this lemma, we can implement the dynamic-set
operations SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR
in O(lgn) time on red-black trees, since each can run in O(/h) time on a binary
search tree of height /1 (as shown in Chapter 12) and any red-black tree on 7 nodes
is a binary search tree with height O(lgm). (Of course, references to NIL in the
algorithms of Chapter 12 would have to be replaced by T.nil.) Although the al-
gorithms TREE-INSERT and TREE-DELETE from Chapter 12 run in O(lg7) time
when given a red-black tree as input, they do not directly support the dynamic-set
operations INSERT and DELETE, since they do not guarantee that the modified bi-
nary search tree will be a red-black tree. We shall see in Sections 13.3 and 13.4,
however, how to support these two operations in O(lg/) time.

Exercises

13.1-1

In the style of Figure 13.1(a), draw the complete binary search tree of height 3 on
the keys {1,2,...,15}. Add the NIL leaves and color the nodes in three different

ways such that the black-heights of the resulting red-black trees are 2, 3, and 4.

13.1-2

Draw the red-black tree that results after TREE-INSERT is called on the tree in
Figure 13.1 with key 36. If the inserted node is colored red, is the resulting tree a
red-black tree? What if it is colored black?

13.1-3

Let us define a relaxed red-black tree as a binary search tree that satisfies red-
black properties 1, 3, 4, and 5. In other words, the root may be either red or black.
Consider a relaxed red-black tree T whose root is red. If we color the root of T
black but make no other changes to T, is the resulting tree a red-black tree?

13.1-4

Suppose that we “absorb” every red node in a red-black tree into its black parent,
so that the children of the red node become children of the black parent. (Ignore
what happens to the keys.) What are the possible degrees of a black node after all
