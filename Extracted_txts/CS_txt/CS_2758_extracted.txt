Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees

Lert-Rorate(T, x)

 

Figure 13.3 An example of how the procedure LEFT-ROTATE(T, x) modifies a binary search tree.
Inorder tree walks of the input tree and the modified tree produce the same listing of key values.

13.2-3

Let a, b, and c be arbitrary nodes in subtrees @, 6, and y, respectively, in the left
tree of Figure 13.2. How do the depths of a, b, and c change when a left rotation
is performed on node x in the figure?

13.24

Show that any arbitrary n-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other
arbitrary n-node binary search tree using O(n) rotations. (Hint: First show that at
most ” — | right rotations suffice to transform the tree into a right-going chain.)

132-5 x

We say that a binary search tree 7; can be right-converted to binary search tree T>
if it is possible to obtain T> from T, via a series of calls to RIGHT-ROTATE. Give
an example of two trees T; and T> such that 7; cannot be right-converted to T>.
Then, show that if a tree T; can be right-converted to 7», it can be right-converted
using O(n?) calls to RIGHT-ROTATE.
