Figure 13.4 The operation of RB-INSERT-FIXUP. (a) A node z after insertion. Because both z
and its parent z.p are red, a violation of property 4 occurs. Since z’s uncle y is red, case | in the
code applies. We recolor nodes and move the pointer z up the tree, resulting in the tree shown in (b).
Once again, z and its parent are both red, but z’s uncle y is black. Since z is the right child of z.p,
case 2 applies. We perform a left rotation, and the tree that results is shown in (c). Now, z is the left
child of its parent, and case 3 applies. Recoloring and right rotation yield the tree in (d), which is a
legal red-black tree.
