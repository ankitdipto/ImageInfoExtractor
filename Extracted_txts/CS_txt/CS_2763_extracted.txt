self-complementing

weighted code

excess-3 code

The BCD (binary-coded decimal) has been introduced before. It uses a
straight assignment of the binary equivalent of the digit. The six unused bit
combinations listed have no meaning when BCD is used, just as the letter H
has no meaning when decimal digit symbols are written down. For example,
saying that 1001 1110 is a decimal number in BCD is like saying that 9H is a
decimal number in the conventional symbol designation. Both cases contain
an invalid symbol and therefore designate a meaningless number.

One disadvantage of using BCD is the difficulty encountered when the
9s complement of the number is to be computed. On the other hand, the 9’s
complement is easily obtained with the 2421 and the excess-3 codes listed
in Table 3-6. These two codes have a self-complementing property which
means that the 9s complement of a decimal number, when represented in one
of these codes, is easily obtained by changing 1's to 0's and ('s to 1’s. This
property is useful when arithmetic operations are done in signed-complement
Tepresentation.

The 2421 is an example of a weighted code. In a weighted code, the bits are
multiplied by the weights indicated and the sum of the weighted bits gives the
decimal digit. For example, the bit combination 1101, when weighted by the
respective digits 2421, gives the decimal equivalent of 2 x 1+ 4x1 +2x
0+1+1=7. The BCD code can be assigned the weights 8421 and for this
reason it is sometimes called the 8421 code.

The excess-3 code is a decimal code that has been used in older comput-
ers. This is an unweighted code. Its binary code assignment is obtained from
the corresponding BCD equivalent binary number after the addition of binary
3 (0011).

From Table 3-5 we note that the Gray code is not suited for a decimal code
if we were to choose the first 10 entries in the table. This is because the
transition from 9 back to 0 involves a change of three bits (from 1101 to 0000).
Toovercome this difficulty, we choose the 10 numbers starting from the third
entry 0010 up to the twelfth entry 1010. Now the transition from 1010 to 0010
involves a change of only one bit. Since the code has been shifted up three
numbers, it is called the excess-3 Gray. This code is listed with the other
decimal codes in Table 3-6.

Other Alphanumeric Codes

The ASCII code (Table 3-4) is the standard code commonly used for the
transmission of binary information. Each character is represented by a 7-bit
code and usually an eighth bit is inserted for parity (see Sec. 3-6). The code
consists of 128 characters. Ninety-five characters represent graphic symbols that
include upper- and lowercase letters, numerals zero to nine, punctuation
marks, and special symbols. Twenty-three characters represent format effectors,
which are functional characters for controlling the layout of printing or display
devices such as carriage return, line feed, horizontal tabulation, and back
