Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees

Exercises

13.4-1
Argue that after executing RB-DELETE-FIXup, the root of the tree must be black.

13.4-2
Argue that if in RB-DELETE both x and x.p are red, then property 4 is restored by
the call to RB-DELETE-FIxuP(T, x).

13.4-3

In Exercise 13.3-2, you found the red-black tree that results from successively
inserting the keys 41,38, 31,12, 19,8 into an initially empty tree. Now show the
red-black trees that result from the successive deletion of the keys in the order
8,12, 19,31, 38, 41.

13.44
In which lines of the code for RB-DELETE-FIXUP might we examine or modify
the sentinel T. nil?

13.4-5
In each of the cases of Figure 13.7, give the count of black nodes from the root of
the subtree shown to each of the subtrees a, B,..., ¢, and verify that each count

remains the same after the transformation. When a node has a color attribute c
or c’, use the notation count(c) or count(c’) symbolically in your count.

134-6

Professors Skelton and Baron are concemed that at the start of case 1 of RB-
DELETE-FIXuP, the node x.p might not be black. If the professors are correct,
then lines 5—6 are wrong. Show that x.p must be black at the start of case 1, so that
the professors have nothing to worry about.

13.4-7

Suppose that a node x is inserted into a red-black tree with RB-INSERT and then
is immediately deleted with RB-DELETE. Is the resulting red-black tree the same
as the initial red-black tree? Justify your answer.
