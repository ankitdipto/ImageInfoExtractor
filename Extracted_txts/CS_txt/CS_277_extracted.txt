Chapter 29 Linear Programming

2 = 3x, + X2 + 2x3 (29.58)
Xy = 30 -— xX -— XxX. — 3x3 (29.59)
Xs = 24 — 2x, -— 2x. — 5x3 (29.60)
Xe = 36 — 4x, -— XxX. — 2x3. (29.61)

The system of constraints (29.59)-(29.61) has 3 equations and 6 variables. Any
setting of the variables x;, %2, and x3 defines values for x4, x5, and x6; therefore,
we have an infinite number of solutions to this system of equations. A solution is
feasible if all of x1,X2...., X@ are nonnegative, and there can be an infinite num-
ber of feasible solutions as well. The infinite number of possible solutions to a
system such as this one will be useful in later proofs. We focus on the basic solu-
tion: set all the (nonbasic) variables on the right-hand side to 0 and then compute
the values of the (basic) variables on the left-hand side. In this example, the ba-
sic solution is (%),X%2...., X5) = (0,0, 0,30, 24,36) and it has objective value
z = (3-0)+ (1-0) + (2-0) =0. Observe that this basic solution sets ¥; = bj
for each i € B. An iteration of the simplex algorithm rewrites the set of equations
and the objective function so as to put a different set of variables on the right-
hand side. Thus, a different basic solution is associated with the rewritten problem.
We emphasize that the rewrite does not in any way change the underlying linear-
programming problem; the problem at one iteration has the identical set of feasible
solutions as the problem at the previous iteration. The problem does, however,
have a different basic solution than that of the previous iteration.

If a basic solution is also feasible, we call it a basic feasible solution. As we run
the simplex algorithm, the basic solution is almost always a basic feasible solution.
We shall see in Section 29.5, however, that for the first few iterations of the simplex
algorithm, the basic solution might not be feasible.

Our goal, in each iteration, is to reformulate the linear program so that the basic
solution has a greater objective value. We select a nonbasic variable x~ whose
coefficient in the objective function is positive, and we increase the value of X¢ as
much as possible without violating any of the constraints. The variable x, becomes
basic, and some other variable x; becomes nonbasic. The values of other basic
variables and of the objective function may also change.

To continue the example, let’s think about increasing the value of x;. As we
increase x), the values of x4, x5, and X¢ all decrease. Because we have a nonnega-
tivity constraint for each variable, we cannot allow any of them to become negative.
If x; increases above 30, then x4 becomes negative, and x; and x5 become nega-
tive when x, increases above 12 and 9, respectively. The third constraint (29.61) is
the tightest constraint, and it limits how much we can increase x;. Therefore, we
switch the roles of x, and x5. We solve equation (29.61) for x; and obtain
