Notes for Chapter 13 337
For nodes x and y in treap T, where y 4 x, letk = x.key andi = y.key. We
define indicator random variables

Xjx =1{y isin the right spine of the left subtree of x} .

f. Show that Xiz = 1 if and only if y.priority > x.priority, y.key < x. key, and,
for every z such that y.key < z.key < x.key, we have y. priority < Z.priority.

g. Show that
_ . (k-i-D!
Pr{Xjn = 1p = asp!
_ 1
~ (k=i + Iki)”
h. Show that
k-l 1
E[C] = —___

= I~.

i. Use asymmetry argument to show that

EDI =!-

Jj. Conclude that the expected number of rotations performed when inserting a
node into a treap is less than 2.

 

Chapter notes

The idea of balancing a search tree is due to Adel’son-Vel’skii and Landis [2], who
introduced a class of balanced search trees called “AVL trees” in 1962, described in
Problem 13-3. Another class of search trees, called “2-3 trees,” was introduced by
J. E. Hopcroft (unpublished) in 1970. A 2-3 tree maintains balance by manipulating
the degrees of nodes in the tree. Chapter 18 covers a generalization of 2-3 trees
introduced by Bayer and McCreight [35], called “B-trees.”

Red-black trees were invented by Bayer [34] under the name “symmetric binary
B-trees.” Guibas and Sedgewick [155] studied their properties at length and in-
troduced the red/black color convention. Andersson [15] gives a simpler-to-code
