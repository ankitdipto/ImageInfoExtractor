Party generator and checker networks are logic creuits canstuxted with
exdusive-OR functions. This is because, as mentioned in Sec. 1-2, the exdlu-
sive-OR function of three or more variables is by definition an odd function.
‘An odd function is a logic function whose value is binary 1 if, and only if, an
odd numberof vatiables are equal to 1. Accocding to this definition, the P(even)
function is the exclusive-OR of x, y, and 2 because it is equal to 1 when either
‘one or all twee of the variables are equal to 1 (Table 3-7). The P(odd) function
is the complement of the P(even) function.

‘As anexample, consider a 3-bit message to be transmitesd with an odd
parity bit. At the sending end, the odd-parity bit is generated by a parity
