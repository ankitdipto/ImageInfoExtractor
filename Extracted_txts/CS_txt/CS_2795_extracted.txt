Figure 14.2 Updating subtree sizes during rotations, The link around which we rotate is incident
on the two nodes whose size attributes need to be updated. The updates are local, requiring only the
size information stored in x, y, and the roots of the subtrees shown as triangles.

attribute of each node on the path. Since this path has length O(lg 7) in an n-
node red-black tree, the additional time spent maintaining size attributes in the first
phase is O(lg). We handle the O(1) rotations in the second phase of deletion
in the same manner as for insertion. Thus, both insertion and deletion, including
maintaining the size attributes, take O(Ign) time for an n-node order-statistic tree.

Exercises

141-1
Show how OS-SELECT(T.root, 10) operates on the red-black tree T of Fig-
ure 14.1.

14.1-2
Show how OS-RANK(T, x) operates on the red-black tree T of Figure 14.1 and
the node x with x.key = 35.

141-3
Write a nonrecursive version of OS-SELECT.

14.14

Write a recursive procedure OS-KEY-RANK(T,k) that takes as input an order-
statistic tree T and a key k and returns the rank of k in the dynamic set represented
by T. Assume that the keys of T are distinct.

141-5
Given an element x in an n-node order-statistic tree and a natural number i, how
can we determine the ith successor of x in the linear order of the tree in O(lgn)
time?
