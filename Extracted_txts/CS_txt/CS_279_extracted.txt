side. We then substitute this new equation, x3 = 3/2 —3x2/8 —x5/4+X6/8, into
equations (29.64)—(29.66) and obtain the new, but equivalent, system

This system has the associated basic solution (33/4, 0, 3/2, 69/4, 0,0), with ob-
jective value 111/4. Now the only way to increase the objective value is to in-
crease X2. The three constraints give upper bounds of 132, 4, and 0, respectively.
(We get an upper bound of oo from constraint (29.71) because, as we increase x2,
the value of the basic variable x4 increases also. This constraint, therefore, places
no restriction on how much we can increase X2.) We increase x2 to 4, and it be-
comes nonbasic. Then we solve equation (29.70) for x2 and substitute in the other
equations to obtain

At this point, all coefficients in the objective function are negative. As we shall see
later in this chapter, this situation occurs only when we have rewritten the linear
program so that the basic solution is an optimal solution. Thus, for this problem,
the solution (8, 4,0, 18,0,0), with objective value 28, is optimal. We can now
return to our original linear program given in (29.53)-(29.57). The only variables
in the original linear program are x), X2, and x3, and so our solution is x; = 8,
X2 = 4, and x3 = 0, with objective value (3-8) + (1-4) + (2-0) = 28. Note
that the values of the slack variables in the final solution measure how much slack
remains in each inequality. Slack variable x4 is 18, and in inequality (29.54), the
left-hand side, with value 8 + 4+ 0 = 12, is 18 less than the right-hand side of 30.
Slack variables x5 and xX are 0 and indeed, in inequalities (29.55) and (29.56),
the left-hand and right-hand sides are equal. Observe also that even though the
coefficients in the original slack form are integral, the coefficients in the other
linear programs are not necessarily integral, and the intermediate solutions are not
