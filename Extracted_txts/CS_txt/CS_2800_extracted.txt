SECTION 36 Error Detection Codes 89

generator circuit. As shownin Fig, 33, this circuit consists of one exclusive-OR
and one exclus'tve-NOR gate. Since P(even) is the exclusive-OR of x, y, z, and
P(odd) is the complement of P(even), it is necessary to employ an exclusive-
NOR gate for the needed complementation. The message and the odd-parity
bit are transmitted to their destination where they are applied to a parity
checker. An error has occurred during transmission if the parity of the fourbits
received is even, since the binary information transmitted was originally odd.
The output of the parity checker would be1 when an erroroccurs, that is, when
the number of 1's in the four inputs is even. Since the exclusive-OR function
ofthe fourinputs is an odd function, we again need to complement the output
by using an exclusive-NOR gate...

It is worth noting that the parity generator can use the same circuit as the
parity checker if the fourth input is permanently held at a logic-0 value. The
advantage of this is that the same circuit can be used for both parity generation
and parity checking.

It is evident from the example above that even-parity generators and
checkers can be implemented with exchusive-OR functions. Odd-par'ty net-
works need an exclusive-NOR at the output to complement the function.
