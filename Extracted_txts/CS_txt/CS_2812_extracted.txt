Decode the following ASCII code:
1001010 1001111 1001000 1001110 0100000 1000100 1001111 1000101

Obtain the 9's complement of the following eight-digit decimal numbers.

12349876; 00980100; 90009951; and 00000000.

Obtain the 10’s complement of the following six-digit decimal numbers:

123900; 090657; 100000; and 000000.

Obtain the 1’s and 2's complements of the following eight-digit binary

‘numbers: 10101110; 10000001; 10000000; 00000001 ; and 00000000 .

Perform the subtraction with the following unsigned decimal numbers by

taking the 10's complement of the subtrahend

a. 5250 = 1321 b. 1753 ~ 8640

«. 20-100 4. 1200 - 250

Perform the subtraction with the following unsigned binary numbers by

taking the 2's complement of the subtrahend.

a. 11010 ~ 10000 b. 11010 - 1101

«100 = 110000 4 1010100 - 1010100

Perform the arithmetic operations (+42) + (-13) and (—42) ~ (13) in bt

nary using signed-2's complement representation for negative numbers.

Perform the arithmetic operations (+70) + (+80) and (-70) + (~80) with

binary numbers in signed-2's complement representation. Use eight bits to

accommodate each number together with its sign. Show that overflow oc-

ccurs in both cases, that the last two carries are unequal, and that there is a

sign reversal.

Performthe following arithmetic operations with the decimal numbers using

signed-10's complement representation for negative numbers.

a. (-638) + (+785)

bb. (638) — (+185)

‘A.36-bit floating-point binary number has eight bits plus sign for the expo-

nent and 26 bits plus sign for the mantissa. The mantissa is a normalized

fraction. Numbers in the mantissa and exponent are in signed-magnitude

representation. Whatare the largest and smallest positive quantities that can

be represented, excluding zero?

Represent the number (+46.5o as a floating-point binary number with

24 bits. The normalized fraction mantissa has 16 bits and the exponent has

8 bits,

‘TheGray code is sometimes called a reflected code because the bit valuesare

reflected on both sides of any 2" value. For example, as shown in Table 3-5,

the values of the three low-order bits are reflected overa line drawn between

7and 8. Using this property of the Gray code, obtair:

a. The Gray code numbers for 16 through 31 asa continuation of Table 3-5.

b. The excess-3 Gray code for decimals 10 to 19 asa continuation of the list
in Table 3-6.

Represent decimal number 8620 in (a) BCD; (b) excess-3 code; (c) 2421 code;

(d) asa binary number.
