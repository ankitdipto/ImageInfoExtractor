Figure 15.2 The 8 possible ways of cutting up a rod of length 4. Above each piece is the
value of that piece, according to the sample price chart of Figure 15.1. The optimal strategy is
part (c)—cutting the rod into two pieces of length 2—which has total value 10.

fori = 1,2,...,n —1.! We denote a decomposition into pieces using ordinary
additive notation, so that 7 = 2 + 2 + 3 indicates that a rod of length 7 is cut into
three pieces—two of length 2 and one of length 3. If an optimal solution cuts the
rod into k pieces, for some 1 < k < n, then an optimal decomposition
Nn=itite- tik

of the rod into pieces of lengths i), iz, ..., i, provides maximum corresponding
revenue

Tn = Diy + Pir +++ + Pig «

For our sample problem, we can determine the optimal revenue figures 7;, for
i =1,2,...,10, by inspection, with the corresponding optimal decompositions

 

lf we required the pieces to be cut in order of nondecreasing size, there would be fewer ways
to consider. For n = 4, we would consider only 5 such ways: parts (a), (b), (©), (e), and (h)
in Figure 15.2. The number of ways is called the partition function; it is approximately equal to
e7V2n/3 /4n./3. This quantity is less than 2”—1, but still much greater than any polynomial in 7.
‘We shall not pursue this line of inquiry further, however.
