Figure 11.15 Shakey's world.

 

 

4. Climb down from a box: Down(b).
This just undoes the effects of a Climb.

5. Tum a light switch on: TurnOn(Is).

Because Shakey is short, this can only be done when Shakey is on top of a box that is at

the light switch's location*

6. Tum a light switch off: TurnOff(!s).

This is similar to TurnOn. Note that it would not be possible to represent toggling a light
switch as a STRIPS action, because there are no conditionals in the language to say that the
light becomes on if it was off and off if it was on. (Section 124 will add conditionals to

the language.)

In situation calculus, we could write an axiom to say that every box is pushable and climbable.
Butin STRIPS, we have to include individual literals for each box in the initial state. We also have
to include the complete map of the world in the initial state, in terms of what objects are Jn which

& Shakey was never dextrous enough to climb on a box or toggle a switch, but STRIPS was capable of finding plans using

these actions.
