How we parenthesize a chain of matrices can have a dramatic impact on the cost
of evaluating the product. Consider first the cost of multiplying two matrices. The
standard algorithm is given by the following pseudocode, which generalizes the
SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY procedure from Section 4.2. The attributes rows
and columns are the numbers of rows and columns in a matrix.

MATRIX-MULTIPLY (A, B)
if A.columns # B.rows
error “incompatible dimensions”
else let C be anew A.rows x B.columns matrix
for i = 1 to A.rows
for j = 1 to B.columns

for k = 1 to A.columns
Cig = Cig + ik Dey

return C

We can multiply two matrices A and B only if they are compatible: the number of
columns of A must equal the number of rows of B. If A is a p x g matrix and B is
aq xr matrix, the resulting matrix C is a p x r matrix. The time to compute C is
dominated by the number of scalar multiplications in line 8, which is pr. In what
follows, we shall express costs in terms of the number of scalar multiplications.

To illustrate the different costs incurred by different parenthesizations of a matrix
product, consider the problem of a chain (A;, A2, A3) of three matrices. Suppose
that the dimensions of the matrices are 10 x 100, 100 x 5, and 5 x 50, respec-
tively. If we multiply according to the parenthesization ((A; A2)A3), we perform
10- 100-5 = 5000 scalar multiplications to compute the 10 x 5 matrix prod-
uct A; Ao, plus another 10-5 -50 = 2500 scalar multiplications to multiply this
matrix by A3, for a total of 7500 scalar multiplications. If instead we multiply
according to the parenthesization (A;(A2A3)), we perform 100 - 5-50 = 25,000
scalar multiplications to compute the 100 x 50 matrix product A2 A3, plus another
10- 100 - 50 = 50,000 scalar multiplications to multiply A; by this matrix, for a
total of 75,000 scalar multiplications. Thus, computing the product according to
the first parenthesization is 10 times faster.

We state the matrix-chain multiplication problem as follows: given a chain
(Aj, Ao,..., An) of n matrices, where fori = 1,2,..., n, matrix A; has dimension
