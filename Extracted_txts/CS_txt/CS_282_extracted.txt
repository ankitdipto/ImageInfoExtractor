necessarily integral. Furthermore, the final solution to a linear program need not
be integral; it is purely coincidental that this example has an integral solution.

Pivoting

We now formalize the procedure for pivoting. The procedure PIVOT takes as in-
put a slack form, given by the tuple (NV, B, A,b,c,v), the index / of the leav-
ing variable x;, and the index e of the entering variable x,. It returns the tuple
(N. B.A, be, D) describing the new slack form. (Recall again that the entries of
the mxn matrices A and Aare actually the negatives of the coefficients that appear
in the slack form.)

Pivot(N, B, A,b,c,v,1,e)

1 // Compute the coefficients of the equation for new basic variable Xe.
2 let Abe anew m x n matrix
3 be = bi/dte

4 foreach j € N —{e}

5 Gej = a1; /dte

6 Gea = 1/die

7 / Compute the coefficients of the remaining constraints.
8 foreach i € B— {I}

9 by = bi ~diebe

10 for each j € N — {e}

1 Giz = ij — ieGe;

12 Giy = jee

13. // Compute the objective function.

14 D=vtebe

15 for each j € N —{e}

16 CG = Cj) — Coe;

V7 GC) = Cee

18 // Compute new sets of basic and nonbasic variables.

19 N =N-{eyuth}

20 B= B—{hU fe}

21 return (N,B,A.5.é, 1)

Pivot works as follows. Lines 3-6 compute the coefficients in the new equation
for Xe by rewriting the equation that has x; on the left-hand side to instead have x¢
on the left-hand side. Lines 8-12 update the remaining equations by substituting
the right-hand side of this new equation for each occurrence of Xe. Lines 14-17
do the same substitution for the objective function, and lines 19 and 20 update the
