15.2. Matrix-chain multiplication 373

4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

We shall go through these steps in order, demonstrating clearly how we apply each
step to the problem.

Step 1: The structure of an optimal parenthesization

For our first step in the dynamic-programming paradigm, we find the optimal sub-
structure and then use it to construct an optimal solution to the problem from opti-
mal solutions to subproblems. In the matrix-chain multiplication problem, we can
perform this step as follows. For convenience, let us adopt the notation A;..;, where
i < j, for the matrix that results from evaluating the product Aj Aj+1--- Aj. Ob-
serve that if the problem is nontrivial, i.e., i < j, then to parenthesize the product
Aj Aj+1 +++ Aj, we must split the product between Ag and Ag+, for some integer k
in the range i < k < j. Thatis, for some value of k, we first compute the matrices
Aj_« and Ax41,; and then multiply them together to produce the final product Aj, ;.
The cost of parenthesizing this way is the cost of computing the matrix A;_x, plus
the cost of computing A;;.,;, plus the cost of multiplying them together.

The optimal substructure of this problem is as follows. Suppose that to op-
timally parenthesize A; Aj;,,---A;, we split the product between Ay and Ag 41.
Then the way we parenthesize the “prefix” subchain A; Aj+1--- Ax within this
optimal parenthesization of A; Aj +1 --- Aj; must be an optimal parenthesization of
Aj Aj41 +++ Ax. Why? If there were a less costly way to parenthesize Aj Aj+1--- Ax,
then we could substitute that parenthesization in the optimal parenthesization
of A; A; +1-+- A; to produce another way to parenthesize A; A;+, --- Aj whose cost
was lower than the optimum: a contradiction. A similar observation holds for how
we parenthesize the subchain Ax +, Ax +2-+- A; in the optimal parenthesization of
A; Aj+1 +++ Aj: it must be an optimal parenthesization of Ag+) Ax+2-++ Aj.

Now we use our optimal substructure to show that we can construct an optimal
solution to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. We have seen that
any solution to a nontrivial instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem
requires us to split the product, and that any optimal solution contains within it op-
timal solutions to subproblem instances. Thus, we can build an optimal solution to
an instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem by splitting the problem into
two subproblems (optimally parenthesizing A; Aj+41--- Ag and Ax +1Ax42°+- Aj),
finding optimal solutions to subproblem instances, and then combining these op-
timal subproblem solutions. We must ensure that when we search for the correct
place to split the product, we have considered all possible places, so that we are
sure of having examined the optimal one.
