A digital system is an interconnection of digita) hardware modules that accoar
plish a specific information-procensing task. Digital systems vary in size and
complexity from a few integrated circuits to a complex of interwnnected and
interacting digital computers. Digital system design invariably uses a modular
approsch. The modules are cnnstructed from such digits) components a5
registers, decoders, arithmetic elements, and control logic. The various mod-
ules are interammeceed with common data and contro! paths to farm a digita)
computer system.

Digital modules are best defined by the «egiters they cantain and the
opentions thut are pearmed on the dita sored in them The operations
executed on data storedin registers are called A atcrooper
ation is an elementary operation getfurmed on the infurmation stared in one
or more cegisters. The result of the operation may replace the erevious binary
information of  reite or muy be Wansfered to another ep ter. Ewemples
