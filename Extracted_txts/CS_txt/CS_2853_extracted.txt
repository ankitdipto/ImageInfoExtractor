Step 1: Characterizing a longest common subsequence

In a brute-force approach to solving the LCS problem, we would enumerate all
subsequences of X and check each subsequence to see whether it is also a subse-
quence of Y, keeping track of the longest subsequence we find. Each subsequence
of X corresponds to a subset of the indices {1,2,..., m} of X. Because X has 2”
subsequences, this approach requires exponential time, making it impractical for
long sequences.

The LCS problem has an optimal-substructure property, however, as the follow-
ing theorem shows. As we shall see, the natural classes of subproblems corre-
spond to pairs of “prefixes” of the two input sequences. To be precise, given a
sequence XY = (X1,X2,....X;m), We define the ith prefix of X, fori = 0.1..... m,
as Xj; = (X1,X2..... x;). For example, if ¥ = (A, B, C, B, D, A, B), then
X4 = (A, B.C, B) and Xp is the empty sequence.

Theorem 15.1 (Optimal substructure of an LCS)
Let X = (X1,%2,..., Xm) and Y = (yi, y2,..-, Yn) be sequences, and let Z =
(Z1.Za.ees Zk) be any LCS of X and Y.

1. If Xm = Yn, then Z% =X» = VY, and Zz_; isan LCS of X,,-; and Y,—1.
2. If Xm A Yn, then Z% A Xm implies that Z is an LCS of X,,—-; and Y.
3. If Xm A Yn, then Zz, A y, implies that Z is an LCS of X and Y,_).

Proof (1) If zx # Xm, then we could append x,, = y, to Z to obtain a common
subsequence of X and Y of length k + 1, contradicting the supposition that Z is
a longest common subsequence of X and Y. Thus, we must have Z% = Xm = Yn.
Now, the prefix Z;—1 is a length-(k — 1) common subsequence of X;,—1 and Y,—1.
We wish to show that it is an LCS. Suppose for the purpose of contradiction
that there exists a common subsequence W of X,,—; and Y,—1 with length greater
than k — 1. Then, appending x, = y, to W produces a common subsequence of
X and Y whose length is greater than k, which is a contradiction.

(2) If zx # Xm, then Z isa common subsequence of X;,—; and Y. If there were a
common subsequence W of X,,—1 and Y with length greater than k, then W would
also be a common subsequence of X,,, and Y, contradicting the assumption that Z
is an LCS of X and Y.

(3) The proof is symmetric to (2). .

The way that Theorem 15.1 characterizes longest common subsequences tells
us that an LCS of two sequences contains within it an LCS of prefixes of the two
sequences. Thus, the LCS problem has an optimal-substructure property. A recur-
