SUSSMAN ANOMALY

c. Refinement vs. debugging.

d. Least commitment vs. more commitment

e. Bound variables vs. unbound variables.

f. Total order vs. partial order.

g. Interleaved vs. noninterleaved.

h. Unambiguous preconditions vs. ambiguous preconditions
i. Systematic vs. unsystematic.

11.4 Figure 11.16 shows a blocks-world planning problem known as the Sussman anomaly.
The problem was considered anomalous because the noninterleaved planners of the early 1970s
could not solve it. Encode the problem using STRIPS operators, and use POP to solve it

115 Suppose that you are the proud owner ofa brand new time machine. That means that you
can perform actions that affect situations in the past. What changes would you have to make to
the planners in this chapter to accommodate such actions?

11.6 The POP algorithm shown in the text is a regression planner, because it adds steps
whose effects satisfy unsatisfied conditions in the plan. Progression planners add steps whose
preconditions are satisfied by conditions known to be tre in the plan. Modify POP so that it
works as a progression planner, and compare its performance to the original on several problems
of your choosing.

11.7 In this exercise, we will look at planning in Shakey’s world.

a. Describe Shakey’s six actions in situation calculus notation.

b. Translate them into the STRIPS language.
Either manually or using a partial-order planner, construct a plan for Shakey to get Box2
into Room? from the starting configuration in Figure 11.15.

d. Suppose Shakey has » boxes in a room and needs to move them all into another room.
What is the complexity of the planning process in terms of n?
