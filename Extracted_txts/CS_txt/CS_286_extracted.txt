29.3 The simplex algorithm 873

An iteration of the while loop exchanges the role of a basic and a nonbasic
variable by calling the PIvoT procedure. By Exercise 29.3-3, the slack form is
equivalent to the one from the previous iteration which, by the loop invariant,
is equivalent to the initial slack form.

We now demonstrate the second part of the loop invariant. We assume that at
the start of each iteration of the while loop, b; = 0 for each i € B, and we shall
show that these inequalities remain true after the call to PIVOT in line 12. Since
the only changes to the variables b; and the set B of basic variables occur in this
assignment, it suffices to show that line 12 maintains this part of the invariant.
We let b;, aj, and B refer to values before the call of Prvot, and b; refer to
values returned from PIvoT.

First, we observe that be > 0 because b; > 0 by the loop invariant, aje > 0 by
lines 6 and 9 of SIMPLEX, and b, = bj /dje by line 3 of Pivot.

For the remaining indices i € B — {/}, we have that

by = bi —aiebe (by line 9 of Prvor)
b; —dje(bi/die) (by line 3 of Pivot) . (29.76)

We have two cases to consider, depending on whether dje > 0 or dje < 0.
If aie > 0, then since we chose / such that

bi/die <b; /die foralli € By (29.77)
we have
6; = b;—aje(bj/aje) (by equation (29.76))
> bj —aie(b;/aze) (by inequality (29.77))
= bi-bi
0,

and thus b; > 0. Ifaje < 0, then because aje, b;, and b; are all nonnegative,
equation (29.76) implies that b; must be nonnegative, too.
We now argue that the basic solution is feasible, i-e., that all variables have non-

negative values. The nonbasic variables are set to 0 and thus are nonnegative.
Each basic variable x; is defined by the equation

x; =); - Yaix; .

The basic solution sets X; = b;. Using the second part of the loop invariant, we
conclude that each basic variable X; is nonnegative.
