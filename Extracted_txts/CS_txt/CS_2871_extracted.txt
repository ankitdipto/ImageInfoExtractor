Problems for Chapter 15 407

Asan example, one way to transform the source string algorithmto the target
string altruistic is to use the following sequence of operations, where the
underlined characters are x[i] and z[/] after the operation:

 

Operation x Zz

initial strings algorithm

copy algorithm a_

copy algorithm al_

replace by t algorithm alt_

delete algorithm alt_

copy algorithm altr_

insert u algorithm altru_

insert i algorithm altrui_
insert s algorithm altruis_
twiddle algorithm altruisti_
insert c algorithm altruistic_
kill algorithm_ altruistic_

Note that there are several other sequences of transformation operations that trans-
form algorithmto altruistic.

Each of the transformation operations has an associated cost. The cost of an
operation depends on the specific application, but we assume that each operationâ€™s
cost is a constant that is known to us. We also assume that the individual costs of
the copy and replace operations are less than the combined costs of the delete and
insert operations; otherwise, the copy and replace operations would not be used.
The cost of a given sequence of transformation operations is the sum of the costs
of the individual operations in the sequence. For the sequence above, the cost of
transforming algorithmto altruistic is

 

(3 - cost(copy)) + cost(replace) + cost(delete) + (4 - cost(insert))
+ cost(twiddle) + cost(kill) .

a. Given two sequences x[1..m] and y[1..n] and set of transformation-operation
costs, the edit distance from x to y is the cost of the least expensive operation
sequence that transforms x to y. Describe a dynamic-programming algorithm
that finds the edit distance from x[1..m] to y[l..n] and prints an optimal op-
eration sequence. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your
algorithm.

The edit-distance problem generalizes the problem of aligning two DNA sequences
(see, for example, Setubal and Meidanis [310, Section 3.2]). There are several
methods for measuring the similarity of two DNA sequences by aligning them.
One such method to align two sequences x and y consists of inserting spaces at
