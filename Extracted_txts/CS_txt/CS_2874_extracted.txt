96 curren FOUR Register Transfer and Microoperations

control function

mally, we want the transfer to occur only under a predetermined control
condition. This can be shown by means of an if-then statement.

If(P = 1) then (R2 — R1)

where P is a control signal generated in the control section. It is sometimes
convenient to separate the control variables from the register transfer operation
by specifying a control function. A control function is a Boolean variable that is
equal to 1 or 0. The control function is included in the statement as follows:

 

PB OR2© RI

The control condition is terminated with acolon. It symbolizes the requirement
that the transfer operation be executed by the hardware only if P = 1.

Every statement written ina register transfer notation implies a hardware
construction for implementing the transfer. Figure 4-2 shows the block dia-
gram that depicts the transfer from R1 to R2. The » outputs of register RI are
connected to the n inputs of register R2. The letter n will be used to indicate
any number of bits for the register. It will be replaced by an actual number
when the length of the register is known. Register R2 has a load input that is
activated by the control variable P. It is assumed that the control variable is
synchronized with the same clock as the one applied to the register. As shown
