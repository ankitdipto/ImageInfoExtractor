11.8 POP is a nondeterministic algorithm, and has a choice about which operator to add to
the plan at each step and how to resolve each threat. Can you think of any domain-independent
heuristics for ordering these choices that are likely to improve POP's efficiency? Will they help }
in Shakeyâ€™s world? Are there any additional, domain-dependent heuristics that will improve the
efficiency still further?

11.9 In this exercise we will consider the monkey-and-bananas problem, in which there is a

monkey in aroom with some bananas hanging out of reach from the ceiling, but a box is available
that will enable the monkey to reach the bananas if he climbs on it. Initially, the monkey is at
A, the bananas at B, and the box at C. The monkey and box have height Low, but ifthe monkey
climbs onto the box he will have height High, the same as the bananas. The actions available
to the monkey include Go from one place to another, Push an object from one place to another,
Climb onto an object, and Grasp an object. Grasping results in holding the object if the monkey
and object are in the same place at the same height.

a. Write down the initial state description in predicate calculus. ;
b. Write down STRIPS-style definitions of the four actions, providing at least the obvious
preconditions. 3
c. Suppose the monkey wants to fool the scientists, who are offto tea, by grabbing the bananas
but leaving the box in its original place. Write this as a general goal (i.e., not assuming the
box is necessarily at C) in the language of situation calculus. Can this goal be solved by a
STRIPS-style system?
d. Your axiom for pushing is probably incorrect, because ifthe object is too heavy, its position
will remain the same when the Push operator is applied. Is this an example of the frame
problem or the qualification problem?
