874 Chapter 29 Linear Programming

Termination: The while loop can terminate in one of two ways. If it terminates
because of the condition in line 3, then the current basic solution is feasible and
line 17 returns this solution. The other way it terminates is by returning “un-
bounded” in line 11. In this case, for each iteration of the for loop in lines 5-8,
when line 6 is executed, we find that aje < 0. Consider the solution X defined as

oo ifi=e,
X= 40 ifi e N—{e}.
bi —Djen Gk; fi eB.

We now show that this solution is feasible, i.e., that all variables are nonneg-
ative. The nonbasic variables other than X¥, are 0, and ¥, = oo > 0; thus all
nonbasic variables are nonnegative. For each basic variable X;, we have

% = bi —)o aii;
jen
= by ~djeXe «

The loop invariant implies that b; > 0, and we have aje < 0 and X. = co > 0.
Thus, ¥; > 0.

Now we show that the objective value for the solution ¥ is unbounded. From
equation (29.42), the objective value is

Z = v+ Vek
jEN
= VACEXe «

Since ce > 0 (by line 4 of SIMPLEX) and X = oo, the objective value is 00,
and thus the linear program is unbounded. .

It remains to show that SIMPLEX terminates, and when it does terminate, the
solution it returns is optimal. Section 29.4 will address optimality. We now discuss
termination.

Termination

In the example given in the beginning of this section, each iteration of the simplex
algorithm increased the objective value associated with the basic solution. As Ex-
ercise 29.3-2 asks you to show, no iteration of SIMPLEX can decrease the objective
value associated with the basic solution. Unfortunately, it is possible that an itera-
tion leaves the objective value unchanged. This phenomenon is called degeneracy,
and we shall now study it in greater detail.
