16.1 An activity-selection problem 421

The procedure GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR is an iterative version of the pro-
cedure RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR. It also assumes that the input activi-
ties are ordered by monotonically increasing finish time. It collects selected activ-
ities into a set A and returns this set when it is done.

2 A= {a}

k=1

5 if s[m] > fIK]

6 A= AU {am}
7 k=m

8 return A

The procedure works as follows. The variable k indexes the most recent addition
to A, corresponding to the activity ax in the recursive version. Since we consider
the activities in order of monotonically increasing finish time, f; is always the
maximum finish time of any activity in A. That is,

fie = max { fi sa; € A}. (16.3)

Lines 2-3 select activity a1, initialize A to contain just this activity, and initialize k
to index this activity. The for loop of lines 4~7 finds the earliest activity in Sx to
finish. The loop considers each activity d,, in turn and adds a,, to A if it is compat-
ible with all previously selected activities; such an activity is the earliest in Sx to
finish. To see whether activity a,, is compatible with every activity currently in A,
it suffices by equation (16.3) to check (in line 5) that its start time s,, is not earlier
than the finish time /; of the activity most recently added to A. If activity a, is
compatible, then lines 6-7 add activity a, to A and set k to m. The set A returned
by the call GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f) is precisely the set returned by
the call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (5, f,0,1).

Like the recursive version, GREEDY-ACTIVIT Y-SELECTOR schedules a set of 1
activities in ©(m) time, assuming that the activities were already sorted initially by
their finish times.

 

Exercises

16.1-1

Give a dynamic-programming algorithm for the activity-selection problem, based
on recurrence (16.2). Have your algorithm compute the sizes c[i, j] as defined
above and also produce the maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities.
