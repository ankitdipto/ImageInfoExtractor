29.3 The simplex algorithm 875

The assignment in line 14 of Pivot, ) = v+ Cebes changes the objective value.
Since SIMPLEX calls PrvoT only when c, > 0, the only way for the objective
value to remain unchanged (i.e., ) = v) is for be to be 0. This value is assigned
as be = by/dje in line 3 of PIVOT. Since we always call PIVOT with aje 4 0, we
see that for be to equal 0, and hence the objective value to be unchanged, we must
have b; = 0.

Indeed, this situation can occur. Consider the linear program

l= Xp + X22 + X3
XM = 8 —~— x4 -— XX
Xs = X2 — x3.

Suppose that we choose x, as the entering variable and x4 as the leaving variable.
After pivoting, we obtain

z = 8 + X3 — X4
4 = 8 -— x — X4
Xs = XxX.  — X3

At this point, our only choice is to pivot with x3 entering and x5 leaving. Since
bs = 0, the objective value of 8 remains unchanged after pivoting:

Z = 8 + xX -— Xe - Xs
XM = 8 -— xX -— xX
83 = X2 — Xs.

The objective value has not changed, but our slack form has. Fortunately, if we
pivot again, with x2 entering and x leaving, the objective value increases (to 16),
and the simplex algorithm can continue.

Degeneracy can prevent the simplex algorithm from terminating, because it can
lead to a phenomenon known as cycling: the slack forms at two different itera-
tions of SIMPLEX are identical. Because of degeneracy, SIMPLEX could choose a
sequence of pivot operations that leave the objective value unchanged but repeat
a slack form within the sequence. Since SIMPLEX is a deterministic algorithm, if
it cycles, then it will cycle through the same series of slack forms forever, never
terminating.

Cycling is the only reason that SIMPLEX might not terminate. To show this fact,
we must first develop some additional machinery.

At each iteration, SIMPLEX maintains A, b, c, and v in addition to the sets
N and B. Although we need to explicitly maintain A, b, c, and v in order to
implement the simplex algorithm efficiently, we can get by without maintaining
them. In other words, the sets of basic and nonbasic variables suffice to uniquely
determine the slack form. Before proving this fact, we prove a useful algebraic
lemma.
