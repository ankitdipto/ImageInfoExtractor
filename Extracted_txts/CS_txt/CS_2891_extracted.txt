In which planning algorithms meet the real world and survive, albeit with some
significant modifications.

12.1 PRACTICAL PLANNERS

Chapter 11 showed how a partial-order planner's search through the space of plans can be more
efficient than a problem-solver's search through the space of situations. On the other hand, the
POP planner can only handle problems that are stated in the STRIPS language, and its search
process is so unguided that it can still only be used for small problems. In this chapter we
begin by surveying existing planners that operate in complex, realistic domains. This will help
to pinpoint the weaknesses of POP and suggest the necessary extensions. We then show how
the planning language and algorithms of Chapter 11 can be extended and the search focused to
handle domains like these.

Spacecraft assembly, integration, and verification

Optimum-AIV is a planner that is used by the European Space Agency to help in the assembly,
integration, and verification (AIV) of spacecraft. The system is used both to generate plans
and to monitor their execution. During monitoring, the system reminds the user of upcoming
activities, and can suggest repairs to the plan when an activity is performed late, cancelled, or
reveals something unexpected. In fact, the ability to quickly replan is the principal objective of
OptiMUM-AIV. The system does not execute the plans; that is done by humans with standard
construction and test equipment.

In complex projects like this, it is common to use scheduling tools from operations research
(OR) such as PERT charts or the critical path method. These tools essentially take a hand-
constructed complete partial-order plan and generate an optimal schedule for it. Actions are
