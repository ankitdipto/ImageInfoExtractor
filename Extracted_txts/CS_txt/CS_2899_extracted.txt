98 cuarrerrouR Register Transfer and Microoperations

determine which register is selected by the bus during each particular register
transfer.

One way ofconstructing a common bus system is with multiplexers. The
multiplexers select the source register whose binary information is then placed
on the bus. The construction of a bus system for four registers is shown in
Fig. 43. Each register has four bits, numbered 0 through 3. The bus consists
of four 4 x 1 multiplexers each having four data inputs, through 3, and two
selection inputs, 5; and Sp, In order not to complicate the diagram with 16 lines
crossing each other, we use labels to show the connections from the outputs
of the registers to the inputs of the multiplexers. For example, output 1 of
register A is connected to input 0 of MUX 1 because this input is labeled Ay.
The diagram shows that the bits in the same significant position in each register
are connected to the data inputs of one multiplexer to form one line of the bus.
Thus MUX 0 multiplexes the four Obits of the registers, MUX I multiplexes the
four 1 bits of the registers, and similarly for the other two bits.
