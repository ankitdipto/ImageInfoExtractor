Chapter 29 Linear Programming

Lemma 29.3

Let J be a set of indices. For each j € J, let aj and §; be real numbers, and let x;
be a real-valued variable. Let y be any real number. Suppose that for any settings
of the x;, we have

Yoajxy =v + Yo Bix; - (29.78)

Then a; = f; for each j € J, and y = 0.

Proof Since equation (29.78) holds for any values of the x;, we can use particular
values to draw conclusions about w, 6, and y. If we let xj = 0 for each j € J,
we conclude that y = 0. Now pick an arbitrary index j € J, and set x; = 1 and
Xx = 0 for all k # j. Then we must have a; = fj. Since we picked j as any
index in J, we conclude that w; = Bj foreach j € I. /

A particular linear program has many different slack forms; recall that each slack
form has the same set of feasible and optimal solutions as the original linear pro-
gram. We now show that the slack form of a linear program is uniquely determined
by the set of basic variables. That is, given the set of basic variables, a unique slack
form (unique set of coefficients and right-hand sides) is associated with those basic
variables.

Lemma 29.4
Let (A, b,c) be a linear program in standard form. Given a set B of basic variables,
the associated slack form is uniquely determined.

Proof Assume for the purpose of contradiction that there are two different slack
forms with the same set B of basic variables. The slack forms must also have

identical sets N = {1,2,..., n +m} — B of nonbasic variables. We write the first

slack form as

z= vt Sexy (29.79)
