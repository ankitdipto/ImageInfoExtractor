Chapter 16 Greedy Algorithms

Theorem 16.5
If G = (V, E) is an undirected graph, then Mg = (Sg, Ig) is a matroid.

Proof Clearly, Sg = E isa finite set. Furthermore, Ig is hereditary, since a
subset of a forest is a forest. Putting it another way, removing edges from an
acyclic set of edges cannot create cycles.

Thus, it remains to show that Mg satisfies the exchange property. Suppose that
G4 = (V,A) and Gg = (V, B) are forests of G and that |B| > |A]. That is, A
and B are acyclic sets of edges, and B contains more edges than A does.

We claim that a forest F = (Vr. Ef) contains exactly |Vp| — |Er| trees. To
see why, suppose that F consists of t trees, where the ith tree contains v; vertices
and e; edges. Then, we have

= |Vel—t,

which implies that f = |Vr| —|EF|. Thus, forest G4 contains |V| — | A| trees, and
forest Gg contains |V| — |B| trees.

Since forest Gg has fewer trees than forest G4 does, forest Gg must contain
some tree T whose vertices are in two different trees in forest G4. Moreover,
since T is connected, it must contain an edge (u,v) such that vertices u and v
are in different trees in forest G4. Since the edge (u,v) connects vertices in two
different trees in forest G4, we can add the edge (wu, v) to forest G4 without creating
acycle. Therefore, Mg satisfies the exchange property, completing the proof that
Mg isa matroid. .

Given a matroid M = (S, I), we call an element x ¢ A an extension of A € I
if we can add x to A while preserving independence; that is, x is an extension
of A if A U {x} € I. As an example, consider a graphic matroid Mg. If A is an
independent set of edges, then edge e is an extension of A if and only if e is not
in A and the addition of e to A does not create a cycle.

If A is an independent subset in a matroid M, we say that A is maximal if it has
no extensions. That is, A is maximal if it is not contained in any larger independent
subset of M. The following property is often useful.
