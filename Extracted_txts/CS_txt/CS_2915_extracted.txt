16.4 Matroids and greedy methods 41

We now prove that GREEDY returns an optimal subset.

Lemma 16.7 (Matroids exhibit the greedy-choice property)

Suppose that M = (S, I) is a weighted matroid with weight function w and that S
is sorted into monotonically decreasing order by weight. Let x be the first element
of S such that {x} is independent, if any such x exists. If x exists, then there exists
an optimal subset A of S that contains x.

Proof If no such x exists, then the only independent subset is the empty set and
the lemma is vacuously true. Otherwise, let B be any nonempty optimal subset.
Assume that x ¢ B; otherwise, letting A = B gives an optimal subset of S that
contains x.

No element of B has weight greater than w(x). To see why, observe that y € B
implies that {y} is independent, since B € I and I is hereditary. Our choice of x
therefore ensures that w(x) > w(y) for any y € B.

Construct the set A as follows. Begin with A = {x}. By the choice of x, set A is
independent. Using the exchange property, repeatedly find a new element of B that
we can add to A until |A| = |B], while preserving the independence of A. At that
point, A and B are the same except that A has x and B has some other element y.
That is, A = B —{y} U {x} for some y € B, and so

w(A) = w(B)—w(y) + wx)
> w(B).
Because set B is optimal, set A, which contains x, must also be optimal. :

We next show that if an element is not an option initially, then it cannot be an
option later.

Lemma 16.8
Let M = (S, I) be any matroid. If x is an element of S that is an extension of
some independent subset A of S, then x is also an extension of 9.

Proof Since x is an extension of A, we have that A U {x} is independent. Since I
is hereditary, {x} must be independent. Thus, x is an extension of 9. .

Corollary 16.9
Let M = (S, I) be any matroid. If x is an element of S such that x is not an
extension of @, then x is not an extension of any independent subset A of S.

Proof This corollary is simply the contrapositive of Lemma 16.8. .
