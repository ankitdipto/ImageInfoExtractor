Chapter 16 Greedy Algorithms

Corollary 16.9 says that any element that cannot be used immediately can never
be used. Therefore, GREEDY cannot make an error by passing over any initial
elements in S that are not an extension of @, since they can never be used.

Lemma 16.10 (Matroids exhibit the optimal-substructure property)

Let x be the first element of S chosen by GREEDY for the weighted matroid
M = (S,1). The remaining problem of finding a maximum-weight indepen-
dent subset containing x reduces to finding a maximum-weight independent subset
of the weighted matroid M’ = (S’, I’), where

So = fyeS:tyyyeT,
Do= {BCS—{x}:Bu{ryel.

and the weight function for M’ is the weight function for M, restricted to S’. (We
call M’ the contraction of M by the element x.)

Proof If Ais any maximum-weight independent subset of M containing x, then
A’ = A— {x} is an independent subset of M’. Conversely, any independent sub-
set A’ of M’ yields an independent subset A = A’ U {x} of M. Since we have in
both cases that w(A) = w(A’) + w(x), a maximum-weight solution in M contain-
ing x yields a maximum-weight solution in M’, and vice versa. .

Theorem 16.11 (Correctness of the greedy algorithm on matroids)
If M = (S, I) is a weighted matroid with weight function w, then GREEDY(M, w)
returns an optimal subset.

Proof By Corollary 16.9, any elements that GREEDY passes over initially be-
cause they are not extensions of § can be forgotten about, since they can never
be useful. Once GREEDY selects the first element x, Lemma 16.7 implies that
the algorithm does not err by adding x to A, since there exists an optimal subset
containing x. Finally, Lemma 16.10 implies that the remaining problem is one of
finding an optimal subset in the matroid M’ that is the contraction of M by x.
After the procedure GREEDY sets A to {x}, we can interpret all of its remaining
steps as acting in the matroid M’ = (S’, I’), because B is independent in M’ if
and only if B U {x} is independent in M, for all sets B € I’. Thus, the subsequent
operation of GREEDY will find a maximum-weight independent subset for M’, and
the overall operation of GREEDY will find a maximum-weight independent subset
for M. /
