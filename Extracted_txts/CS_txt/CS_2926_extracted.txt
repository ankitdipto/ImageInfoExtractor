Chapter 16 Greedy Algorithms

 

Chapter notes

Much more material on greedy algorithms and matroids can be found in Lawler
[224] and Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [271].

The greedy algorithm first appeared in the combinatorial optimization literature
in a 1971 article by Edmonds [101], though the theory of matroids dates back to
a 1935 article by Whitney [355].

Our proof of the correctness of the greedy algorithm for the activity-selection
problem is based on that of Gavril [131]. The task-scheduling problem is studied
in Lawler [224]; Horowitz, Sahni, and Rajasekaran [181]; and Brassard and Bratley
[54].

Huffman codes were invented in 1952 [185]; Lelewer and Hirschberg [231] sur-
veys data-compression techniques known as of 1987.

An extension of matroid theory to greedoid theory was pioneered by Korte and
Lovasz [216, 217, 218, 219], who greatly generalize the theory presented here.
