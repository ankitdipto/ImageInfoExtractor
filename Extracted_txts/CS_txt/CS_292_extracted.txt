Chapter 29 Linear Programming

Lemma 29.7

Assuming that INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a slack form for which the basic so-
lution is feasible, SIMPLEX either reports that a linear program is unbounded, or it
terminates with a feasible solution in at most ce") iterations.

Proof Lemmas 29.2 and 29.6 show that if INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a slack
form for which the basic solution is feasible, SIMPLEX either reports that a linear
program is unbounded, or it terminates with a feasible solution. By the contra-
positive of Lemma 29.5, if SIMPLEX terminates with a feasible solution, then it
terminates in at most ("*””) iterations. .
