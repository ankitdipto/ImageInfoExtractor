state buffers, we need n circuits with four buffers in each as shown in Fig. 4-5.
Each group of four buffers receives one significant bit from the four registers.
Each common output produces one of the lines for the common bus for a total
of n lines. Only one decoder is necessary to select between the four registers.

Memory Transfer

The operation of a memory unit was described in Sec. 2-7. The transfer of
information from a memory word to the outside environment is called a read
operation. The transfer of new information to be stored into the memory is
called a write operation. A memory word will be symbolized by the letter M.
The particular memory word among the many available is selected by the
memory address during the transfer. It is necessary to specify the address of
‘M when writing memory transfer operations. This will be done by enclosing
the address in square brackets following the letter M.

Consider a memory unit that receives the address from a register, called
the address register, symbolized by AR. The data are transferred to another
register, called the data register, symbolized by DR. The read operation can
be stated as follows:

Read: DR < MIAR]

This causes a transfer of information into DR from the memory word M
selected by the address in AR.

The write operation transfers the content of a data register to a memory
word M selected by the address. Assume that the input data are in register R1
