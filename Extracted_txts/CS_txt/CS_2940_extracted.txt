Chapter 17 Amortized Analysis

operations it has b,, 1s, where 0 < bo, b, < k. (Recall that k is the number of bits
in the counter.) We can rewrite equation (17.3) as

i=l

We have ¢; < 2 forall 1 <i <n. Since ®(Do) = bo and ®(D,,) = bn, the total
actual cost of n INCREMENT operations is

= 2n—hb,+bho.

Note in particular that since by < k, as long as k = O(n), the total actual cost

is O(n). In other words, if we execute at least = Q(k) INCREMENT operations,
the total actual cost is O(), no matter what initial value the counter contains.

Exercises

173-1

Suppose we have a potential function ® such that ®(D;) > ®(Do) for all i, but
®(Do) # 0. Show that there exists a potential function ®’ such that ®'(Do) = 0,
®'(D;) = 0 for alli > 1, and the amortized costs using ®’ are the same as the
amortized costs using ®.

Redo Exercise 17.1-3 using a potential method of analysis.

17.3-3

Consider an ordinary binary min-heap data structure with n elements supporting
the instructions INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN in O(lg) worst-case time. Give a
potential function ® such that the amortized cost of INSERT is O(lgn) and the
amortized cost of EXTRACT-MIN is O(1), and show that it works.

I73-4

What is the total cost of executing 7 of the stack operations PUSH, Pop, and
MULTIPOP, assuming that the stack begins with so objects and finishes with s,,
objects?

173-5

Suppose that a counter begins at a number with b 1s in its binary representa-
tion, rather than at 0. Show that the cost of performing n INCREMENT operations
is O(n) if n = Q(b). (Do not assume that b is constant.)
