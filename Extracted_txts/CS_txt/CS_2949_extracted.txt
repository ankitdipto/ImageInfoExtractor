Figure 17.4 The effect of a sequence of m TABLE-INSERT and TABLE-DELETE operations on the
number num; of items in the table, the number size; of slots in the table, and the potential

each measured after the ith operation. The thin line shows num;, the dashed line shows size;, and
the thick line shows ©;. Notice that immediately before an expansion, the potential has built up to
the number of items in the table, and therefore it can pay for moving all the items to the new table.
Likewise, immediately before a contraction, the potential has built up to the number of items in the
table.

tor of a nonempty table T by a(T) = T.num/T.size. Since for an empty table,
T.num = T.size = 0 and a(T) = 1, we always have T.num = a(T) - T.size,
whether the table is empty or not. We shall use as our potential function

2-T.num—T.size ifa(T) > 1/2,

7) T.size/2—T.num ifa(T) < 1/2.

Observe that the potential of an empty table is 0 and that the potential is never
negative. Thus, the total amortized cost of a sequence of operations with respect
to ® provides an upper bound on the actual cost of the sequence.

Before proceeding with a precise analysis, we pause to observe some properties
of the potential function, as illustrated in Figure 17.4. Notice that when the load
factor is 1/2, the potential is 0. When the load factor is 1, we have T. size = T.num,
which implies ®(7) = T.nwm, and thus the potential can pay for an expansion if
an item is inserted. When the load factor is 1/4, we have T. size = 4-T.num, which
