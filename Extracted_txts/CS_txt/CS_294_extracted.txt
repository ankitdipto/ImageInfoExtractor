29.3-6
Solve the following linear program using SIMPLEX:
maximize 5x; — 3X2
subject to
xX) -— x < 1
2x, + XX < 2
X1.X2 > 0.

29.3-7
Solve the following linear program using SIMPLEX:

minimize Xy + X + X3
subject to

2x, + 75x. + 3x3 = 10000
20x. + 5x2 + 10x3 > 30000
X1,X2,X3 > 0.

29.3-8
In the proof of Lemma 29.5, we argued that there are at most ci") ways to choose
a set B of basic variables. Give an example of a linear program in which there are

strictly fewer than ("i") ways to choose the set B.

 

29.4 Duality

We have proven that, under certain assumptions, SIMPLEX terminates. We have not
yet shown that it actually finds an optimal solution to a linear program, however.
In order to do so, we introduce a powerful concept called linear-programming
duality.

Duality enables us to prove that a solution is indeed optimal. We saw an exam-
ple of duality in Chapter 26 with Theorem 26.6, the max-flow min-cut theorem.
Suppose that, given an instance of a maximum-flow problem, we find a flow f
with value | f |. How do we know whether f is a maximum flow? By the max-flow
min-cut theorem, if we can find a cut whose value is also | /'|, then we have ver-
ified that f is indeed a maximum flow. This relationship provides an example of
duality: given a maximization problem, we define a related minimization problem
such that the two problems have the same optimal objective values.

Given a linear program in which the objective is to maximize, we shall describe
how to formulate a dual linear program in which the objective is to minimize and
