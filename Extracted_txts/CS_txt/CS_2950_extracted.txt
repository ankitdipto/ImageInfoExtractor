Chapter 17 Amortized Anat

 

implies ®(7) = T.num, and thus the potential can pay for a contraction if an item
is deleted.

To analyze a sequence of n TABLE-INSERT and TABLE-DELETE operations,
we let c; denote the actual cost of the ith operation, ¢; denote its amortized cost
with respect to ®, num; denote the number of items stored in the table after the ith
operation, size; denote the total size of the table after the ith operation, a; denote
the load factor of the table after the ith operation, and ®; denote the potential after
the ith operation. Initially, numo = 0, sizeo = 0, @ = 1, and By = 0.

We start with the case in which the jth operation is TABLE-INSERT. The analy-
sis is identical to that for table expansion in Section 17.4.1 if a; => 1/2. Whether
the table expands or not, the amortized cost ¢; of the operation is at most 3.
If @j-1 < 1/2, the table cannot expand as a result of the operation, since the ta-
ble expands only when q@—; = 1. If @; < 1/2 as well, then the amortized cost of
the /th operation is

G = +O -4
= 1+ (size; /2 —num;) — (size;-1/2 — num;-1)
= 1+ (size; /2 —num;) — (size;/2— (num; — 1))

= 0.
If aj, < 1/2 but a; > 1/2, then
G = G+ 0;—-O-1

= 14+ (2-num; — size;) — (size; /2 —num;-1)
= 14+ (2(numj-1 + 1) — sizej-1) — (size;-1/2 — num;-1)

Thus, the amortized cost of a TABLE-INSERT operation is at most 3.

We now turn to the case in which the th operation is TABLE-DELETE. In this
case, num; = num;—; — 1. If a; < 1/2, then we must consider whether the
operation causes the table to contract. If it does not, then size; = size;_; and the
amortized cost of the operation is
Gj = GE +O, -O-1
1 + (size; /2 —num;) — (size;-1/2 — num;—1)

1 + (size; /2 — num;) — (size; /2 — (num; + 1))
