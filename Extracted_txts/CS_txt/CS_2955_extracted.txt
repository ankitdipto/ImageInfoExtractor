Problems for Chapter 17 475

We shall first analyze the structural modifications when only insertions are per-
formed. Let T be a red-black tree, and define ®(7) to be the number of red nodes
in T. Assume that | unit of potential can pay for the structural modifications per-
formed by any of the three cases of RB-INSERT-FIXUP.

c. Let T’ be the result of applying Case 1 of RB-INSERT-FIXuP to 7. Argue that
O(T’) = O(T)—1.

d. When we insert a node into a red-black tree using RB-INSERT, we can break
the operation into three parts. List the structural modifications and potential
changes resulting from lines 1-16 of RB-INSERT, from nonterminating cases
of RB-INSERT-FIXuP, and from terminating cases of RB-INSERT-FIXUP.

e. Using part (d), argue that the amortized number of structural modifications per-
formed by any call of RB-INSERT is O(1).

We now wish to prove that there are O(m) structural modifications when there are
both insertions and deletions. Let us define, for each node x,

0 ifxisred,

1 if x is black and has no red children ,

0. if x is black and has one red child ,

2. if x is black and has two red children .

w(x) =

Now we redefine the potential of a red-black tree T as

OT) = Yo w(x),

xeT
and let T’ be the tree that results from applying any nonterminating case of RB-
INSERT-FIXUP or RB-DELETE-FIXuP to T.

f. Show that ®(7’) < ®(T) — 1 for all nonterminating cases of RB-INSERT-
Fixup. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed
by any call of RB-INSERT-FIxuP is O(1).

g. Show that ®(T’) < ®(T) — | for all nonterminating cases of RB-DELETE-
Fixup. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed
by any call of RB-DELETE-FIXUP is O(1).

h. Complete the proof that in the worst case, any sequence of m RB-INSERT and
RB-DELETE operations performs O(m) structural modifications.
