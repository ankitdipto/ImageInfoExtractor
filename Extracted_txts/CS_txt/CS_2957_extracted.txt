Figure 12.1. Hierarchical decomposition of the operator Build House into a partial-order plan.

 

 

 

say that a plan p correctly implements an operator o if it is a complete and consistent plan for the
problem of achieving the effects of o given the preconditions of 0:

1. p must be consistent. (There is no contradiction in the ordering or variable binding
constraints ofp.)

2. Every effect of o must be asserted by at least one step ofp (and is not denied by some
other, later step ofp).

3. Every precondition of the steps in p must be achieved by a step in p or be one of the
preconditions of o.

This guarantees that it is possible to replace a nonprimitive operator with its decomposition and
have everything hook up properly. Although one will need to check for possible threats arising
from interactions between the newly introduced steps and conditions and the existing steps and
conditions, there is no need to worry about interactions among the steps of the decomposition
itself. Provided there is not too much interaction between the different parts of the plan, hierar-
chical planning allows very complex plans to be built up cumulatively from simpler subplans. It
also allows plans to be generated, saved away, and then re-used in later planning problems
