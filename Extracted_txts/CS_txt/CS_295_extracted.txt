Chapter 29 Linear Programming

whose optimal value is identical to that of the original linear program. When refer-
ring to dual linear programs, we call the original linear program the primal.

Given a primal linear program in standard form, as in (29.16)-(29.18), we define
the dual linear program as

minimize >i y; (29.83)
i=l
subject to m
aii => c¢ forj =1,2,..., n, (29.84)
i=l
yi = 0 fori =1,2,..., m. (29.85)

To form the dual, we change the maximization to a minimization, exchange the
roles of coefficients on the right-hand sides and the objective function, and replace
each less-than-or-equal-to by a greater-than-or-equal-to. Each of the m constraints
in the primal has an associated variable y; in the dual, and each of the n constraints
in the dual has an associated variable x; in the primal. For example, consider the
linear program given in (29.53)-(29.57). The dual of this linear program is

minimize 30y; + 24y. + 36y3 (29.86)
subject to

Yio + 2y2 + 4y3 2 3 (29.87)
Yi + 2y2 + ys = 1 (29.88)
3y. + Sy2 + 2y3 2 2 (29.89)

We shall show in Theorem 29.10 that the optimal value of the dual linear pro-
gram is always equal to the optimal value of the primal linear program. Further-
more, the simplex algorithm actually implicitly solves both the primal and the dual
linear programs simultaneously, thereby providing a proof of optimality.

We begin by demonstrating weak duality, which states that any feasible solu-
tion to the primal linear program has a value no greater than that of any feasible
solution to the dual linear program.

Lemma 29.8 (Weak linear-programming duality)
Let ¥ be any feasible solution to the primal linear program in (29.16)-(29.18) and
let ¥ be any feasible solution to the dual linear program in (29.83)-(29.85). Then,
we have
