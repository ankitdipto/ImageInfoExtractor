Figure 18.1 A B-tree whose keys are the consonants of English. An internal node x containing
x.nkeys has x. + 1 children. All leaves are at the same depth in the tree. The lightly shaded nodes

Figure 18.2 A typical disk drive. It comprises one or more platters (two platters are shown here)
that rotate around a spindle. Each platter is read and written with a head at the end of an arm, Arms
rotate around a common pivot axis. A track is the surface that passes beneath the read/write head
when the head is stationary.

consists of silicon memory chips. This technology is typically more than an order
of magnitude more expensive per bit stored than magnetic storage technology, such
as tapes or disks. Most computer systems also have secondary storage based on
magnetic disks; the amount of such secondary storage often exceeds the amount of
primary memory by at least two orders of magnitude.

Figure 18.2 shows a typical disk drive. The drive consists of one or more plat-
ters, which rotate at a constant speed around a common spindle. A magnetizable
material covers the surface of each platter. The drive reads and writes each platter
by a head at the end of an arm. The arms can move their heads toward or away
