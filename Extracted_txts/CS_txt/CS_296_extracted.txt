Corollary 29.9
Let ¥ be a feasible solution to a primal linear program (A,b,c), and let ¥ be a
feasible solution to the corresponding dual linear program. If

then X and J are optimal solutions to the primal and dual linear programs, respec-
tively.

Proof By Lemma 29.8, the objective value of a feasible solution to the primal
cannot exceed that of a feasible solution to the dual. The primal linear program is
a maximization problem and the dual is a minimization problem. Thus, if feasible
solutions ¥ and y have the same objective value, neither can be improved. .

Before proving that there always is a dual solution whose value is equal to that
of an optimal primal solution, we describe how to find such a solution. When
we ran the simplex algorithm on the linear program in (29.53)—(29.57), the final
iteration yielded the slack form (29.72)-(29.75) with objective z = 28 — x3/6 —
X5/6—2x6/3, B = {1,2,4}, and N = {3,5, 6}. As we shall show below, the basic
solution associated with the final slack form is indeed an optimal solution to the
linear program; an optimal solution to linear program (29.53)-(29.57) is therefore
(X1. ¥2,¥3) = (8,4,0), with objective value (3-8) + (1-4) + (2-0) = 28. As
we also show below, we can read off an optimal dual solution: the negatives of the
coefficients of the primal objective function are the values of the dual variables.
More precisely, suppose that the last slack form of the primal is
