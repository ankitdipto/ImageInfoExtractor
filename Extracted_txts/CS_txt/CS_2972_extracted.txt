Binary Incrementer

The increment microoperation adds one toa numberina register. Forexample,
ifa bit register hasa binary value 0110, it will goto0111 after itis incremented,
This microoperationiseasily implemented witha binary counter (see Fig. 2-10).
Every time the count enable is active, the clock pulse transition increments the
content of the register by one. There may be occasions when the increment
microoperation must be done with a combinational cicuit independent of a
particular register. This can be accomplished by means of half-adders (see
Fig, 1-16) connected in cascade.

The diagram of a 4bit combinational circuit incrementer is shown in
Fig. 48. One of the inputs tothe least significant half-adder (HA)is connected
to logic-1 and the other input is connected to the least significant bit of the
number tobeincremented. The output ca:ry from one half-adderis connected
to one of the inputs of the nest-higher-order half-adder. The circuit receives
the four bits from Acthrough As, adds one to it, and generates the incremented
output in So through 5s. The output carry C, will be 1 only after incrementing
binary 1111. This also causes outputs So through 5; to go to 0.

The circuit of Fig. 48 can be extended to an n-bit binary increreenter by
extending the diagram to include n half-adders. The least significant bit must
haveoneinput connected to logic-1. The other inputs receive the number to
be incremented or the carry from the previous stage.
