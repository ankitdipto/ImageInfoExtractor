By simple algebra, we get t < (n + 1)/2. Taking base-r logarithms of both sides
proves the theorem. .

Here we see the power of B-trees, as compared with red-black trees. Although
the height of the tree grows as O(1g 7) in both cases (recall that ¢ is a constant), for
B-trees the base of the logarithm can be many times larger. Thus, B-trees save a
factor of about lg ¢ over red-black trees in the number of nodes examined for most
tree operations. Because we usually have to access the disk to examine an arbitrary
node in a tree, B-trees avoid a substantial number of disk accesses.
