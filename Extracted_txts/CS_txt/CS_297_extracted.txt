Chapter 29 Linear Programming

Then, to produce an optimal dual solution, we set

i= —Cha; if (n +) eN, (29.91)
. 0 otherwise .

Thus, an optimal solution to the dual linear program defined in (29.86)-(29.90)
is J) = 0 (sineen +1 = 4 € B), Jo = —c5 = 1/6, and J3 = —c§ = 2/3.
Evaluating the dual objective function (29.86), we obtain an objective value of
(30-0) + (24-(1/6)) + (36-(2/3)) = 28, which confirms that the objective value
of the primal is indeed equal to the objective value of the dual. Combining these
calculations with Lemma 29.8 yields a proof that the optimal objective value of the
primal linear program is 28. We now show that this approach applies in general:
we can find an optimal solution to the dual and simultaneously prove that a solution
to the primal is optimal.

 

Theorem 29.10 (Linear-programming duality)

Suppose that SIMPLEX returns values ¥ = (X,,X2....,.X,) for the primal lin-
ear program (A,b,c). Let N and B denote the nonbasic and basic variables for
the final slack form, let c’ denote the coefficients in the final slack form, and let
YH (No... Ym) be defined by equation (29.91). Then X¥ is an optimal so-
lution to the primal linear program, ) is an optimal solution to the dual linear
program, and

Sot = Sas, . (29.92)
j=l i=1

 

 

Proof By Corollary 29.9, if we can find feasible solutions ¥ and j that satisfy
equation (29.92), then X and y must be optimal primal and dual solutions. We
shall now show that the solutions ¥ and j described in the statement of the theorem
satisfy equation (29.92).

Suppose that we run SIMPLEX on a primal linear program, as given in lines
(29.16)-(29.18). The algorithm proceeds through a series of slack forms until it
terminates with a final slack form with objective function

Since SIMPLEX terminated with a solution, by the condition in line 3 we know that
