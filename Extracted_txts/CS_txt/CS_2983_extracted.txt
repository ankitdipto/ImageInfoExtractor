Figure 18.7 _ Inserting keys into a B-tree. The minimum degree for this B-tree is 3, so a node can
hold at most 5 keys. Nodes that are modified by the insertion process are lightly shaded. (a) The
initial tree for this example. (b) The result of inserting B into the initial tree; this is a simple insertion
into a leaf node. (c) The result of inserting Q into the previous tree. The node RST UV splits into
two nodes containing RS and UV, the key T moves up to the root, and Q is inserted in the leftmost
of the two halves (the RS node). (d) The result of inserting L into the previous tree. The root
splits right away, since it is full, and the B-tree grows in height by one. Then L is inserted into the
leaf containing JK. (e) The result of inserting F into the previous tree. The node ABCDE splits
before F is inserted into the rightmost of the two halves (the DE node).
