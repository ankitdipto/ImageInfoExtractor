Arithmetic Circuit

The arithmetic microoperations listed in Table 4-3 can be implemented in one
compositearithmeticcircuit. The basiccomponentof an arithmetic circuit is the
parallel adder. By controlling the data inputs to the adder, it is possible to
obtain different types of arithmetic operations.

The diagram of a 4-bitarithmeticcircuit is shown in Fig. 4-9, It has four
full-adder circuits that constitute the 4-bit adder and four multiplexers for
choosing different operations. There are two 4-bit inputs A and Banda 4-bit
output D. The four inputs from A go directly to the X inputs of the binary
adder. Each of the four inputs from B are connected to the data inputs of the
multiplexers. The multiplexers data inputs also receive the complement of B.
The other two data inputs are connected to logic-0 and logic-1. Logic-Oisa fixed
voltage value (0 volts for TTL integrated circuits) and the logic-1 signal can be
generated through an inverter whose input is Q. The four multiplexers are
controlled by two selection inputs, 5, and S,, The input carry C,, goes to the
carry input of the FA in the least significant position. The other carries are
connected from one stage to the next.

The output of the binary adder is calculated from the following arithmetic
sum:

D=A+Y+Cy

where A is the 4-bit binary number at the X inputs and Y is the 4-bit binary
number at the Y inputs of the binary adder. C,, is the input carry, which can
be equal to 0 or 1. Note that the symbol + in the equation above denotes an
arithmetic plus. By controlling the value of Y with the two selection inputs S;
and S, and making C;, equal to 0 or 1, it is possible to generate the eight
arithmetic microoperations listed in Table 4-4.
