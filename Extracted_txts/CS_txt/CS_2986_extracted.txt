Figure 18.8 Deleting keys from a B-tree, The minimum degree for this B-tree is t = 3, so a node
(other than the root) cannot have fewer than 2 keys. Nodes that are modified are lightly shaded.
(a) The B-tree of Figure 18.7(e). (b) Deletion of F. This is case 1: simple deletion from a leaf.
(c) Deletion of M. This is case 2a: the predecessor L of M moves up to take Mâ€™s position. (d) Dele-
tion of G. This is case 2c: we push G down to make node DEGJK and then delete G from this leaf
(case 1).

We sketch how deletion works instead of presenting the pseudocode. Figure 18.8
illustrates the various cases of deleting keys from a B-tree.

1. If the key k is in node x and x isa leaf, delete the key k from x.
2. If the key k is in node x and x is an internal node, do the following:
