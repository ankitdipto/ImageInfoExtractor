29.4 Duality 883

If we define
c, =0 forall j eB, (29.95)

we can rewrite equation (29.93) as

za + Lexy

jen
=vt+ Very + oxy (because cj = Oif j € B)
jen jeB
atm
=v+ Yea; (because N UB = {1,2,..., n+m}). (29.96)
j=l

For the basic solution ¥ associated with this final slack form, X; = 0 forall 7 € N,
and z = v’. Since all slack forms are equivalent, if we evaluate the original objec-
tive function on X, we must obtain the same objective value:

n nt+m
Mok = vt Voix, (29.97)
j=l j=l
= + ex + Vek
jen jeB
= v +> c}-0) + 20-5) (29.98)
jen jeB

=v.

We shall now show that j, defined by equation (29.91), is feasible for the dual
linear program and that its objective value )" , b;5; equals Yj cjX;. Equa-
tion (29.97) says that the first and last slack forms, evaluated at X, are equal. More
generally, the equivalence of all slack forms implies that for any set of values
X = (X1,%2,.--, X,), we have

oxy =v+ Yi ejxy :
j=l j=l

Therefore, for any particular set of values ¥ = (X1,¥2,..., Xn), we have
