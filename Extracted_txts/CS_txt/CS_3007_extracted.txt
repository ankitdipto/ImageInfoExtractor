the current internal state of the agent's decision process, and ovals to represent the background
information used in the process. The agent program, which is also very simple, is shown in
Figure 2.8. The INTERPRET-INPUT function generates an abstracted description of the current
state from the percept, and the RULE-MATCH function returns the first rule in the set ofrules that
matches the given state description. Although such agents can be implemented very efficiently
(see Chapter 10), their range of applicability is very narrow, as we shall see.

Agents that keep track of the world

The simple reflex agent described before will work only if the correct decision can be made
on the basis of the current percept. If the car in front is a recent model, and has the centrally
mounted brake light now required in the United States, then it will be possible to tell if it is
braking from a single image. Unfortunately, older models have different configurations of tail
