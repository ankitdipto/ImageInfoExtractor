that the solution is feasible for the dual problem. From inequalities (29.94) and
equations (29.95), we have that c <0 forall j =1,2,..., n-+m. Hence, for any
J=1.2,.... n, equations (29.101) imply that

which satisfies the constraints (29.84) of the dual. Finally, since Cc < 0 for each
Jj € NUB, when we set ¥ according to equation (29.91), we have that each y; > 0,
and so the nonnegativity constraints are satisfied as well. .

We have shown that, given a feasible linear program, if INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX
returns a feasible solution, and if SIMPLEX terminates without returning “un-
bounded,” then the solution returned is indeed an optimal solution. We have also
shown how to construct an optimal solution to the dual linear program.

Exercises

29.4-1
Formulate the dual of the linear program given in Exercise 29.3-5.

29.4-2

Suppose that we have a linear program that is not in standard form. We could
produce the dual by first converting it to standard form, and then taking the dual.
It would be more convenient, however, to be able to produce the dual directly.
Explain how we can directly take the dual of an arbitrary linear program.

29.4-3

Write down the dual of the maximum-flow linear program, as given in lines
(29.47)-(29.50) on page 860. Explain how to interpret this formulation as a
minimum-cut problem.

29.4-4

Write down the dual of the minimum-cost-flow linear program, as given in lines
(29.51)-(29.52) on page 862. Explain how to interpret this problem in terms of
graphs and flows.

29.4-5
Show that the dual of the dual of a linear program is the primal linear program.
