Chapter 29 Linear Programming

29.4-6
Which result from Chapter 26 can be interpreted as weak duality for the maximum-
flow problem?

 

29.5 The initial basic feasible solution

In this section, we first describe how to test whether a linear program is feasible,
and if it is, how to produce a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible.
We conclude by proving the fundamental theorem of linear programming, which
says that the SIMPLEX procedure always produces the correct result.

Finding an initial solution

In Section 29.3, we assumed that we had a procedure INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX that
determines whether a linear program has any feasible solutions, and if it does, gives
a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible. We describe this procedure
here.

A linear program can be feasible, yet the initial basic solution might not be
feasible. Consider, for example, the following linear program:

maximize 2x; — X2 (29.102)
subject to

2x, -— X% < 2 (29.103)

xX, — 5x, < -4 (29.104)

X1,X2 > 0. (29.105)

If we were to convert this linear program to slack form, the basic solution would
set Xx; = 0 and x, = 0. This solution violates constraint (29.104), and so it is not a
feasible solution. Thus, INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX cannot just return the obvious slack
form. In order to determine whether a linear program has any feasible solutions,
we will formulate an auxiliary linear program. For this auxiliary linear program,
we can find (with a little work) a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible.
Furthermore, the solution of this auxiliary linear program determines whether the
initial linear program is feasible and if so, it provides a feasible solution with which
we can initialize SIMPLEX.

Lemma 29.11
Let L be a linear program in standard form, given as in (29.16)-(29.18). Let xo be
a new variable, and let Layx be the following linear program with n + 1 variables:
