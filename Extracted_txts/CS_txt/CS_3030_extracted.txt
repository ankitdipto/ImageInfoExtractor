function REFLEX-AGENT-WITH-STaTE( percept) returns action
static: state, a description of the current world state
rules, a set of condition-action rules

state — UpDaTE-STATE(state, percept)
rule — RULE-MATCH(state, rules)
action — RULE-ACTION[rule]}

state — UPDATE-STATE(state, action)
return action

 

 

Figure 210 A reflex agent with internal state. It works by finding a rule whose condition
matches the current situation (as defined by the percept and the stored internal state) and then

 

 

doing the action associated with that rule.

 

Notice that decision-making of this kind is fundamentally different from the condition-
action rules described earlier, in that it involves consideration of the future—both "What will
happen if I do such-and-such?" and "Will that make me happy?" In the reflex agent designs,
this information is not explicitly used, because the designer has precomputed the correct action
for various cases. The reflex agent brakes when it sees brake lights. A goal-based agent, in
principle, could reason that if the car in front has its brake lights on, it will slow down. From
the way the world usually evolves, the only action that will achieve the goal of not hitting other
cars is to brake. Although the goal-based agent appears less efficient, it is far more flexible. Ifit
starts to rain, the agent can update its knowledge of how effectively its brakes will operate; this
will automatically cause all of the relevant behaviors to be altered to suit the new conditions. For
the reflex agent, on the other hand, we would have to rewrite a large number of condition-action
