function S1TUATED-PLANNING-AGENT( percept) returns an action
static: KB, a knowledge base (includes action descriptions)
p, aplan, initially NoPlan
1, a counter, initially 0, indicating time
G, agoal

TELL(KB, MAKE-PERCEPT-SENTENCE( percept, t))
current — STATE-DESCRIPTION(KB, f)
EFFECTS(START( p)) — current
if p =NoPlan then

G — ASK(KB, MAKE-GOAL-QUERY(1))

p — MAKE-PLAN(current,G, KB)
action — NoOp (the default)

Termination:

if there are no open preconditions and p has no steps other than START and FINISH then
p —NoPlan and skip remaining steps

Resolving standard flaws:
resolve any open condition by adding a causal link from any existing
possibly prior step or a new step
resolve potential threats by promotion or demotion

Remove unsupported causal links:
if there is a causal link START “ , S protecting a proposition c
that no longer holds in START then
remove the link and any associated bindings

Extend causal links back to earliest possible step:
if there is a causal link S;— © 5; such that
another step S, exists with $, < Sjandthe link S, ", 5; is safe then
replace 5) ©. S, with S,_£. S;

Remove redundant actions:
remove any step S that supplies no causal links

Execute actions when readyfor execution:
if a step $ in the plan other than FINISH satisfies the following
(2) all preconditions satisfied by START;
(b) no other steps necessarily between START and S; and
(c) S does not threaten any causal link inp then
add ordering constraints to force all other steps after S
remove S from p, and all causal links to and from $
action — the action in 5
‘TELL(KB, MAKE-ACTION-SENTENCE(action, 1)
rod
return action
