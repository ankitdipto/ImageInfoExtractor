 

UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND
REASONING

 

 

Parts III and IV covered the logical agent approach to AI. We used first-order
logic as the language to represent facts, and we showed how standard inference
procedures and planning algorithms can derive new beliefs and hence identify
desirable actions. In Part V, we reexamine the very foundation of the logical
approach, describing how it must be changed to deal with the often unavoidable
problem of uncertain information. Probability theory provides the basis for our
treatment of systems that reason under uncertainty. Also, because actions are
no longer certain to achieve goals, agents will need ways of weighing up the
desirability of goals and the likelihood of achieving them. For this, we use utility
theory. Probability theory and utility theory together constitute decision theory,
which allows us to build rational agents for uncertain worlds.

Chapter 14 covers the basics of probability theory, including the repre-
sentation language for uncertain beliefs. Belief networks, a powerful tool for
tepresenting and reasoning with uncertain knowledge, are described in detail
in Chapter 15, along with several other formalisms for handling uncertainty.
Chapter 16 develops utility theory and decision theory in some depth. Finally,
Chapter 17 describes the full decision-theoretic agent design for uncertain envi-
ronments, thereby generalizing the planning methods of Part IV.
