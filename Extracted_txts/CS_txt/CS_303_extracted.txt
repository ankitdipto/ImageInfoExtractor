Then L is feasible if and only if the optimal objective value of Laux is 0.

Proof Suppose that L has a feasible solution ¥ = (X1.X2..... X,). Then the
solution X9 = 0 combined with X is a feasible solution to La. with objective
value 0. Since x» > 0 is a constraint of La, and the objective function is to
maximize —Xo, this solution must be optimal for Laux.

Conversely, suppose that the optimal objective value of Lax is 0. Then ¥) = 0,
and the remaining solution values of X satisfy the constraints of L. .

We now describe our strategy to find an initial basic feasible solution for a linear

program L in standard form:

INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX (A, b,c)

RwNe

let k be the index of the minimum b;
ifh, =>0 // is the initial basic solution feasible?
return ({1,2,....2}.{n+1.n+2,..., n+m},A,b,c,0)
form Laux by adding —Xp to the left-hand side of each constraint
and setting the objective function to —Xo
let (N, B, A, b,c, v) be the resulting slack form for Laux
l=n+k
1 Lux has n + 1 nonbasic variables and m basic variables.
(N, B, A,b,c,v) = Pivot(N, B, A,b,c,v,1,0)
// The basic solution is now feasible for Lux.
iterate the while loop of lines 3-12 of SIMPLEX until an optimal solution
to Laux is found
if the optimal solution to Layx sets Xp to 0
if Xo is basic
perform one (degenerate) pivot to make it nonbasic
from the final slack form of Laux, remove Xo from the constraints and
restore the original objective function of L, but replace each basic
variable in this objective function by the right-hand side of its
associated constraint
return the modified final slack form
else return “infeasible”
