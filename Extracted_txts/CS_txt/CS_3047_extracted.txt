a proposition in terms of the probability of the proposition itself:
P(AV =A) = P(A) + P(nA)- P(A AA) (by 3 with B= =A)
P(True) = P(A) + P(7A) - P(False) (by logical equivalence)
= P(A) +P(7A) (by 2)
P(A) = 1 - P(A) (by algebra)

Why the axioms of probability are reasonable

The axioms ofprobability can be seen as restricting the set of probabilistic beliefs that an agent can
hold. This is somewhat analogous to the logical case, where a logical agent cannot simultaneously
believe.4, B, and â€”(A A B), for example. There is, however, an additional complication. In the
logical case, the semantic definition of conjunction means that at least one of the three beliefs
just mentioned must be false in the world, so it is unreasonable for an agent to believe all three.
With probabilities, on the other hand, statements refer not to the world directly, but to the agent's
own state ofknowledge. Why, then, can an agent not hold the following set of beliefs, given that
these probability assignments clearly violate the third axiom?

P(A) = 04
P(B) = 03 42)
P(A AB) = 00 ~

 

P(A VB) = 08
This kind of question has been the subject of decades of intense debate between those who
advocate the use of probabilities as the only legitimate form for degrees of belief, and those who
advocate alternative approaches. Here, we give one argument for the axioms of probability, first
stated in 1931 by Bruno de Finetti.
