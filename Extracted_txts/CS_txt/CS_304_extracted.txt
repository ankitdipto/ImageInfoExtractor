Chapter 29 Linear Programming

INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX works as follows. In lines 1-3, we implicitly test the
basic solution to the initial slack form for L given by N = {1,2,..., ny, B=
{n+1.n4+2,..., n+ m}, X; = 5; for alli € B, and xX; = 0 for all j € N.
(Creating the slack form requires no explicit effort, as the values of A, b, and c are
the same in both slack and standard forms.) If line 2 finds this basic solution to be
feasible—that is, ¥; > 0 for all i ¢ N U B—then line 3 returns the slack form.
Otherwise, in line 4, we form the auxiliary linear program Lyx as in Lemma 29.11.
Since the initial basic solution to L is not feasible, the initial basic solution to the
slack form for Lux cannot be feasible either. To find a basic feasible solution, we
perform a single pivot operation. Line 6 selects / = n +k as the index of the
basic variable that will be the leaving variable in the upcoming pivot operation.
Since the basic variables are Xn41.Xn+2.+++5 Xn+m, the leaving variable x; will be
the one with the most negative value. Line 8 performs that call of PIVOT, with
Xo entering and x, leaving. We shall see shortly that the basic solution resulting
from this call of PIVOT will be feasible. Now that we have a slack form for which
the basic solution is feasible, we can, in line 10, repeatedly call PIVOT to fully
solve the auxiliary linear program. As the test in line 11 demonstrates, if we find
an optimal solution to Lx. With objective value 0, then in lines 12-14, we create
a slack form for L for which the basic solution is feasible. To do so, we first,
in lines 12-13, handle the degenerate case in which xo may still be basic with
value X) = 0. In this case, we perform a pivot step to remove x from the basis,
using any e € N such that doe # 0 as the entering variable. The new basic
solution remains feasible; the degenerate pivot does not change the value of any
variable. Next we delete all x9 terms from the constraints and restore the original
objective function for L. The original objective function may contain both basic
and nonbasic variables. Therefore, in the objective function we replace each basic
variable by the right-hand side of its associated constraint. Line 15 then returns
this modified slack form. If, on the other hand, line 11 discovers that the original
linear program L is infeasible, then line 16 returns this information.

We now demonstrate the operation of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX on the linear pro-
gram (29.102)-(29.105). This linear program is feasible if we can find nonneg-
ative values for x; and x2 that satisfy inequalities (29.103) and (29.104). Using
Lemma 29.11, we formulate the auxiliary linear program

By Lemma 29.11, if the optimal objective value of this auxiliary linear program
is 0, then the original linear program has a feasible solution. If the optimal objective
