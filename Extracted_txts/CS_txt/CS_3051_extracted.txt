Section 14.4. Bayes’ Rule and Its Use 427

 

That is, we expect only one in 5000 patients with a stiffneck to have meningitis. Notice that
even though a stiff neck is strongly indicated by meningitis (probability 0.5), the probability of
meningitis in the patient remains small. This is because the prior on stiffnecks is much higher
than that for meningitis.

One obvious question to ask is why one might have available the conditional probability
in one direction but not the other. In the meningitis case, perhaps the doctor knows that 1 out
of 5000 patients with stiff necks has meningitis, and therefore has no need to use Bayes’ tule.

e Unfortunately, diagnostic knowledge is often more tenuous than causal knowledge. If there is a
I ae sudden epidemic of meningitis, the unconditional probability of meningitis, P(M), will go up.
The doctor who derived P(M|S)from statistical observation of patients before the epidemic will
have no idea how to update the value, but the doctor who computes P(M|S)from the other three
values will see that P(M|S) should go up proportionately to P(M). Most importantly, the causal
information P(S|M)is unaffected by the epidemic, because it simply reflects the way meningitis
works. The use of this kind of direct causal or model-based knowledge provides the crucial
robustness needed to make probabilistic systems feasible in the real world.

Normalization

Consider again the equation for calculating the probability of meningitis given a stiff neck:
P(S|M)P(M)
Pl =
(MS) PS)
Suppose we are also concerned with the possibility that the patient is suffering from whiplash W
given a stiff neck:

P(S|W)PCW)
PWS) = —>——
(Wis) PES)
Bee Moon Comparing these two equations, we see that in order to compute the relative likelihood of

meningitis and whiplash, given a stiffneck, we need not assess the prior probability P(S) of a stiff
neck. To put numbers on the equations, suppose that P(S\W) = 0.8 and P(W)= 1/1000. Then

P(M\S) _ P(S|M)P(M)_ 0.5 x 1/50000__ 1

P(W|S) ~ P(S|W)P(W)~ 08 x 1/1000 ~ 80
That is, whiplash is 80 times more likely than meningitis, given a stiffneck.

In some cases, relative likelihood is sufficient for decision making, but when, as in this
case, the two possibilities yield radically different utilities for various treatment actions, one needs
exact values in order to make rational decisions. It is still possible to avoid direct assessment of
the prior probability of the "symptoms," by considering an exhaustive set of cases. For example,
‘we can write equations for M and for =M:

 

Pulp = neuen
P(-am|s) = PEIMPCM) san

Adding these two equations, and using the fact that P(M|S)+ P(>M|S)= 1, we obtain
P(S) = P(S|M)P(M)+ P(S|>M)P(>=M)
