of which can be achieved with certainty, utility provides a way in which the likelihood of success
can be weighed up against the importance of the goals.

In Chapter 16, we show that any rational agent can be described as possessing a utility
function. An agent that possesses an explicit utility functiontherefore can make rational decisions,
but may have tocompare the utilities achieved by different courses of actions. Goals, although
cruder, enable the agent to pick an action right away if it satisfies the goal. In some cases,
moreover, a utility function can be translated into a set of goals, such that the decisions made by
a goal-based agent using those goals are identical to those made by the utility-based agent.

The overall utility-based agent structure appears in Figure 2.12, Actual utility-based agent
programs appeal in Chapter 5, where we examine game-playing programs that must make fine
distinctions amoag various board positions; and in Chapter 17, where we tackle the general
problem of designing decision-making agents.

2.4 ENVIRONMENTS

In this section and in the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will see how to couple an agent
to an environment. Section 2.3 introduced several different kinds of agents and environments.
In all cases, however, the nature of the connection between them is the same: actions are done
by the agent on the environment, which in turn provides percepts to the agent. First, we will
describe the different types of environments and how they affect the design of agents. Then we
will describe environment programs that can be used as testbeds for agent programs.
