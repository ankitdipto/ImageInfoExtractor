Bayes’ Rule and Its Use 429

 

‘CONDITIONAL
INDEPENDENCE

When Catch is observed, we can apply Bayes” rule with Toothache as the constant conditioning
context (see Exercise 14.5):
. _ . P(Catch|Toothache A Cavity)
P(Cavity|ToothacheA Catch) = P(Cavity|Toothache) P(Catch\Toothachey)
P(Toothache|Cavity) P(Catch|Toothache A. Cavity)

P(Toothache) P(Catch|Toothache)
Thus, in Bayesian updating, as each new piece of evidence is observed, the beliefin the unknown
variable is multiplied by a factor that depends on the new evidence. Exercise 14.8 asks you to
prove that this process is order-independent, as we would hope.

So far we are not out of the woods, because the multiplication factor depends not just
on the new evidence, but also on the evidence already obtained. . Finding a value for the nu-
merator, P(Catch|Toothache A Cavity), is not necessarily any easier than finding a value for
P(Toothache A Catch|Cavity). We will need to make a substantive assumption in order to sim-
plify our expressions. The key observation, in the cavity case, is that the cavity is the direct cause
of both the toothache and the probe catching in the tooth. Once we know the patient has a cavity,
we do not expect the probability of the probe catching to depend on the presence of a toothache;
similarly, the probe catching is not going to change the probability that the cavity is causing a
toothache. Mathematically, these properties are written as

P(Catch|Cavity A Toothache) = P(Catch|Cavity)

P(Toothache|Cavity A Catch) - P(Toothache|Cavity)

These equations express the conditional independence of Toothache and Catch given Cavity.
Given conditional independence, we can simplify the equation for updating:
P(Toothaéné\Cavity) — P(Catch|Cavity)
P(Toothache) — P(Catch|Toothache)
There is still the term P(Catch|Toothache), which might seem to involve considering all pairs
(triples, etc.) of symptoms, but in fact this term goes away. Notice that the product of the
denominators is P(Catch|Toothache)P(Toothache), or P(Toothache A Catch). We can elimi-
nate this term by normalization, as before, provided we also assess P(Toothache|=Cavity)and
P(Catch|>Cavity). Thus, we are back where we were with a single piece of evidence: we just
need to evaluate the prior for the cause, and the conditional probabilities of each of its effects

We can also use conditional independence in the multivalued case. To say that X and Y are
independent given Z, we write

P(X|Y,Z) = PCX|Z)
which represents a set of individual conditional independence statements. The corresponding
simplification of Bayes’ rule for multiple evidence is

P(Z\X, Y) = aP(Z)P(X|Z)P(Y|Z)
where a is a normalization constant such that the entries in P(Z|X, Y) sum to 1.

It is important to remember that this simplified form of Bayesian updating only works
when the conditional independence relationships hold. Conditional independence information
therefore is crucial to making probabilistic systems work effectively. In Chapter 15, we show
how it can be represented and manipulated in a systematic fashion.

= P(Cavity

P(Cavity| Toothache \ Catch) = P(Cavity)
