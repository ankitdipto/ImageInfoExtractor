Chapter 14. Uncertainty

 

about rationality. Then draw another version of the table where P(4 V B)=0.7. Explain why it
is rational to have this probability, even though the table shows one case that is a loss and three
that just break even. (Hint: what is Agent 1 committed to about the probability of each of the
four cases, especially the case that is a loss?)

14.5 It is quite often useful to consider the effect of some specific propositions in the context
of some general background evidence that remains fixed, rather than in the complete absence of
information. The following questions ask you to prove more general versions of the product rule
and Bayes' rule, with respect to some background evidence E:

a. Prove the conditionalized version of the general product rule:
P(A,B\E) = P(A|B,E)P(B|E)
b. Prove the conditionalized version of Bayes’ rule:

PBA, C)PCA|Cy

PAIB.C)= Fac)

146 — Show that the statement
P(ABIC) = PA|C)P(B|C)

is equivalent to the statement
P(AIB, C)= P(AIC)

and also to
P(BIA, C) = P(BIC)

147 In this exercise, you will complete the normalization calculation for the meningitis exam-
ple. First, make up a suitable value for P(S|>M), and use it to calculate unnormalized values for
P(M\S) and P(=M|S) (ie., ignoring the P(S) term in the Bayes’ rule expression). Now normalize
these values so that they add to |.

148 Show that the degree of beliefafter applying the Bayesian updating process is independent
of the order in which the pieces of evidence arrive. That is, show that P(A\B, C) = P(A\C,B)
using the Bayesian updating tule.

149 This exercise investigates the way in which conditional independence relationships affect
the amount of information needed for probabilistic calculations.
a. Suppose we wish to calculate P(H|E), £2), and we have no conditional independence
information. Which of the following sets of numbers are sufficient for the calculation?
@) P(E), £2), PH), Er |H), P(E2|H)
(i) P(E) ,E2), PUA), P(E), Eo |H)
ii) P(H), P(E, |), P(E2|H)
b. Suppose we know that P(E,|H, E2)= P(E; \H) for all values of H, £1, Ex. Now which of
the above three sets are sufficient?
