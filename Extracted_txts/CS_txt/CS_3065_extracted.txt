Figure 15.2 A typical belief network with conditional probabilities. The letters B, E, 4, J, and
M stand for Burglary, Earthquake, Alarm, JohnCalls, and MaryCalls, respectively. All variables
(nodes) are Boolean, so the probability of, say, =P(A) in any row of its table is 1 â€” P(A).

 

 

 

Representing the joint probability distribution

A belief network provides a complete description of the domain. Every entry in the joint
probability distribution can be calculated from the information in the network. A generic entry
in the joint is the probability of a conjunction of particular assignments to each variable, such
as P(X; =x, A... AX,=x,). We use the notation P(x, ,) as an abbreviation for this. The
value of this entry is given by the following formula:

 

POs etn) = | | Plai|Parents(X)) (15.1)
i=l

Thus, each entry in the joint is represented by the product of the appropriate elements of the
conditional probability tables (CPTs) in the belief network. The CPTs therefore provide a
decomposed representation of the joint.

To illustrate this, we can calculate the probability of the event that the alarm has sounded
but neither a burglary nor an earthquake has occurred, and both John and Mary call. We use
single-letter names for the variables:

PJAMAAA-BA-E)
PU|A)P(M|A)P(A|>BA 7E)P(>B)P(>E)
= 0.90 x 0.70 x 0.001 x 0.999 x 0.998 = 0.00062
Section 14.3 explained that the joint distribution can be used to answer any query about
the domain. Ifa belief network is a representation of the joint, then it too can be used to answer
any query. Trivially, this can be done by first computing all the joint entries. We will see below
that there are much better methods.
