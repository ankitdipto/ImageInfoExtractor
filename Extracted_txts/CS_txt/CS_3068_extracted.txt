What happens if we happen to choose the wrong order? Let us consider the burglary
example again. Suppose we decide to add the nodes in the order MaryCalls,JohnCalls, Alarm,
Burglary, Earthquake. We get a somewhat more complicated network (Figure 15.3, left). The
process goes as follows:

Adding MaryCalls: no parents

Adding JohnCalls: if Mary calls, that probably means the alarm has gone off, which of |

course would make it more likely that John calls. Therefore, there is a dependence:
P(JohnCalls|MaryCalls)Â¢ +P(JohnCalls)

Hence, JohnCalls needs MaryCalls as a parent.

Adding Alarm: clearly, if both call, it is more likely that the alarm has gone off than ifjust
one or neither call, so we need both MaryCalls and JohnCalls as parents.

Adding Burglary: if we know the alam state, then the call (or lack of it) from John or
Mary might tell us about whether our telephone is ringing or whether Mary's music is on 4
loud, but it does not give us further information about a burglary. That is,

P(Burglary|Alarm, JohnCalls, MaryCalls) = P(Burglary|Alarm)

Hence we need just Alarm as parent

Adding Earthquake: if the alarm is on, it is more likely that there has been an earthquake
(because the alarm is an earthquake detector of sorts). But if we know there has been a
burglary, then that accounts for the alarm and the probability of an earthquake would be
only slightly above normal. Hence we need both Alarm and Burglary as parents:

P(Earthquake| Burglary, Alarm,JohnCalls, MaryCalls) = P(Earthquake|Burglary.Alarm)

The resulting network has two more links than the original network in Figure 15.1, and requires
three more probabilities to be specified. But the worst part is that some of the links represent
