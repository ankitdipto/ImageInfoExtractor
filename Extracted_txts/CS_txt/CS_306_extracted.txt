29.5 The initial basic feasible solution 889

value of this auxiliary linear program is negative, then the original linear program
does not have a feasible solution.
We write this linear program in slack form, obtaining

id — Xo
X3 = 2 — 2x, + xX. + Xo
Xe = -4 — x + 5x2 + X%.-

We are not out of the woods yet, because the basic solution, which would set
X4 = —4, is not feasible for this auxiliary linear program. We can, however, with
one call to PIVOT, convert this slack form into one in which the basic solution is
feasible. As line 8 indicates, we choose Xo to be the entering variable. In line 6, we
choose as the leaving variable x4, which is the basic variable whose value in the
basic solution is most negative. After pivoting, we have the slack form

Z = —-4 -— XM + 5X2 - XM
Xo = 4 + % — SX. + Xa
x = 6 — x, — 4x. + XX.

The associated basic solution is (Xo, ¥1, ¥2,X3,%4) = (4,0,0,6,0), which is feasi-
ble. We now repeatedly call Prvor until we obtain an optimal solution to Lay. In
this case, one call to PrvoT with x2 entering and Xo leaving yields

Z = —- Xp

This slack form is the final solution to the auxiliary problem. Since this solution
has x9 = 0, we know that our initial problem was feasible. Furthermore, since
Xo = 0, we can just remove it from the set of constraints. We then restore the
original objective function, with appropriate substitutions made to include only
nonbasic variables. In our example, we get the objective function

axy-m=In-(-342 =).

Setting x9 = 0 and simplifying, we get the objective function
