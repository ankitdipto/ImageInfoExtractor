rather are summarized as "noise parameters." If P(Fever|Cold) = 0.4, P(Fever|Flu) = 0.8, and
P(Fever|Malaria)= 0.9, then the noise parameters are 0.6, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively. Ifno parent
node is true, then the output node is false with 100% certainty. If exactly one parent is true, then
the output is false with probability equal to the noise parameter for that node. In general, the
probability that the output node is False is just the product of the noise parameters for all the
input nodes that are true. For this example, we have the following:

 

 

 

Cold Flu Malaria | P(Fever) | P(=Fever)

F F F 0.0 10

F F T 09 0.1

F T F 08 0.2

F T T 0.98 0.02 =0.2 x 0.1

T F F 04 06

T F T | 0.94 0.06 =0.6x 0.1

T T F 0.88 0.12 6x 0.2

T T T 0.988 0.012=0.6 < 0.2 x 0.1

 

 

 

 

 

In general, noisy logical relationships in which a variable depends on k parents can be described
using O(k) parameters instead of O(2*) for the full conditional probability table. This makes
assessment and learning much easier. For example, the CPSC network (Pradhan et al., 1994)
uses noisy-OR and noisy-MAX, and requires "only" 8,254 values instead of 133,931,430 for a
network with full CPTs.

Conditional independence relations in belief networks

The preceding analysis shows that a belief network expresses the conditional independence of a
node and its predecessors, given its parents, and uses this independence to design a construction
method for networks. If we want to design inference algorithms, however, we will need to know
whether more general conditional independences hold. If we are given a network, is it possible
to "read off" whether a set of nodes X is independent of another set Y, given a set of evidence
nodes E/ The answer is yes, and the method is provided by the notion of direction-dependent
separation or d-separation.

First, we will say what d-separation is good for. [fevery undirected path from a node in
X to a node in Y is d-separated by E, then X and Y are conditionally independent given E. The
definition of d-separation is somewhat complicated. We will need to appeal to it several times in
constructing our inference algorithms. Once this is done, however, the process of constructing
and using belief networks does not involve any uses of d-separation.

A set of nodes E d-separates two sets of nodes X¥ and Y if every undirected path from a
node in X to a node in Y is blocked given £. A path is blocked given a set of nodes £ if there 18
anode Z on the path for which one of three conditions holds:

1, Z is in E and Zhas one arrow on the path leading in and one arrow out

2 An undirected path is a path through the network that ignores the direction of the arrows.
