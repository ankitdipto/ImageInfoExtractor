2. Zis in E and Z has both path arrows leading out
3. Neither Z nor any descendant of Z is in £, and both path arrows lead in to Z.

Figure 15.4 shows these three cases. The proof that d-separated nodes are conditionally indepen-
dent is also complicated. We will use Figure 15.5 to give examples of the three cases:

1, Whether there is Gas in the car and whether the car Radio plays are independent given
evidence about whether the SparkPlugs fire.

2. Gas and Radio are independent if it is known if the Battery works.

3. Gas and Radio are independent given no evidence at all. But they are dependent given
evidence about whether the car Starts. For example, if the car does not start, then the radio
playing is increased evidence that we are out of gas. Gas and Radio are also dependent
given evidence about whether the car Moves, because that is enabled by the car starting.

every path from Xto Yis blocked, then we say that E d-separates X and ¥.

The basic task for any probabilistic inference system is to compute the posterior probability
distribution for a set of query variables, given exact values for some evidence variables. That
is, the system computes P(Query|Evidence). In the alarm example, Burglary is an obvious query
variable, and JohnCalls and MaryCalls could serve as evidence variables. Of course, belief
networks are flexible enough so that any node can serve as either a query or an evidence variable
There is nothing to stop us from asking P(Alarm|ohnCalls, Earthquake), although it would be
somewhat unusual. In general, an agent gets values for evidence variables from its percepts (or
ce from other reasoning), and asks about the possible values ofother variables so that it can decide
