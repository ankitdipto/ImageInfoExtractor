what action to take. The two functions we need are BELIEF-NET-TELL, for adding evidence to the
network, and BELIEF-NET-ASK, for computing the posterior probability distribution for a given
query variable.

The nature of probabilistic inferences

Before plunging into the details of the inference algorithms, it is worthwhile to examine the kinds
of things such algorithms can achieve. We will see that a single mechanism can account for a
very wide variety of plausible inferences under uncertainty.

Consider the problem of computing P(Burglary|JohnCalls),the probability that there is
a burglary given that John calls. This task is quite tricky for humans, and therefore for many
reasoning systems that attempt to encode human judgment. The difficulty is not the complexity
of the problem, but keeping the reasoning straight. An incorrect but all-too-common line of
reasoning starts by observing that when the alarm goes off, JohnCalls will be true 90% of the
time. The alarm is fairly accurate at reflecting burglaries, so P(Burglary|JohnCalls)should also
be about 0.9, or maybe 0.8 at worst. The problem is that this line of reasoning ignores the prior
probability of John calling. Over the course of 1000 days, we expect one burglary, for which
John is very likely to call. However, John also calls with probability 0.05 when there actually is
NO alarmâ€”about 50 times over 1000 days. Thus, we expect to receive about 50 false alarms from
John for every 1 burglary, so P(Burglary|JohnCalls)is about 0.02. In fact, if we carry out the
exact computation, we find that the true value is 0,016. It is less than our 0.02 estimate because
the alarm is not perfect.

Now suppose that as soon as we get offthe phone with John, Mary calls. We are now inter-
ested in incrementally updating our network to give P(Burglary|JohnCallsA MaryCalls). Again,
humans often overestimate this value; the correct answer is only 0.29. We can also determine
that P(Alarm|JohnCalls \MaryCalls) is 0.76 and P(Earthquake|JohnCalls A MaryCalls) is 0.18.
