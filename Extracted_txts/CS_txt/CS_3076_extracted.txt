to the parents and children of the query variable X.

 

 

 

Our derivation will work by applying Bayes’ rule and other standard methods for manipulating
probability expressions, until we have massaged the formulas into something that looks like a
recursive instance ofthe original problems. Along the way, we will use simplifications sanctioned
by the conditional independence relationships inherent in the network structure.

The total evidence E consists of the evidence above X and the evidence below X, since we
are assuming that Y itself is not inZ. Hence, we have

P(X|E) = P(X|Ex, EX)
To separate the contributions of EY and Ey , we apply the conditionalized version of Bayes’ rule
(Equation (14.4)) keeping Ey as fixed background evidence:
PEE |X, EPOXIED)

PlEx |EX)
Because X d-separates Fy from Ey in the network, we can use conditional independence to
simplify the first term in the numerator. Also, we can treat 1/P(Ey £%)as a normalizing constant,
giving us

P(X|E)= aP(Ex |X)P(X|EX)
So now we just need to compute the two terms P(E \X) and P(X|E{). The latter is easier, so we
shall look at it first.

P(X|EX EX) =
