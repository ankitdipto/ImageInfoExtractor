Chapter 15. Probabilistic Reasoning Systems

 

We compute P(X|E%) by considering all the possible configurations of the parents of X,
and how likely they are given Ef. Given each configuration, we know the probability of Y
directly from the CPT; we then average those probabilities, weighted by the likelihood of each
configuration. To say this formally, let U be the vector of parents Ul, .... U,,, and let u be an
assignment of values to them.* Then we have

P(X|EX) = > P(X |u, EX) PulEX)

Now U d-separates XY from £%, so we can simplify the first term to P(X|u). We can simplify the
second term by noting that £f d-separates each U; from the others, and by remembering that the
probability of a conjunction of independent variables is equal to the product of their individual
probabilities. This gives us

POXIEX) = 2 Pw) TT Poul EX)
o i
The final step is to simplify the last term of this equation by partitioning EX into Ey,\x,* *- .Ey,\x

(the separate boxes in Figure 15.7) and using the fact that Ey,\x d-separates U; from all the other
evidence in EY. So that gives us

PCX|EX) = > P(X|u) [] PlEvx)
v i
which we can plug into our earlier equation to yield

PORE) = oPCEXIX) D> PCX|w) T] PUi|Ew\x) (15.3)
m i

Finally, this is starting to look like an algorithm: P(X{u) is a lookup in the conditional probability
table of X, and P(U;|Ey,\x) is arecursive instance of the original problem, which was to compute
P(X|E)— that is, P(X|E\ ). Note that the set of evidence variables in the recursive call is a proper
subset of those in the original call—a good sign that the algorithm will terminate

Now we return to P(£,|X), with an eye toward coming up with another recursive solution.
In this case we average over the values of Y;, the children of X, but we will also need to include -
Y;’sparents. We let Z; be the parents of Y, other than X, and let z; be an assignment of values to
the parents. The derivation is similar to the previous one. First, because the evidence in each ¥r
box is conditionally independent of the others given X, we get

P(EX |X) = T] P(Ey,\x|X)
Averaging over Y, and z; yields

PCEY [X) = n E E P(Ey\dX yi. 2:)PO%, 2: |X)
