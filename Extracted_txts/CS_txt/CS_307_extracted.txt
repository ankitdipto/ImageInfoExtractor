This slack form has a feasible basic solution, and we can return it to procedure
SIMPLEX.
We now formally show the correctness of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX.

Lemma 29.12

If a linear program L has no feasible solution, then INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns
“infeasible.” Otherwise, it returns a valid slack form for which the basic solution
is feasible.

Proof First suppose that the linear program L has no feasible solution. Then by
Lemma 29.11, the optimal objective value of Lax, defined in (29.106)-(29.108),
is nonzero, and by the nonnegativity constraint on Xo, the optimal objective value
must be negative. Furthermore, this objective value must be finite, since setting
x; = 0, fori = 1,2,.... n, and Xo = |min/_, {b;}| is feasible, and this solution
has objective value —|min7"_, {b;}|. Therefore, line 10 of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX
finds a solution with a nonpositive objective value. Let X be the basic solution
associated with the final slack form. We cannot have Xp = 0, because then Laux
would have objective value 0, which contradicts that the objective value is negative.
Thus the test in line 11 results in line 16 returning “infeasible.”

Suppose now that the linear program L does have a feasible solution. From
Exercise 29.3-4, we know that if b; > 0 fori = 1,2..... m, then the basic solution
associated with the initial slack form is feasible. In this case, lines 2-3 return the
slack form associated with the input. (Converting the standard form to slack form
is easy, since A, b, and c are the same in both.)

In the remainder of the proof, we handle the case in which the linear program is
feasible but we do not return in line 3. We argue that in this case, lines 4-10 find a
feasible solution to La, with objective value 0. First, by lines 1-2, we must have

be <0.
and
by <b; foreachie B. (29.112)

In line 8, we perform one pivot operation in which the leaving variable x; (recall
that / = n +k, so that b; < 0) is the left-hand side of the equation with mini-
mum J;, and the entering variable is xo, the extra added variable. We now show
