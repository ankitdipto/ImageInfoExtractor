is not independent, because the row must sum to 1. In Figure 15.9, we dropped one of the two
columns, but here we show all four.)

The tricky part about clustering is choosing the right meganodes. There are several ways
to make this choice, but all of them ultimately produce meganodes with large probability tables.
Despite this problem, clustering methods are currently the most effective approach for exact
evaluation of multiply connected networks.

Cutset conditioning methods

The cutset conditioning method takes the opposite approach. Instead of transforming the
network into one complex polytree, this method transforms the network into several simpler -
