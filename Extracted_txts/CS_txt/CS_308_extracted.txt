29.5 The initial basic feasible solution 891

that after this pivot, all entries of b are nonnegative, and hence the basic solution
to Laux is feasible. Letting ¥ be the basic solution after the call to PrvoT, and
letting b and B be values returned by PrvoT, Lemma 29.1 implies that

gy oP Miebe iki e BKe}, (29.113)
bi /dte ifi=e.

The call to PrvorT in line 8 has e = 0. If we rewrite inequalities (29.107), to
include coefficients ajo,

Yaijxj <b; fori =1,2,....m, (29.114)
j=0
then
din = Gie = —1 foreachie B. (29.115)

(Note that ajo is the coefficient of xo as it appears in inequalities (29.114), not
the negation of the coefficient, because Lyx is in standard rather than slack form.)
Since / € B, we also have that aje = —1. Thus, bj/aje > 0, and so Xe > 0. For
the remaining basic variables, we have

X = b- iebe (by equation (29.113))
= bj; —die(bi/dje) (by line 3 of Pivot)
= b-h (by equation (29.115) and aje = —1)
> 0 (by inequality (29.112)) ,

which implies that each basic variable is now nonnegative. Hence the basic solu-
tion after the call to PIvoT in line 8 is feasible. We next execute line 10, which
solves Lyx. Since we have assumed that L has a feasible solution, Lemma 29.11
implies that L,,, has an optimal solution with objective value 0. Since all the slack
forms are equivalent, the final basic solution to L,, must have X9 = 0, and after
removing Xp from the linear program, we obtain a slack form that is feasible for L.
Line 15 then returns this slack form. .

Fundamental theorem of linear programming

We conclude this chapter by showing that the SIMPLEX procedure works. In par-
ticular, any linear program either is infeasible, is unbounded, or has an optimal
solution with a finite objective value. In each case, SIMPLEX acts appropriately.
