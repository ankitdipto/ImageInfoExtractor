book. I. J. Good (1961) investigated the use of Bayesian inference in beliefnetworks.> The in-
fluence diagram or decision network representation for decision problems, which incorporated t
a DAG representation for random variables, was used in decision analysis in the late 1970s (see ij
Chapter 16), but no interesting evaluation algorithms were developed for decision networks until
1986 (Shachter, 1986). Judea Pearl (1982a) developed the message-passing method for carrying
out inference in networks that had the form of trees. Jin Kim (Kirn and Pearl, 1983) extended
the method to all singly connected networks. The backward-chaining algorithm given in the text
was derived by the authors, but has much in common with the methods of Pearl (1988) and of
Shachter et al. (1990). Gregory Cooper (1990) showed that the general problem of inference in
unconstrained belief networks is NP-hard, and Paul Dagum and Mike Luby (1993) showed the
corresponding approximation problem to be NP-hard.

David Spiegelhalter and Steffen Lauritzen pioneered the use of clustering for inference
in multiply connected networks (Spiegelhalter, 1986; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988). Finn
Jensen and colleagues (1990) developed an object-oriented computational scheme for clustering.
The scheme is implemented in the Hucin system, an efficient and widely used tool for uncertain
reasoning (Andersen ef al., 1989). Eric Horvitz, H. Jacques Suermondt, and Gregory Cooper
(1989) developed bounded cutset conditioning, building on earlier work on cutsets (Pearl, 1986).
The logic sampling method is due to Max Henrion (1988), and likelihood weighting was developed
by Fung and Chang (1989) and Shachter and Peot (1989). A large-scale application of likelihood
weighting to medical diagnosis appears in Shwe and Cooper (1991). The latter paper also
incorporates elements ofthe "Markov blanket" simulation scheme developed by Pearl (1987). The
first expert system using beliefnetworks was CONVINCE (Kim, 1983;Kim and Pearl, 1987). More
recent systems include the MUNIN system for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders (Andersen et
al., 1989) and the PATHFINDER system for pathology (Heckerman, 1991)

The extension of belief networks to handle continuous random variables is an important
topic of current research. The basic technical problem is that the distributions must be repre-
sentable by a finite number of parameters, and must come from a family of distributions that
is closed under beliefnet updating. To date, only Gaussian distributions have been used. Net-
works with continuous variables but no discrete variables have been considered (Pearl, 1988;
Shachter and Kenley, 1989). Such networks can be evaluated in polynomial time, regard-
less of topology. The inclusion of discrete variables has been investigated by Lauritzen and
Wermuth (1989), and implemented in the CHUGIN system (Olesen, 1993). Currently, exact
algorithms are known only for the case in which discrete variables are ancestors, not descendants,
of continuous variables. Stochastic simulation algorithms, on the other hand, can handle arbitrary

SUA distributions and topologies. . â€”

nepagLisnc Qualitative probabilistic networks (Wellman, 1990)provide a purely qualitative abstrac-
tion of belief networks, using the notion of positive and negative influences between variables.
Wellman shows that in many cases such information is sufficient for optimal decision making
without the need for precise specification of probability values. Work by Adnan Darwiche and
Matt Ginsberg (1992) extracts the basic properties of conditioning and evidence combination
from probability theory and shows that they can also be applied in logical and default reasoning

5 I J. Good was chief statistician for Turing's codebreaking team in World II. In 200]: 4 Space Odyssey, Axthur
C. Clarke credited Good and Minsky with making the breakthrough that led to the development of the HAL computer.
