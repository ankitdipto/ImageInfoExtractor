Chapter 29 Linear Programming

Theorem 29.13 (Fundamental theorem of linear programming)
Any linear program L, given in standard form, either

1. has an optimal solution with a finite objective value,
2. is infeasible, or

3. is unbounded.

If L is infeasible, SIMPLEX returns “infeasible.” If L is unbounded, SIMPLEX
returns “unbounded.” Otherwise, SIMPLEX returns an optimal solution with a finite
objective value.

Proof By Lemma 29.12, if linear program L is infeasible, then SIMPLEX returns
“infeasible.” Now suppose that the linear program L is feasible. By Lemma 29.12,
INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible.
By Lemma 29.7, therefore, SIMPLEX either returns “unbounded” or terminates
with a feasible solution. If it terminates with a finite solution, then Theorem 29.10
tells us that this solution is optimal. On the other hand, if SIMPLEX returns “un-
bounded,” Lemma 29.2 tells us the linear program L is indeed unbounded. Since
SIMPLEX always terminates in one of these ways, the proof is complete. .

Exercises

29.5-1
Give detailed pseudocode to implement lines 5 and 14 of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX.

29.5-2
Show that when the main loop of SIMPLEX is run by INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX, it can
never return “unbounded.”

29.5-3

Suppose that we are given a linear program L in standard form, and suppose that
for both L and the dual of L, the basic solutions associated with the initial slack
forms are feasible. Show that the optimal objective value of L is 0.

29.5-4
Suppose that we allow strict inequalities in a linear program. Show that in this
case, the fundamental theorem of linear programming does not hold.
