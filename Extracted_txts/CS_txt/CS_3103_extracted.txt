exchanged. Ifthe agent currently has A, then we could offer to trade C for A and some cash. The
agent prefers C, and so would be willing to give up some amount of cash to make this trade. We
could then offer to trade B for C, extracting more cash, and finally trade A for B. This brings us
back where we started from, except that the agent has less money. It seems reasonable to claim
that in this case the agent has not acted rationally.

The following six constraints are known as the axioms of utility theory. They specify the
most obvious semantic constraints on preferences and lotteries.

~ Orderability: Given any two states, a rational agent must either prefer one to the other or
else rate the two as equally preferable. That is, an agent should know what it wants.
(A> BV (BSA) V(A~5)
 Transitivity: Given any three states, if an agent prefers A to B and prefers B to C, then the
agent must prefer A to C.
(A>+BAB>O => (A+

0 Continuity: Ifsome state B is between A and C inpreference, then there is some probability
p for which the rational agent will be indifferent between getting B for sure and the lottery
that yields A with probability p and C with probability 1 — p.

A>B>C = Jp Ip,A; 1 —p,C] ~B

4 Substitutability: If an agent is indifferent between two lotteries, A and B, then the agent is
indifferent between two more complex lotteries that are the same except that B is substituted
for A in one of them. This holds regardless of the probabilities and the other outcome(s) in
the lotteries

A~B = {p,A, 1—p,C) ~[p,B:1- p,C]

< Monotonicity: Suppose there are two lotteries that have the same two outcomes, A and B.
Ifan agent prefers A to B, then the agent must prefer the lottery that has a higher probability
for A (and vice versa).

A>B = (p>aq@ [p.Av 1 —p.BlX [gs 1 — 4.8)

~ Decomposability: Compound lotteries can be reduced to simpler ones using the laws of
probability. This has been called the "no fun in gambling" rule because it says that an
agent should not prefer (or disprefer) one lottery just because it has more choice points
than another.

[p.4; 1 —p,[q,B: 1 —4 C)\ ~ [p.A; (1 —p)q. BB: (1 —p)1—q), C1

 

 

.. and then there was Utility

Notice that the axioms of utility theory do not say anything about utility. They only talk about
preferences. Preference is assumed to be a basic property of rational agents. The existence of a
utility function follows from the axioms of utility:

2 Itis still possible to account for an agent who enjoys gambling by reifying the act of gambling itself: just include in
the appropriate outcome states the proposition "participated in a gamble," and base utilities in part on that proposition.
