Utility Functions 477

 

The probability of the first head showing up on the nth toss is 1/2", so the expected monetary
value (EMV) of this game is
1 7 4 0
EMV(StP.) =)" P(Heads,)MV(Heads= $7 52 = —+— + = 4 084= x

Thus, an agent who is trying to maximize its expected monetary gain should be willing to pay
any finite sum for a chance to play this game. Somehow this does not seem rational to most
people. Bernoulli resolved the alleged paradox by positing that the utility of money is measured
on a logarithmic scale (at least for positive amounts):

 

U(Sisn)= logy n (for n > 0)
With this utility function, the expected utility of the game is 2:

EU(St.P.) = P(Heads;)U(Heads;= Jlogy2 = + +-4---=2

which means that a rational agent with the given utility scale should be willing to pay up to $4
for a chance to play the game, because U(Si+4)= log, 4 = 2.

Bemoulli chose log, as the utility function just to make this problem work out. However,
in a pioneering study of actual utility functions, Grayson ( 1 960) found an almost perfect fit to the
logarithmic form. One particular curve, for a certain Mr. Beard, is shown in Figure 16.1 (a). The
data obtained for Mr. Beard's preferences are consistent with a utility function

U(Stan)= -263.31 + 22.09 login + 150,000)
forthe range between n = —$150,000andn = $800,000.

We should not assume that this is the definitive utility function for monetary value, but
it is likely that most people have a utility function that is concave for positive wealth. Going
into debt is usually considered disastrous, but preferences between different levels of debt can
display a reversal ofthe concavity associated with positive wealth. For example, someone already
