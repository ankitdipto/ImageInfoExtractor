Section 16.4. Multiattribute utility functions 483

 

Preference structure and multiattribute utility

Suppose we have attributes, each of which has m distinct possible values. This gives a set of
possible outcomes of size m". In the worst case, the agent's utility function yields an arbitrary set
of preferences over these m” states with no regularities beyond those implied by the basic axioms
of utility. Multiattribute utility theory is based on the supposition that most utility functions have
much more structure than that, allowing us to use simplified decision procedures

Preferences without uncertainty

Let us begin by considering the case in which there is no uncertainty in the outcomes of actions,
and we are just considering preferences between concrete outcomes. In this case, the basic

Parr regularity in preference structure is called preference independence. Two attributes X\ and
Xz are preferentially independent of a third attribute X; if the preference between outcomes
(xy .x2,.x3) and (x4.x4,.x3) does not depend on the particular value x3 for attribute X3.

Going back to the airport example, where we have (among other attributes) Noise, Cost,
and Deaths to consider, one may propose that Noise and Cost are preferentially independent of
Deaths. For example, if we prefer a state with 20,000 people residing in the flight path and a
construction cost of $4 billion to a state with 70,000 people residing in the flightpath and a cost of
$3.7 billion when the safety level is 0.06 deaths per million passenger miles in both cases, then we
would have the same preference when the safety level is 0.13 or 0.01; and the same independence
would hold for preferences between any other pair of values for Noise and Cost. It is also
apparent that Cost and Deaths are preferentially independent ofNoise, and that Noise and Deaths
are preferentially independent of Cost. We say that the set of attributes {Noise,Cost, Deaths}

PEER exhibits mutual preferential independence (MPI). MPI says that whereas each attribute may
be important, it does not affect the way in which one trades off the other attributes against each
other.

Mutual preferential independence is something of a mouthful, but thanks to a remarkable

theorem due to the economist Debreu (1960), we can derive from it a very simple form for the

l be agent's value function: [fattributesX\, ..., X, are mutually preferentially independent, then the
agent's preference behavior can be described as maximizing the function

WS)= D> VAS)

where each V; is a valuefunction referring only to the attribute X;. For example, it might well be
the case that the airport decision can be made using a value function

V(S) - -Noise x 10*~- Cost - Deaths x 10'?

PORE vaLue A value function of this type is called an additive value function. Additive functions are an
extremely natural way to describe an agent's value function, and are valid in many real-world
situations. Even when MPI does not strictly hold, as might be the case at extreme values of
the attributes, an additive value function can still provide a good approximation to the agent's
preferences. This is especially true when the violations of MPI occur in portions of the attribute
ranges that are unlikely to occur in practice.
