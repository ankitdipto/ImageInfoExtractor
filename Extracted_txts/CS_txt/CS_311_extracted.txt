Chapter 29 Linear Programming

State for which values of r, s, and ¢ you can assert that
Both P and D have optimal solutions with finite objective values.
P is feasible, but D is infeasible.

D is feasible, but P is infeasible.

Re NS

Neither P nor D is feasible.

 

Problems

29-1 Linear-inequality feasibility

Given a set of m linear inequalities on n variables x;,X2,.... Xp, the linear-
inequality feasibility problem asks whether there is a setting of the variables that
simultaneously satisfies each of the inequalities.

a. Show that if we have an algorithm for linear programming, we can use it to
solve a linear-inequality feasibility problem. The number of variables and con-
straints that you use in the linear-programming problem should be polynomial
inn and m.

b. Show that if we have an algorithm for the linear-inequality feasibility problem,
we can use it to solve a linear-programming problem. The number of variables
and linear inequalities that you use in the linear-inequality feasibility problem
should be polynomial in 7 and m, the number of variables and constraints in
the linear program.

29-2 Complementary slackness

Complementary slackness describes a relationship between the values of primal
variables and dual constraints and between the values of dual variables and pri-
mal constraints. Let ¥ be a feasible solution to the primal linear program given
in (29.16)-(29.18), and let ¥ be a feasible solution to the dual linear program given
in (29.83)-(29.85). Complementary slackness states that the following conditions
are necessary and sufficient for ¥ and j to be optimal:
