The Value of Information 489

 

 

 

Now suppose that we are choosing between the two dirt roads in summertime, when
blockage by avalanches is unlikely. In this case, satellite reports might show one route to be more
scenic than the other because of flowering alpine meadows, or perhaps wetter because of errant
streams. It is therefore quite likely that we would change our plan if we had the information. But
in this case, the difference in value between the two routes is still likely to be very small, so we
will not bother to obtain the reports. This situation is shown in Figure 16.6(c).

In summary, we can say that information has value to the extent that it is likely to cause a
change of plan, and to the extent that the new plan will be significantly better than the old plan.

Figure 16.6 Three generic cases for the value of information. In (a), 4\ will almost certainly
remain superior to Az, so the information is not needed. In (b), the choice is unclear and the
information is crucial. In (c), the choice is unclear but because it makes little difference, the
information is less valuable.

 

 

 

Properties of the value of information

One might ask if it is possible for information to be deleteriousâ€”can it actually have negative
expected value? Intuitively, one should expect this to be impossible. After all, one could in the
worst case just ignore the information and pretend one has never received it. This is confirmed by
the following theorem, which applies to any decision-theoretic agent: The value ofinformation
is nonnegative:

ViE  VPIg(E)) > 0

proof as an exercise (Exercise 16.11). It is important to remember that VPI depends on the
current state ofinformation, which is why it is subscripted. It can change as more information is
acquired. In the extreme case, it will become zero ifthe variable in question already has a known
