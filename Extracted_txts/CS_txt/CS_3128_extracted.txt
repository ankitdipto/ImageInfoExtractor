if changes in technology mean that each aircraft generates half as much noise? What if noise
avoidance becomes three times more important?

168 Repeat Exercise 16.7, using the action-utility representation shown in Figure 16.5.

169 For either of the airport-siting diagrams constructed in Exercises 16,7 and 16.8, to which
conditional probability table entry is the utility most sensitive, given the available evidence?

16.10 (Adapted from Pearl (1988).) A used-car buyer can decide to carry out various tests with
various costs (e.g., kick the tires, take the car to a qualified mechanic), and then, depending on
the outcome of the tests, decide which car to buy. We will assume that the buyer is deciding
whether to buy car c;, that there is time to carry out at most one test, and that r; is the test of ¢,
and costs $50.

A car can be in good shape (quality g*) or bad shape (quality g~), and the tests may help
to indicate what shape the car is in. Car c\ costs $1,500, and its market value is $2,000 ifit is in
good shape; ifnot, $700 in repairs will be needed to make it in good shape. The buyer's estimate
is that c| has a 70% chance of being in good shape.

a. Calculate the expected net gain from buying ¢;, given no test.
b. Tests can be described by the probability that the car will pass or fail given that the car is
in good or bad shape. We have the following information:

P(pass(c1,1)|g*(e1)) = 0.8

P(pass(c,t1)|q~ (e1)) = 0.35

Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability that the car will pass (or fail) its test, and

hence the probability that it is in good (or bad) shape given each possible test outcome.

c. Calculate the optimal decisions given either a pass or a fail, and their expected utilities.
d. Calculate the value of information of the test, and derive an optimal conditional plan for
the buyer.

 

16.11 Prove that the value of information is nonnegative, as stated in Section 166.
