Chapter 2. Intelligent Agents

 

2.7 Implement an environment fora n x m rectangularroom, where each square has a 5% chance
ofcontaining dirt, and n and m are chosen at random from the range 8 to 15, inclusive.

28 Design and implement a pure reflex agent for the environment of Exercise 2.7, ignoring
the requirement of returning home, and measure its performance. Explain why it is impossible
to have a reflex agent that returns home'and shuts itselfoff. Speculate on what the best possible
teflex agent could do. What prevents a reflex agent from doing very well?

29 Design and implement several agents with internal state. Measure their performance. How
close do they come to the ideal agent for this environment?

210 Calculate the size of the table for a table-lookup agent in the domain of Exercise 2.7.
Explain your calculation. You need not fill in the entries for the table.

211 Experiment with changing the shape and dirt placement of the room, and with adding
furniture. Measure your agents in these new environments. Discuss how their performance
might be improved to handle more complex geographies.
