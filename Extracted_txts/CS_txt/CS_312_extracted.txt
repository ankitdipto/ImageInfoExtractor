its corresponding dual.

(29.16)—(29.18) is optimal if and only if there exist values ¥ = (V1. Jo..--. Ym)
such that

1. y isa feasible solution to the dual linear program given in (29.83)-(29.85),
2. Vy, aij Yi = C; for all j such that x; > 0, and

29-3 Integer linear programming

An integer linear-programming problem is a linear-programming problem with
the additional constraint that the variables x must take on integral values. Exer-
cise 34.5-3 shows that just determining whether an integer linear program has a
feasible solution is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time
algorithm for this problem.

a. Show that weak duality (Lemma 29.8) holds for an integer linear program.

b. Show that duality (Theorem 29.10) does not always hold for an integer linear
program.

c. Given a primal linear program in standard form, let us define P to be the opti-
mal objective value for the primal linear program, D to be the optimal objective
value for its dual, /P to be the optimal objective value for the integer version of
the primal (that is, the primal with the added constraint that the variables take
on integer values), and JD to be the optimal objective value for the integer ver-
sion of the dual. Assuming that both the primal integer program and the dual
integer program are feasible and bounded, show that

iP<P=D<ID.
