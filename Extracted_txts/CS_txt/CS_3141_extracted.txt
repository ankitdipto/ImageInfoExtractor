 

Part II

PROBLEM-SOLVING

 

 

 

In this part we show how an agent can act by establishing goa/s and considering
sequences of actions that might achieve those goals. A goal and a set of means
for achieving the goal is called aproblem, and the process of exploring what the
means can do is called search. We show what search can do, how it must be
modified to account for adversaries, and what its limitations are.
