is solvable, where x is an n-vector and y is an m-vector. Prove Farkas’s lemma.

29-5 Minimum-cost circulation

In this problem, we consider a variant of the minimum-cost-flow problem from
Section 29.2 in which we are not given a demand, a source, or a sink. Instead,
we are given, as before, a flow network and edge costs a(u,v). A flow is feasible
if it satisfies the capacity constraint on every edge and flow conservation at every
vertex. The goal is to find, among all feasible flows, the one of minimum cost. We
call this problem the minimum-cost-circulation problem.

a. Formulate the minimum-cost-circulation problem as a linear program.

b. Suppose that for all edges (u,v) € E, we have a(u,v) > 0. Characterize an
optimal solution to the minimum-cost-circulation problem.

c. Formulate the maximum-flow problem as a minimum-cost-circulation problem
linear program. That is given a maximum-flow problem instance G = (V, E)
with source s, sink f and edge capacities c, create a minimum-cost-circulation
problem by giving a (possibly different) network G’ = (V’, E’) with edge
capacities c’ and edge costs a’ such that you can discern a solution to the
maximum-flow problem from a solution to the minimum-cost-circulation prob-
lem.

d. Formulate the single-source shortest-path problem as a minimum-cost-circu-
lation problem linear program.

 

Chapter notes

This chapter only begins to study the wide field of linear programming. A num-
ber of books are devoted exclusively to linear programming, including those by
Chvatal [69], Gass [130], Karloff [197], Schrijver [303], and Vanderbei [344].
Many other books give a good coverage of linear programming, including those
by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [271] and Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7]. The
coverage in this chapter draws on the approach taken by Chvatal.
