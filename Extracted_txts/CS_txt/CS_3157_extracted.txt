Figure 17.17 Some proposed networks for Ping-Pong tracking.

 

d. The nodes in the networks shown in the figure refer to past and present times. Explain how
the networks can be extended and used to predict the position at any future time.

e. Now consider the vision subsystem, whose job it is to provide observation evidence. Its
input is an array of intensity values from the camera image. Assuming that the ball is
white, whereas most of the room is darker, explain briefly how to calculate the position of
the ball given the array.

Does it make more sense to calculate the position in coordinates relative to the robot or
relative to the room? Why?
