LEARNING

 

 

So far we have assumed that all the "intelligence" in an agent has been built in by
the agent's designer. The agent is then let loose in an environment, and does the
best it can given the way it was programmed to act. But this is not necessarily
the best approach—for the agent or the designer. Whenever the designer has
incomplete knowledge of the environment that the agent will live in, learning is
the only way that the agent can acquire what it needs to know. Learning thus
provides autonomy in the sense defined in Chapter 1. It also provides a good
way to build high-performance systems—by giving a learning system experience
in the application domain.

The four chapters in this part cover the field of machine learning—the
subfield of AI concerned with programs that leam from experience. Chapter 18
introduces the basic design for learning agents, and addresses the general problem
of learning from examples. Chapter 19 discusses the process oflearning in neural
networks—collections of simple nonlinear processing elements—and in belief
networks. In Chapter 20, we tackle the general problem ofimproving the behavior
ofan agent given some feedback as to its performance. Finally, Chapter 21 shows
how learning can be improved by using prior knowledge.
