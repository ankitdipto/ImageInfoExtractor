Polynomials and the FFT

The straightforward method of adding two polynomials of degree n takes O(n)
time, but the straightforward method of multiplying them takes @(n7) time. In this
chapter, we shall show how the fast Fourier transform, or FFT, can reduce the time
to multiply polynomials to O(n Ign).

The most common use for Fourier transforms, and hence the FFT, is in signal
processing. A signal is given in the time domain: as a function mapping time to
amplitude. Fourier analysis allows us to express the signal as a weighted sum of
phase-shifted sinusoids of varying frequencies. The weights and phases associated
with the frequencies characterize the signal in the frequency domain. Among the
many everyday applications of FFT’s are compression techniques used to encode
digital video and audio information, including MP3 files. Several fine books delve
into the rich area of signal processing; the chapter notes reference a few of them.

Polynomials

A polynomial in the variable x over an algebraic field F represents a function A(x)
as a formal sum:

n-l
A(x) = Yoajx! .
j=0

We call the values dp,d),..., a, the coefficients of the polynomial. The co-
efficients are drawn from a field F,, typically the set C of complex numbers. A
polynomial A(x) has degree k if its highest nonzero coefficient is az; we write
that degree(A) = k. Any integer strictly greater than the degree of a polynomial
is a degree-bound of that polynomial. Therefore, the degree of a polynomial of
degree-bound 7 may be any integer between 0 and n — 1, inclusive.

We can define a variety of operations on polynomials. For polynomial addi-
tion, if A(x) and B(x) are polynomials of degree-bound 1, their sum is a polyno-
