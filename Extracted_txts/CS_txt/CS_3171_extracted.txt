Figure 186 Splitting the examples by testing on attributes. In (a), we see that Patrons is a
good attribute to test first; in (b), we see that Type is a poor one; and in (c), we see that Hungry is
a fairly good second test, given that Patrons is the first test.

 

 

 

the examples withoutthem. It has also detected an interesting regularity in the data (namely, that
the first author will wait for Thai food on weekends) that was not even suspected. Many hours
have been wasted by machine learning researchers trying to debug their learning algorithms when
in fact the algorithm was behaving properly all along.

Ofcourse, ifwe were to gather more examples, we might induce a tree more similar to the
original. The tree in Figure 18.8 is bound to make a mistake; for example, it has never seen a
case where the wait is 0-10 minutes but the restaurant is full. For a case where Hungry is false,
the tree says not to wait, but the author would certainly wait. This raises an obvious question: if
the algorithm induces a consistent but incorrect tree from the examples, how incorrect will the
tree be? The next section shows how to analyze this experimentally.
