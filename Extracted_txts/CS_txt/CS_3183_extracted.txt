We can now specify the CURRENT-BEST-LEARNING algorithm, shown in Figure 18.11.No-
tice that each time we consider generalizing or specializing the hypothesis, we must check for con-
sistency with the other examples, because there is no guarantee that an arbitrary increase/decrease
in the extension will avoid including/excluding any other negative/positive examples.

H— any hypothesis consistent with the first example in examples
for each remaining example in examples do
if ¢ is false positive for H then
H— choose a specialization of H consistent with examples
alse ife is false negative for H then
H — choose a generalization of H consistent with examples
if no consistent specialization/generalization can be found then fail

hypothesis and backtracks when no consistent specialization/ generalization can be found.

 

 

 

We have defined generalization and specialization as operations that change the extension
of a hypothesis. Now we need to determine exactly how they can be implemented as syntactic
operations that change the candidate definition associated with the hypothesis, so that a program
can carry them out. This is done by first noting that generalization and specialization are also
logical relationships between hypotheses. Ifhypothesis H,, with definition C), is a generalization
of hypothesis Hz with definition C>, then we must have

Vx Cox) > Ci(x)

Therefore in order to construct a generalization of H2, we simply need to find a definition C\
that is logically implied by C2. This is easily done. For example, if C2(x) is Alternate(x) A
