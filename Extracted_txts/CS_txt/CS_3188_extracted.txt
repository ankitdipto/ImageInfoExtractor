We continue these operations for each new instance until one of three things happens:

1. We have exactly one concept left in the version space, in which case we return it as the
unique hypothesis.

2. The version space collapses—either S or G becomes empty, indicating that there are no

consistent hypotheses for the training set. This is the same case as the failure of the simple
version of the decision tree algorithm.
