66 Chapter 3. Solving Problems by Searching

 

First, let us review the single-state case with complete information. We assume that the
agent knows its location and the locations of all the pieces of dirt, and that the suction is still in
good working order.

~ States: one of the eight states shown in Figure 3.2 (or Figure 3.6).
Operators: move left, move right, suck.

© Goal test: no dirt left in any square.

> Path cost: each action costs 1,

R= move right, $= suck.

 

 

 

Figure 3.6 shows the complete state space showing all the possible paths. Solving the
problem from any starting state is simply a matter of following arrows to a goal state. This is the
case for all problems, of course, but in most, the state space is vastly larger and more tangled.

Now let us consider the case where the agent has no sensors, but still has to clean up all
the dirt. Because this is a multiple-state problem, we will have the following:

0 State sets: subsets of states 1-8 shown in Figure 3.2 (or Figure 3.6).

Operators: move left, move right, suck.

0 Goal test: all states in state set have no dirt

© Path cost: each action costs 1.
The start state set is the set of all states, because the agent has no sensors. A solution is any
sequence leading from the start state set to a set of states with no dirt (see Figure 3.7). Similar

state set spaces can be constructed for the case of uncertainty about actions and uncertainty about
both states and actions.
