form a group under multiplication (see Section 31.3). This group has the same
structure as the additive group (Zn, +) modulo n, since w” = w? = 1 implies that
ojok = oft = w+" In| Similarly, @,! = w?-!. The following lemmas
furnish some essential properties of the complex nth roots of unity.

 

Lemma 30.3 (Cancellation lemma)
For any integers n > 0,k > 0, and d > 0,

ofk = 0k. (30.7)

Proof The lemma follows directly from equation (30.6), since

2Many other authors define wn differently: mn = e72!/", This alternative definition tends to be
used for signal-processing applications. The underlying mathematics is substantially the same with
either definition of on.
