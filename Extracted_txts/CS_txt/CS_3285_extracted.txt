Figure 3.7 State set space for the simplified vacuum world with no sensors. Each dashed-line
box encloses a set of states. At any given point, the agent is within a state set but does not know
which state of that set it is in. The initial state set (complete ignorance) is the top center box.
Actions are represented by labelled arcs. Self-loops are omitted for clarity.

 

 

Missionaries and cannibals

The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. Three missionaries and
three cannibals are on one side ofa river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find
a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place
outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.

This problem is famous in AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached
problem formulation from an analytical viewpoint (Amarel, 1968). As with travelling in Romania,
the real-life problem must be greatly abstracted before we can apply a problem-solving strategy.
