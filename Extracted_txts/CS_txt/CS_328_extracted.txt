Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT

Corollary 30.4
For any even integer n > 0,

on? =o, =-1.
Proof The proof is left as Exercise 30.2-1. .

Lemma 30.5 (Halving lemma)

If n > O is even, then the squares of the n complex nth roots of unity are the n/2
complex (n/2)th roots of unity.

Proof By the cancellation lemma, we have (w*)? = ok, for any nonnegative
integer k. Note that if we square all of the complex mth roots of unity, then we
obtain each (n/2)th root of unity exactly twice, since

(wk nl)? = opktn

= wx

= oor

= wk

= wo

= (ok),
Thus, o* and w**”/? have the same square. We could also have used Corol-
lary 30.4 to prove this property, since w?/? = —1 implies o**"/? = —o*, and
thus (wk+"/?)? = (wk)? 7

As we shall see, the halving lemma is essential to our divide-and-conquer ap-
proach for converting between coefficient and point-value representations of poly-
nomials, since it guarantees that the recursive subproblems are only half as large.

Lemma 30.6 (Summation lemma)
For any integer n > 1 and nonzero integer k not divisible by n,

n-1 .
Vi lon)' =0.
j=0

Proof Equation (A.5) applies to complex values as well as to reals, and so we
have
