Chapter 21. Knowledge in Learning

 

21.5 Suppose one writes a logic program that carries out a resolution inference step. That is,
let Resolve(c), c2,c) succeed if c is the result of resolving c| and Â¢,. Normally, Resolve would
be used as part ofa theorem prover by calling it with c\ and c; instantiated to particular clauses,
thereby generating the resolvent c. Now suppose instead that we call it with c instantiated and
c\ and c2 uninstantiated. Will this succeed in generating the appropriate results of an inverse
resolution step? Would you need any special modifications to the logic programming system for
this to work?

21.6 Suppose that FOIL is considering adding a literal to a clause using a binary predicate P,
and that previous literals (including the head of the clause) contain five different variables.

a. How many functionally different literals can be generated? Notice that two literals are
functionally identical if they differ only in the names of the new variables that they contain.

b. Can you find a general formula for the number of different literals with a predicate of arity
r when there are 7 variables previously used?

c. Why does FOIL not allow literals that contain no previously used variables?

21.7 Using the data from the family tree in Figure 21.5, or a subset thereof, apply the FOIL
algorithm to leam a definition for the Ancestor predicate.
