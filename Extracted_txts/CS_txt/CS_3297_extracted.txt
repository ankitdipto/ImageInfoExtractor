 

Part VII

COMMUNICATING, PERCEIVING,
AND ACTING

 

 

 

So far we have been concerned with what happens inside an agent—from the
time it receives a percept to the time it decides on an action. In this part, we
concentrate on the interface between the agent and the environment. On one end,
we have perception: vision, hearing, touch, and possibly other senses. On the
other end, we have action: the movement of a robot arm, for example.

Also covered in this part is communication. A group of agents can be more
successful—individually and collectively—ifthey communicate their beliefs and
goals to each other. We look most closely at human language and how it can be
used as a communication tool.
