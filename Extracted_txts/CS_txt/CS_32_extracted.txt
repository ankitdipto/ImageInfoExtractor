24.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths 667

 

Figure 24.8 The constraint graph corresponding to the system (24.3)-(24.10) of difference con-
straints. The value of 5(vo,v;) appears in each vertex v;. One feasible solution to the system is
x = (-5,-3,0,-1,—-4).

The constraint graph contains the additional vertex vp, as we shall see shortly, to
guarantee that the graph has some vertex which can reach all other vertices. Thus,
the vertex set V consists of a vertex v; for each unknown x;, plus an additional
vertex Vo. The edge set E contains an edge for each difference constraint, plus
an edge (vo, ¥;) for each unknown x;. If xj — x; < by is a difference constraint,
then the weight of edge (v;, v;) is w(v;, vj) = bg. The weight of each edge leav-
ing Vo is 0. Figure 24.8 shows the constraint graph for the system (24.3)-(24.10)
of difference constraints.

The following theorem shows that we can find a solution to a system of differ-
ence constraints by finding shortest-path weights in the corresponding constraint
graph.

Theorem 24.9
Given a system Ax < b of difference constraints, let G = (V, E) be the corre-
sponding constraint graph. If G contains no negative-weight cycles, then

X = (8(Vo, V1), (Vo, V2), 5(vo, V3), -+ + 5(Vo, Yn) (24.11)

is a feasible solution for the system. If G contains a negative-weight cycle, then
there is no feasible solution for the system.

Proof We first show that if the constraint graph contains no negative-weight
cycles, then equation (24.11) gives a feasible solution. Consider any edge
(v;,v;) € E. By the triangle inequality, 5(vo,vj) < 5(vo.v)) + w(v;.v;) or,
equivalently, 5(vo, vj) — 5(vo. vi) < w(v;. vj). Thus, letting xj = 5(vo, v;) and
