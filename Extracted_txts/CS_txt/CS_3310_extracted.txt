An agent that communicates

We will now look at an example of communication, in the form of a wumpus world agent that
acts as a robot slave that can be commanded by a master. On each turn, the slave describes its
percepts in English (actually in a restricted subset), waits for a command from the master, and
then interprets the command and executes it. Here is a fragment ofa typical dialogue:

ROBOT SLAVE MASTER
I feel a breeze. Go to 1 2
Nothing is here. Go north.
I feel a breeze and I smell a stench

and I see a glitter. Grab it.

The agent program is shown in Figure 22.4. The rest of this chapter fills in the missing routines
in the agent program. First, Section 22.3 defines the subset of English in which the agents
communicate. Then, Section 22.4 shows how to implement the PARSE function to syntactically
analyze strings of the language. Section 22.7 shows how to recover the meaning of a string
(the function SEMANTICS), and Section 22.8 shows what to do when there are several possible
meanings (the function DISAMBIGUATE). The function GENERATE-DESCRIPTION is not covered in
depth, but in general much the same knowledge that is used for understanding can also be used
for producing language.

A FORMAL GRAMMAR FOR A SUBSET OF ENGLISH

In this section, we define a formal grammar for a small subset of English that is suitable for
making statements about the wumpus world. We will call this language &. In defining the
language this way, we are implicitly claiming that formal language techniques are appropriate for
dealing with natural language. In many ways, they are appropriate: natural languages make use
