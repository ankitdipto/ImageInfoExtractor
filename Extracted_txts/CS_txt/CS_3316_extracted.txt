Chapter 22. Agents that Communicate

 

¢ A variable can appear on the right-hand side of a DCG rule. The variable represents a
single symbol in the input string, without saying what it is. We can use this to define the
nonterminal category Double as the set of strings consisting ofa word repeated twice. Here
is the definition in both DCG notation and normal first-order logic notation:

DCG . First-Order Logic
Double — ww (5, ={[w]A 52 =[w]) = Double(Append(s,,s2))

+ An arbitrary logical test can appear on the right-hand side ofa rule. Such tests are enclosed

in curly braces in DCG notation.

As an example using all three extensions, here are rules for Digit and Number in the grammar

of arithmetic (see Appendix B). The nonterminals take an extra argument representing their
semantic interpretation:

DCG First-Order Logic

Digit(sem) — sem {0< sem < 9} (s = [sem\) = Digit(sem,s)

Number(sem) — Digit(sem) Digit(sem,s) => Number(sem,s)

Number(sem) — Number(sem) Digit(semy) Number(sem, s;) A Digit(sem, >)
{sem =10 x sem, + sem} Asem= 10x sem\ +sem) >

 

Number(sem, Append(s1,.s))

The first rule can be read as "a phrase of category Digit and semantic value sem can be formed
from a symbol sem between 0 and 9." The second rule says that a number can consist ofa single
digit, and has the same semantics as that digit. The third can be read as saying "a number with
semantic value sem can be formed from a number with semantic value sem\ followed by a digit
with semantic value sem, where sem = 10 x sem +sem.”

There are now five things that can appear on the right-hand side of a rule in DCG nota-
tion: an un-augmented nonterminal (Digit), an augmented nonterminal (Digit(sem)),a variable
representing a terminal (sem), a constant terminal (word), or a logical test ({0 < sem < 9}). The
left-hand side must consist of a single nonterminal, with or without augmentation.

22.6 _AUGMENTING A GRAMMAR

(OVERGENERATES

CASES

‘AGREEMENT

The simple grammar for €) generates many sentences of English, but it also overgenerates—
generates sentences that are not grammatical—such as "Me smells a stench" There are two
problems with this string: it should be "L" not "me," and it should be "smell," not "smells." To
fix these problems, we will first determine what the facts of English are, and then see how we
can get the grammar to reflect the facts.

Many languages divide their nouns into different cases, depending on their role in the
sentence. Those who have taken Latin are familiar with this, but in English there is no notion
of case on regular nouns, only on pronouns. We say that pronouns like "I" are in the subjective
(or nominative) case, and pronouns like "me" are in the objective (or accusative) case. Many
languages have a dative case for words in the indirect object position. Many languages also
require agreement between the subject and main verb ofa sentence. Here, too, the distinctions
