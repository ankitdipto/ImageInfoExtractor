and "give to 1,2." To eliminate these, the grammar must state which verbs can be followed by
which other categories. We call this the subcategorization information for the verb. Each verb
has a list of complements—obligatory phrases that follow the verb within the verb phrase. So in
"Give the gold to me," the NP "the gold" and the PP "to me" are complements of “give.”®

A subcategorization list is a list of complement categories that the verb accepts, so "give"
has the subcategorization list /NP, PP] in this example. It is possible for a verb to have more
than one subcategorization list, just as it is possible for a word to have more than one category,
or for a pronoun to have more than one case.” In fact, "give" also has the subcategorization list
LNP.NP], as in "Give me the gold." We can treat this like any other kind of ambiguity. It is also
important to know what subcategorization lists a verb does not take. The fact that "give" does
not take the list /PP] means that "give to me" is not by itself a valid verb phrase. Figure 22.11
gives some examples of verbs and their subcategorization lists, or subcats for short.

& This is one definition of complement, but other authors have different terminology. Some say that the subject of the
verbis also a complement. Others say that only the prepositional phrase is a complement, and the noun phrase should be
called an argument.

7 For example, "you" can be used in either subjective or objective case
