The semantics of £,

We had no problem with "John loves Mary,” but things get more complicated when we consider all
off. Immediately we are faced with all the choices of Chapter 8 for our semantic representation;
for example, how do we represent time, events, and substances? Our first choice will be to use
the event calculus notation of Section 8.4. In this notation, the sentence "Every agent smells a
wumpus” can be expressed as:

Va Agent(a) > Jw Wumpus(w)d Je e & Perceive(a, w, Nose) A During(Now, e)

We could have used a Smell predicate instead of Perceive, but we wanted to be able to emphasize
the similarities between smelling, hearing, feeling, touching, and seeing.

Our task is to build up our desired representation from the constituents of the sentence. We
first break the sentence into NP and VP phrases, to which we can assign the following semantics:

Every agent NP(W a Agent(a) > ...)

smells a wampus VP(3 w Wumpus(w)A

de (e e Perceive(... , w, Nose) \ During(Now,e))

Right away there are two problems. First, the semantics of the entire sentence appears to be the

semantics of the NP with the semantics ofthe VP filling in the ... part. That means that we cannot
form the semantics of the sentence with rel(obj). We could do it with obj(rel),which seems a
