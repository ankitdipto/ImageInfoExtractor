Figure 22.17 Table showing the type of quasi-logical form expression for each syntactic
category. The notation t — = r denotes a function that takes an argument of type f and retums a
result of type 7:

 

 

 

We did not specify which of the two quantified terms gets pulled out first, so there are actually
two possible interpretations:

Vd Dog(d) = Ja Day(a) A 3e e€ Has(d,a, Now)
Sa Day(a)\Vd Dog(d) => Je e€ Has(d,a,Now)

The first one says that each dog has his own day, while the second says there is a special day that
all dogs share. Choosing between them is a job for disambiguation. Often the left-to-right order
of the quantified terms matches the left-to-right order of the quantifiers, but other factors come
into play. The advantage of quasi-logical form is that it succinctly represents all the possibilities.
The disadvantage is that it doesn't help you choose between them; for that we need the full power
of disambiguation using all sources of evidence.

   
 

Pragmatic Interpretation

We have shown how an agent can perceive a string of words and use a grammar to derive a set of
possible semantic interpretations. Now we address the problem of completing the interpretation
by adding information about the current situation, information that is noncompositional and
context-dependent.
