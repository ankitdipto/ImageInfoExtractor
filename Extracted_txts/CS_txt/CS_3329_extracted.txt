It is helpfull to think of the search process as building up a search tree that is superimposed
over the state space. The root of the search tree is a search node corresponding to the initial
state. The leaf nodes of the tree correspond to states that do not have successors in the tree,
either because they have not been expanded yet, or because they were expanded, but generated.
the empty set. At each step, the search algorithm chooses one leaf node to expand. Figure 3.8
shows some of the expansions in the search tree for route finding from Arad to Bucharest. The
general search algorithm is described informally in Figure 3.9.

It is important to distinguish between the state space and the search tree. For the route-
finding problem, there are only 20 states in the state space, one for each city. But there are an
