time, there are no strict rules on on anaphoric reference. So deciding which reference is the right
one is a part of disambiguation, although the disambiguation is certainly guided by pragmatic
(ie., context-dependent) information.

speech act that may have several interpretations, but which in the current situation can best be
interpreted as communicating P. The hearer realizes this, and so arrives at P as the interpretation.
We say that the hearer has disambiguated or resolved the ambiguity. Occasionally, the hearer
may be confused and need to ask for clarification, but it would be tiresome if this happened too
often, or if the hearer asked for clarification on the clarification. Unfortunately, there are many
ways in which communication can break down. A speaker who does not speak loudly enough
