+ There are many algorithms for parsing strings. We showed a simple one. It is also possible
to feed DCG rules directly to a logic programming system or theorem prover.

* Pragmatic interpretation takes the current situation into account to determine the effect of
an utterance in context.

* Disambiguation is the process of deciding which of the possible interpretations is the one
that the speaker intended to convey.

 

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES

The idea of language as action stems from twentieth-century linguistically oriented philosophy
(Wittgenstein, 1953; Grice, 1957; Austin, 1962) and particularly from the book Speech Acts
(Searle, 1969). A precursor to the idea of speech acts was Protagoras's distinction of four types
of sentence: prayer, question, answer, and injunction. Hobbs ef al. (1987) describe a more
practical application of the situated model.

Like semantic networks, context-free grammars (also known as phrase structure grammars)
are a reinvention of a technique first used by the ancient Indian grammarians (especially Panini,
c. 350 B.C.) studying Shastric Sanskrit (Ingerman, 1967). In modern times, they were reinvented
by Noam Chomsky for the analysis of English syntax (Chomsky, 1956) and independently by
John Backus forthe analysis of Algol-60 syntax. Naur (Naur, 1963) extended Backus's notation,
and is now credited with the “N” in BNF, which originally stood for "Backus Normal Form."

aE Knuth (1968) defined a kind of augmented grammar called attribute grammar.

There have been many attempts to write formal grammars of natural languages, both in
"pure" linguistics and in computational linguistics. The Linguistic String Project at New York
University (Sager, 1981) produced a large grammar for the machine parsing of English, using
essentially context-free rewrite rules with some restrictions based on subcategorization. A good
example ofa modern system using unification grammar is the Core Language Engine (Alshawi,
1992). There are several comprehensive but informal grammars of English (Quirk et al., 1985;
Huddleston, 1988). Good textbooks on linguistics include Baker (1989) and Chierchia and
McConnell-Ginet (1990). McCawley's (1993) text concentrates on logic for linguists. Definite
clause grammars were introduced by Colmerauer (1975) and developed and popularized by
Pereira and Warren (1980).

Formal semantic interpretation of natural languages originates within philosophy and for-
mal logic and is especially closely related to Alfred Tarski's (1935) work on the semantics of
formal languages. Bar-Hillel was the first to consider the problems of pragmatics and propose
that they could be handled by formal logic. For example, he introduced C.S. Peirce's (1902) term
indexical into linguistics (Bar-Hillel, 1954). Richard Montague's essay "English as a formal lan-
guage" (1970) is a kind of manifesto for the logical analysis of language, but the book by Dowty,
‘Wall, and Peters (1991) and the article by Lewis (1972) are more readable. A complete collection
of Montague's contributions has been edited by Thomason (1974). In artificial intelligence, the
work of McAllester and Givan (1992) continues the Montagovian tradition, adding many new
technical insights.
