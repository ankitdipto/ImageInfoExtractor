Write down at least one other English sentence generated by Grammar (B). It should be signifi-
cantly different from the above sentence, and should be at least six words long. Do not use any of
the words from the preceding sentence; instead, add grammatical rules of your own, for instance,
Noun — bottle. Show the parse tree for your sentence.

228 This exercise concerns a language we call Buffalo" which is very much like English except
the only word in its lexicon is buffalo. (The language is due to Barton, Berwick, and Ristad.)
Here are two sentences from the language:

+ Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

+ Buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.
In case you don't believe these are sentences, here are two English sentences with corresponding
syntactic structure:

* Dallas cattle bewilder Denver cattle.

* Chefs London critics admire cook French food.
Write a grammar for Buffalo". The lexical categories are adjective, noun, and (transitive) verb,
and there should be one grammar rule for sentence, one for verb phrase, and three rules for noun
phrase: raw noun, adjective modifier, and reduced relative clause (ie., a relative clause without
the word "that"). Tabulate the number of possible parses for Buffalo'for n up to 10.
