LANGUAGE PROCESSING

 

 

 

In which we see how to scale upfrom toy domains like the wumpus world to practical
systems that perform useful tasks with language.

In Chapter 22, we saw that agents can gain by communicating with each other. We also saw some
techniques for interpreting sentences from simple subsets of English. In this chapter, we show
how far beyond the wumpus world one can go by elaborating on those techniques. The topics
covered are as follows:

0 Practical applications: tasks where natural language has proved useful

~ Discourse processing: the problem of handling more than one sentence.

0 Efficient parsing: algorithms for parsing and interpreting sentences quickly.

0 Scaling up the lexicon: dealing with unusual and even unknown words

Scaling up the grammar: dealing with complicated syntax.

< Semantic interpretation: some problems that make semantic interpretation more than

just a matter of composing simple functions
0 Disambiguation: how to choose the right interpretation.

23.1 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

We start by surveying successful systems that put natural language to practical use. The successful
systems share two properties: they are focused on a particular domain rather than allowing
discussion of any topic, and they are focused on a particular task rather than attempting to
understand language completely. We will look at five tasks.

Machine translation

In the early 1960s, there was great hope that computers would be able to translate from one
natural language to another, just as Turing's project "translated" coded messages into intelligible
