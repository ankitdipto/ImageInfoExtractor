Chapter 23 Practical Natural Language Processing

 

the categories. In the last few years, NLP systems have proven to be just as accurate, correctly
categorizing over 90% of the news stories. They are also far faster and more consistent, so there
has been a switch from humans to automated systems.

Text categorization is amenable to NLP techniques where IR is not because the categories
are fixed, and thus the system builders can spend the time tuning their program to the problem.
For example, in a dictionary, the primary definition of the word "crude" is vulgar, but in a large
sample of the Wall Street Journal, "crude" refers to oil 100% of the time.

Extracting data from text

The task of data extraction is to take on-line text and derive from it some assertions that can be
put into a structured database. For example, the SCISOR system (Jacobs and Rau, 1990)is able to
take the following Dow Jones News Service story:

PILLSBURY SURGED 3 3-4 TO 62 IN BIG BOARD COMPOSITE TRADING OF 3.1 MIL-
LION SHARES AFTER BRITAIN'S GRAND METROPOLITAN RAISED ITS HOSTILE
TENDER OFFER BY $3 A SHARE TO $63, THE COMPANY PROMPTLY REJECTED
THE SWEETENED BID, WHICH CAME AFTER THE TWO SIDES COULDN'T AGREE
TO A HIGHER OFFER ON FRIENDLY TERMS OVER THE WEEKEND.

and generate this template to add to a database:

Corp-Takeover-Core:
Subevent: Increased Offer, Rejected Offer
Type: Hostile
Target: Pillsbury
Suitor: Grand Metropolitan
Share-Price: 63
Stock-Exchange: NYSE
Volume: 3.1M
Effect-On-Stock: (Up Increment: 3 3-4, To: 62)

23.2__ EFFICIENT PARSING

Consider the following two sentences:

Have the students in section 2 of Computer Science 101 take the exam.
Have the students in section 2 of Computer Science 101 taken the exam?

Even though they share the first ten words, these sentences have very different parses, because
the first is acommand and the second is a question. A left-to-right parsing algorithm like the one
in Section 22.4 that nondeterministically tries to build the right structure would have to guess if
the first word is part ofa command or a question, and will not be able to tell if the guess is correct
until at least the eleventh word, "take/taken." Ifthe algorithm guessed wrong, it will have to
