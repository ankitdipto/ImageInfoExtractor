The ride the horse gave was wild

 

 

Figure 23.5 A left-comer parsing algorithm avoids predicting a VP starting with "ride," but
does predict a VP starting with "was," because the grammar expects a VP following an NP.
The triangle over "the horse gave" means that the words have a parse as a RefClause, but with

 

 

additional intermediate constituents that are not shown.

 

Extracting parses from the chart: Packing

When the chart-parsing algorithm finishes, it returns the entire chart, but what we really want is a
parse tree (or trees). Depending on how the parser is used, we may want to pick out one or all the
parse trees that span the entire input, or we may want to look at some subtrees that do not span
the whole input. If we have an augmented grammar, we may only want to look at the semantic
augmentation, ignoring the syntactic structure. In any case, we need to be able to extract parses
from the chart

The easiest way to do that is to modify COMPLETER so that when it combines two child
edges to produce a parent edge, it stores in the parent edge the list of children that comprise it.
Then, when we are done with the parse, we need only look in chart[n] for an edge that starts
at 0, and recursively look at the children lists to reproduce a complete parse tree. The only
complication is deciding what to do about ambiguous parses. To see why this is a problem, let
us look at an example. The sentence

Fall leaves fall and spring leaves spring

is highly ambiguous because each word (except "and") can be either a noun or a verb, and "fall"
and "spring" can be adjectives as well. Altogether the sentence has four parses:*

[S [S [NP Fall leaves] fall] and [S [NP spring leaves] spring]
[S [S [NP Fall leaves] fall] and [S spring [VP leaves spring]
[S [S Fall [VP leaves fall] and [S [NP spring leaves] spring]
[S [S Fall [VP leaves fall]] and [S spring [VP leaves spring]

4. The parse [S Fall [VP leaves fall] is equivalent to “Autumn abandons autumn.”
