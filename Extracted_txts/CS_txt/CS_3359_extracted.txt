superclass links all the way up or down the tree.) There is also one opposite listed (OP), many
superclass relations (=>), and for each verb, a list of subcategorization frames (*>). Finally, a
few of the other entries with "ride" are listed to give an idea of the breadth of coverage. Note

LING UP THE GRAMMAR

Figure 23.8 shows two examples ofreal-life language. These examples contrast with our simple £2

language in many ways. In tokenization, we have to deal with hyphenation (e.g., smal- lest),

unusual punctuation conventions (e.g., fnct1()), and formatting (the unindented DESCRIP-
TION indicating a section header). Lexically, we have novel words like cmd and FD_CLOEXEC
Syntactically, we have an odd sort of conjunction (read/write); apposition of two noun phrases
(the argument fd); the "greater than or equal to" construction, which can be treated either as
an idiom or an unusual disjunction of post-nominal modifiers; and the fact that "the same file
pointer" is the object of "shares," even though there are a dozen words between them. And then
there is the 67-word alleged sentence, which is actually a convoluted subordinate clause at best.
To make any sense at all out of these real-life examples requires much more sophistication
at every step of the language interpretation process. In this section, we extend £; to yield £3, a

language that covers much more, but still has a long way to go.
