APPOSITION

 

 

 

can hold between two nouns in a nominal compound. We can then write logical rules that say,
for example, that when a UsedFor relation holds between two objects, we can infer that a NN
relation holds. Some examples are shown in Figure 23.9.

We would like a noun phrase like "every file input" to get the semantic interpretation:

[V/A z Inputli)A File(fYA NN(G,f)
Given what we have already decided about representing the semantics of NPs and articles, we
can get this ifwe arrange for the semantics of the nominal compound "file input" to be

Af Az Input(i)A File(A NNG.S)
And we can get that with the rule

Noun(\y 3x semi(x) A sem2(y) A NN(x,y))— Noun(sem) Noun(sem2)
Another complication is that two noun phrases (not two Nouns) can be concatenated together
in a construction called apposition, in which both noun phrases refer to the same thing. Two
examples are “[,pthe argument] [yp fd]” and “[yp the language] [yp POSTSCRIPT].” In these
examples, the second NP is a name, but it need not always be. In “[ypDavid McDonald] /NP the
CMU grad] wrote about nominal compounds" we are using "the CMU grad” to distinguish this
David McDonald from the other one.° A simplified rule for apposition is

NP([gx sem\ A sem;]) > NP([gx sem,]) NP([qx sem2])

Adjective Phrases

In £2, adjectives were only allowed as complements to a verb, as in "the wumpus is smelly"
But of course adjectives also appear as modifiers before a noun, as in "a smelly wumpus." The
semantics of a phrase like this can be formed by a conjunction of the semantics contributed by
the adjective and by the noun:

Aw Smellyov)A Wumpus(w)

© This is called a restrictive apposition because it restricts the set of possible references. Nonrestrictive appositionsjust
add new information. They are often set offby commas or dashes, as in “Tarzan, lord of the jungle."
