semantics of names. The simplest choice is to represent "John" with the constant John. Then
the representation of "John slept" is 3e e £ Sleep(John, Past). But this simple approach does
not work in a world with more than one thing called John. A better representation is therefore
3x e e Sleep([3!x Name(x) = John], Past). Here are rules that derive that representation:

NP(case, Person(3),number, [3!.x Name(x) = name]) — Name(number, name)
Name(Singular, John) — John

A noun also needs no determiner if it is a mass noun (e.g., "water") or a generic plural (e.g.,
"Dogs like bones"). We leave these rules as exercises.

Clausal complements

In €), all the verbs took only noun phrases and prepositional phrases as complements. But
some verbs accept clauses (i.e., sentences or certain types of verb phrases) as complements. For
example, in "I believe [he has left],” the object of "believe" is a sentence, and in "I want [to
go there],” the object of want is an infinitive verb phrase. We can handle this with the same
subcategorization mechanism we have been using (here shown without the other augmentations):

VP(subcat)— VP({S|subcat})S
VP(subcat)— VP([VP|subcat])VP

Verb((S]) — believe
Verb([VP])— want

Relative clauses

The grammar of £) allows relative clauses such as "the person [that saw me],” in which the
relative clause consists of the word "that" followed by a VP, and the interpretation is that the
head noun phrase (the person) is the subject of the embedded VP. In English, it is also possible
to have relative clauses such as "the person [that I saw ,,],” in which a sentence follows the word
"that," but the sentence is missing an object. The .,symbol, which we call a gap’ indicates the
place where the head noun phrase (the person) logically would appear to complete the sentence.
We say that the head noun phrase is the filler of the gap. In this example, the gap is in the direct
object position, but it could be nested farther into the relative clause. For example, it could be
the object of a preposition (e.g., "the person [thatI looked [pp at ,,]]") or the object of a deeply
nested clause:

the person [that [5 you said [5 you thought [s I gave the book to, J]]]

So far, all the syntactic relationships we have seen have been at a single level in the parse tree.
The filler-gap relationship is called a long-distance dependency because it reaches down a
potentially unbounded number of nodes into the parse tree. The subscripts ()on parse nodes are
used to show that there is an identity relationship—that the recipient of the book giving is the
same as "the person" that is the head noun phrase:

[the person]; [that [s you said [s you thought [s1 gave the book to uj]]I]

7 The gap is called a trace in some theories.
