Figure 5.9 A typical backgammon position. The aim of the game is to move all one's pieces
off the board. White moves clockwise toward 25, and black moves counterclockwise toward 0. A
piece can move to any position except one where there are two or more ofthe opponent's pieces.
If it moves to a position with one opponent piece, that piece is captured and has to start itsjourney
again from the beginning. In this position, white has just rolled 6-5 and has four legal moves
(5-10,5-11), (5-11,19-24), (5-10,10-16), and (S-11,11-16).
