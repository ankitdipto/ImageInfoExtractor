720 Chapter 23. Practical Natural Language Processing

 

 

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES

Locke and Booth (1955) present the very early protohistory ofmachine translation, and capture the
enthusiasm of the early days. Later disillusionment with machine translation is described by Bar-
Hillel (1960); Lindsay (1963) also points out some of the obstacles to machine translation having
to do with the interaction between syntax and semantics, and the need for world knowledge
Quinlan and O'Brien (1992) describe TAUM-METEO. Voorhees (1993) reports some recent
applications based on Wordnet.

One problem with the prototype natural language interfaces we describe—LUNAR (Woods,
1972), CHAT (Pereira, 1983), and TEAM (Grosz et al., 1987), is that they are necessarily incom-
plete. In the mid-1980s, several companies invested the effort to build serious natural language
database access programs. Artificial Intelligence Corporation's INTELLECT (Harris, 1984) is one
of the best known. With a decade of tuning it performs better than a prototype, but still has
the difficult problem of revealing to the user its range of competence. The NL-MENU system
(Tennant et al., 1983) mitigates this problem by using a mode of interaction in which the user
builds a query by selecting words and phrases from a series of on-screen menus instead of typing.
In other words, the system reveals what it is capable ofaccepting rather than attempting to handle
anything the user throws at it

The fundamental advances in efficient, general parsing methods were made in the late
1960s, with a few twists since then (Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967; Earley, 1970; Graham et al.,
1980). Maxwell and Kaplan (1993) show how chart parsing with non-context-free grammars can
be made efficient in the average case. Church and Patil (1982) introduce some refinements in the
resolution of syntactic ambiguity. A number of researchers have attempted to use quantitative
measures of the goodness of syntactic and semantic fit in parsing and semantic interpretation.
This can either be done within a basically deductive framework (Hobbs et al., 1993) or within
the framework of Bayesian belief network reasoning (Charniak and Goldman, 1992; Wu, 1993).

Nunberg (1979) gives an outline ofa computational model of metonymy. Lakoffand John-
son (1980) give an engaging analysis and catalog of common metaphors in English. Ortony (1979)
presents a collection of articles on metaphor; Helman (1988) focuses on analogical reasoning, but
also contains a number of articles about the phenomenon of metaphor. Martin (1990) presents a
computational approach to metaphor interpretation.

Kukich (1992) surveys the literature on spelling correction.

Hobbs (1990) outlines the theory of discourse coherence on which this chapter's exposition
is based. Mann and Thompson (1983) give a similar catalog of coherence relations. Grimes
(1975) lays the groundwork for much of this work. Grosz and Sidner (1986) present a theory of
discourse coherence based on shifting focus of attention. Joshi, Webber, and Sag (1981) collect
important early work in the field. Webber presents a model of the interacting constraints of
syntax and discourse on what can be said at any pointin the discourse (1983) and of the way verb
tense interacts with discourse (1988). The idea of tracking the characters’ goals and plans as a
means of understanding stories was first studied by Wilensky (Wilensky, 1983). A plan-based
model of speech acts was suggested first by Cohen and Perrault (1979). Cohen, Morgan, and
Pollack (1990) collect more recent work in this area.
