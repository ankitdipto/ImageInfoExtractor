The (k, j) entry of V, is wf’, for j,k = 0,1,..., n —1. The exponents of the
entries of V,, form a multiplication table.

For the inverse operation, which we write as a = DFT;'(y), we proceed by
multiplying y by the matrix V,~', the inverse of V,,.

Theorem 30.7
For j,k =0,1,...,1—1, the (j,k) entry of V7! is a7 /n.

Proof We show that V1 V, = In, the n x n identity matrix. Consider the (j, j’)
entry of Vi' Va:

n-1
Vein = SiO," /mok")
k=0

n-l
= Voll.
k=0

This summation equals | if j’ = j, and it is 0 otherwise by the summation lemma
(Lemma 30.6). Note that we rely on —(n — 1) < j’— j <n—1, so that j’— j is
not divisible by , in order for the summation lemma to apply. .

Given the inverse matrix V,-!, we have that DFT," () is given by

for j = 0,1,..., n —1. By comparing equations (30.8) and (30.11), we see that
by modifying the FFT algorithm to switch the roles of a and y, replace w,, by w;,',
and divide each element of the result by n, we compute the inverse DFT (see Ex-
ercise 30.2-4). Thus, we can compute DFT,,' in O(n lg) time as well.

We see that, by using the FFT and the inverse FFT, we can transform a poly-
nomial of degree-bound n back and forth between its coefficient representation
and a point-value representation in time ©(n lg). In the context of polynomial
multiplication, we have shown the following.
