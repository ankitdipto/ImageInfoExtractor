Summary 723

 

23.13 Implement a version of the chart-parsing algorithm that returns a packed tree ofall edges
that span the entire input.

23.14 Implement a version of the chart-parsing algorithm that returns a packed tree for the
longest leftmost edge, and then if that edge does not span the whole input, continues the parse
from the end ofthat edge. Show why you will need to call PREDICT before continuing. The final
result is a list of packed trees such that the list as a whole spans the input.
