In which we connect the computer to the raw, unwashed world.

24.1__ INTRODUCTION

Perception provides agents with information about the world they inhabit. Perception is initiated
SENSORS by sensors. A sensor is anything that can change the computational state of the agent in response
to achange in the state ofthe world. It could be as simple as a one-bit sensor that detects whether
a switch is on or off, or as complex as the retina of the human eye, which contains more than a
hundred million photosensitive elements.

There are a variety of sensory modalities that are available to artificial agents. Those they
share with humans include vision, hearing, and touch. In this chapter, our focus will be on vision,
because this is by far the most useful sense for dealing with the physical world. Hearing in the
context of speech recognition is also covered briefly in Section 24.7. Touch, or tactile sensing,
is discussed in Chapter 25, where we examine its use in dextrous manipulation by robots

We will not have all that much to say about the design of sensors themselves. The main
focus will be on the processing of the raw information that they provide. The basic approach
taken is to first understand how sensory stimuli are created by the world, and then to ask the
following question: ifsensory stimuli are produced in such and such a way by the world, then
what must the world have been like to produce this particular stimulus? We can write a crude
mathematical analogue of this question. Let the sensory stimulus be S, and let W be the world
(where W will include the agent itself). If the function f describes the way in which the world
generates sensory stimuli, then we have

S =fW)

Now, our question is: given f and S, what can be said about W? A straightforward approach
wouldtry to calculate what the world is like by inverting the equation for generating the stimulus:

W=f-'(S)
