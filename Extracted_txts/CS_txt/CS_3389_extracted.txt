Different kinds of edges: (1) depth discontinuities; (2) surface orientation diseon-

 

 

The result is Figure 24.7(c), in which the central peak at x = 50 remains and the subsidiary peaks
are much diminished. This allows one to find the edges without getting confused by the noise.

To understand these ideas better, we need the mathematical concept of convolution. Many
useful image-processing operations such as smoothing and differentiation can be performed by
convolving the image with suitable functions.
