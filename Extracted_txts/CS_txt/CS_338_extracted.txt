Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT

Theorem 30.8 (Convolution theorem)
For any two vectors a and b of length n, where n is a power of 2,

a @ b = DFT3} (DFT, (a) - DFT, (b)) .

where the vectors a and b are padded with Os to length 27 and - denotes the com-
ponentwise product of two 2n-element vectors. .

30.2-3
Do Exercise 30. 1-1 by using the @(n lgm)-time scheme.

30.24
Write pseudocode to compute DFT,,' in @(n Ign) time.

30.2-5
Describe the generalization of the FFT procedure to the case in which n is a power
of 3. Give a recurrence for the running time, and solve the recurrence.

Suppose that instead of performing an n-element FFT over the field of complex
numbers (where n is even), we use the ring Z,, of integers modulo m, where
m= 2'"/2 4 ] and ¢ is an arbitrary positive integer. Use @ = 2° instead of w,
as a principal nth root of unity, modulo m. Prove that the DFT and the inverse DFT
are well defined in this system.

Given a list of values Zo, Z1,.... Zn—1 (possibly with repetitions), show how to find
the coefficients of a polynomial P(x) of degree-bound n + | that has zeros only
at Zo,Z1,..-, Zn—1 (possibly with repetitions). Your procedure should run in time
O(n lg? n). (Hint: The polynomial P(x) has a zero at z; if and only if P(x) isa
multiple of (x — z;).)
