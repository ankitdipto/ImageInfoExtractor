a good way to find edges in (a).

 

Convolution with linear filters

The result of convolving two functions f and g is the new function h, denoted as h = j* g, which
is defined by

for continuous and discrete domains respectively. Typically, the functions fand g that we work
with take nonzero values only in some finite interval, so the summation can be easily performed
on a computer.

The generalization to functions defined on two dimensions (such as images) is straightfor-
ward. We replace the 1 -D integrals (or sums) by 2-D integrals (or sums). The result of convolving
two functions f and g is the new function /, denoted as h = f* g, which is defined by
