Cross-correlation works best when there is texture in the scene, resulting in windows containing
significant brightness variation among the pixels. If one is looking at a uniform white wall, then
the cross-correlation is going to be nearly the same for the different candidate matches g, and the
algorithm is reduced to making a blind guess.
Suppose that the viewer has translational velocity T and angular velocity w (which thus
EGOMOTION describe the egomotion). One can derive an equation relating the viewer velocities, the optical
flow, and the positions of objects in the scene. In fact, assuming f = 1,

where Z/x, y) gives the z-coordinate of the scene point corresponding to the image point at (x, y).
One can get a good intuition by considering the case of pure translation. In that case, the
flow field becomes

One can observe some interesting properties. Both components of the optical flow, v(x, y) and
ESM RSou v(x, ¥), are Zero at the pointx = 7,/T,,v= 7,/T,. This point is called the focus of expansion of

the flow field. Suppose we change the origin in the xy plane to lie at the focus of expansion;
then the expressions for optical flow take on a particularly simple form. Let (x’,)’) be the new
coordinates defined by.” =x - T,/T.,y =y - T,/T,. Then
