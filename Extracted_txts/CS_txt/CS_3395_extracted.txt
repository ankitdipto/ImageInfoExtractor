This equation has some interesting applications. Suppose you are a fly trying to land on wall,
and you want to know the time to contact at the current velocity. This time is given by Z/T;.
Note that although the instantaneous optical flow field cannot provide either the distance Z or the
velocity component T,, it can provide the ratio of the two, and can therefore be used to control
the landing approach. Experiments with real flies show that this is exactly what they use.

To recover depth, one should make use of multiple frames. If the camera is looking at a
rigid body, the shape does not change from frame to frame and thus we are able to better deal
with the inherently noisy optical flow measurements. Results from one such approach due to
Tomasi and Kanade (1992) are shown in Figures 24.10 and 24.11.

Binocular stereopsis

The idea here is rather similar to motion parallax, except that instead of using images over time,
‘Wwe use two (or more) images separated in space, such as are provided by the forward-facing eyes
of humans. Because a given feature in the scene will be in a different place relative to the z-axis
of each image plane, if we superpose the two images, there will be a disparity in the location of
