crease protruding toward the camera. Behind the box is a flat surface.

 

 

 

algorithm uses the ordering constraint and deals with depth discontinuities where the windows at
corresponding points in the image are not sampling corresponding patches in the scene. Because
of occlusion in one of the views, there is a strip seen only in one eye. Note also the use of
stereopsis for scene segmentation as demonstrated in Figure 24.16(c).

A standard criticism of area-based matching approaches is that they are susceptible to
errors when corresponding patches in the two images do not look similar. This can happen for a
variety of reasons: (1) the surface reflectance function has an appreciable specular component,
