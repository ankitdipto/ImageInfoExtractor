so the brightness ofa point in the scene is a function of viewpoint; (2) there is a differing amount
of foreshortening in the two views, because the patch makes different angles to the optical axes
in the two views.

Another family of approaches is based on first finding edges and then looking for matches.
Edges are deemed compatible if they are near enough in orientation and have the same sign of
contrast across the edge. Corresponding edges are usually assumed to obey the same left-to-right
ordering in each image, which allows one to restrict the number of possible matches and lends
itself to efficient algorithms based on dynamic programming. With any edge-based approach,
however, the resulting depth information is sparse, because it is available only at edge locations.
Thus, a further step is needed to interpolate depth across surfaces in the scene.

Texture gradients

Texture in everyday language is a property of surfaces associated with the tactile quality they
suggest (texture has the same root as textile). In computational vision, itrefers to a closely related
concept, that of a spatially repeating pattern on a surface that can be sensed visually. Examples
