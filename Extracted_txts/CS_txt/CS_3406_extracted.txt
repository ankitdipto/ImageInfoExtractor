Figure 24.21 The four kinds of trihedral vertices.

 

 

 

The four ways in which three plane surfaces can come together at a vertex are shown in
Figure 24.21. These cases have been constructed by taking a cube and dividing it into eight
octants. We want to generate the different possible trihedral vertices at the center of the cube
by filling in various octants. The vertex labeled 1 corresponds to 1 filled octant, 3 to 3 filled
octants, and so on. Readers should convince themselves that these are indeed ail the possibilities.
For example, if one fills two octants in a cube, one cannot construct a valid trihedral vertex at
the center. Note also that these four cases correspond to different combinations of convex and
concave edges that meet at the vertex.

The three edges meeting at the vertex partition the surrounding space into eight octants.
A vertex can be viewed from any of the octants not occupied by solid material. Moving the
viewpoint within a single octant does not result in a picture with different junction types. The
vertex labeled 1 in Figure 24.21 can be viewed from any of the remaining seven octants to give
the junction labels in Figure 24.22.
