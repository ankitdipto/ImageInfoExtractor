An exhaustive listing of the different ways each vertex can be viewed results in the possi-
bilities shown in Figure 24.23. We get four different junction types which can be distinguished
in the image: L-, Y-, arrow, and T-junctions. L-junctions correspond to two visible edges. Y-
and arrow junctions correspond to a triple of edges—in a Y-junction none of the three angles is
greater than 7, T-junctions are associated with occlusion. When a nearer, opaque surface blocks
the view of a more distant edge, one obtains a continuous edge meeting a half edge. The four
T-junction labels correspond to the occlusion of four different types of edges

When using this junction dictionary to find a labeling for the line drawing, the problem is
to determine which junction interpretations are globally consistent. Consistency is forced by the
rule that each line in the picture must be assigned one and only one label along its entire length.
