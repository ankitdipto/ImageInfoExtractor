of the projection of the lane in the image, one knows where to look for the lane markers in the
imageâ€”in the figure, this is indicated by showing the search windows.

For longitudinal control, one needs to know distances to the vehicles in front. This can be
accomplished using binocular stereopsis or optical flow. Both these approaches can be simplified
by exploiting the domain constraints derived from the fact that one is driving on a planar surface.
Using these techniques, Dickmanns and Zapp (1987) have demonstrated visually controlled car
driving on freeways at high speeds. Pomerleau (1993) achieved similar performance using a
neural network approach (see discussion on page 586).

The driving example makes one point very clear: for a specific task, one does not need
to recover all the information that in principle can be recovered from an image. One does
not need to recover the exact shape of every vehicle, solve for shape-from-texture on the grass
surface adjacent to the freeway, and so on. The needs of the task require only certain kinds of
information and one can gain considerable computational speed and robustness by recovering
only that information and fully exploiting the domain constraints. Our purpose in discussing the
general approaches in the previous section was that they form the basic theory, which one can
specialize for the needs of particular tasks.
