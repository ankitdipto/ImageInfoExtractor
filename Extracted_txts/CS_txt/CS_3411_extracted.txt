24.6 OBJECT REPRESENTATION AND RECOGNITION

The object recognition problem can be defined as follows. Given

 

1. a scene consisting of one or more objects chosen from a collection of objects 01, O2,
known a priori, and

2. an image of the scene taken from an unknown viewer position and orientation,
determine the following:

1. Which of the objects O;, 02, ..., O, are present in the scene.
2. For each such object, determine its position and orientation relative to the viewer.

Obviously, this determination requires prior storage of suitable descriptions of the objects.

This problem is clearly of considerable industrial importance. For example, in an assembly
process, the robot has to identify the different components and compute their positions and orien-
tations in order to generate a grasping or pick-and-place strategy. In addition to the engineering
standpoint, the problem is of great scientific interest. Humans have the impressive ability to rec-
ognize thousands of objects almost instantaneously even when the objects are partially occluded
or presented in highly simplified line drawings.

The two fundamental issues that any object recognition scheme must address are the
representation ofthe models and the matching of models to images.
