Figure 24.31 (a) A scene containing a number of objects, two of which also appearin the model
library. These are recognized using invariants based on lines and conies. The image shows 100
fitted lines and 27 fitted conies superimposed in white. Invariants are formed from combinations
oflines and conies, and the values index into a model library. In this case, there are 35 models in
the library. Note that many lines are caused by texture, and that some of the conies correspond to
edge data over only a small section. (b) The two objects from the library are recognized correctly.
The lock striker plate is matched with a single invariant and 50.9% edge match, and the spanner
with three invariants and 70.7% edge match. Courtesy of Andrew Zisserman.
