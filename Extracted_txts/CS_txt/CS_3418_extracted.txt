fie SEARCH

Iterative deepening search is a strategy that sidesteps the issue of choosing the best depth
limit by trying all possible depth limits: first depth 0, then depth 1, then depth 2, and so on.
The algorithm is shown in Figure 3,15, In effect, iterative deepening combines the benefits of
depth-first and breadth-first search. It is optimal and complete, like breadth-first search, but has
only the modest memory requirements of depth-first search. The order of expansion of states is
similar to breadth-first, except that some states are expanded multiple times. Figure 3.16 shows
the first four iterations of ITERATIVE-DEEPENING-SEARCH on a binary search tree.

Iterative deepening search may seem wasteful, because so many states are expanded
multiple times. For most problems, however, the overhead of this multiple expansion is actually
