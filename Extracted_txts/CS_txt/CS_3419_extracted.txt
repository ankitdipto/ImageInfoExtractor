Signal processing

Sound is an analog energy source. When a sound wave strikes a microphone, it is converted to
an electrical current, which can be passed to an analog-to-digital converter to yield a stream of
bits representing the sound. We have two choices in deciding how many bits to keep. First, the
sampling rate is the frequency with which we look at the signal. For speech, a sampling rate
between 8 and 16 KHz (i.c., 8 to 16,000 times per second) is typical. Telephones deliver only
about 3 KHz. Second, the quantization factor determines the precision to which the energy at
each sampling point is recorded. Speech recognizers typically keep 8 to 12 bits. That means
that a low-end system, sampling at 8 KHz with 8-bit quantization, would require nearly half a
megabyte per minute of speech. This is a lot of information to manipulate, and worse, it leaves
us very far from our goal of discovering the phones that make up the signal

The first step in coming up with a better representation for the signal is to group the samples
together into larger blocks called frames. This makes it possible to analyze the whole frame for
the appearance of speech phenomena such as a rise or drop in frequency, or a sudden onset or
cessation of energy. A frame length of about 10 msecs (i.e., 80 samples at 8 KHz) seems to be
long enough so that most such phenomena can be detected and that few short-duration phenomena
will be missed. Within each frame, we represent what is happening with a vector of features. For
example, we might want to characterize the amount ofenergy at each of several frequency ranges.
