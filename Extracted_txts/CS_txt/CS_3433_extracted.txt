EXERCISES

24.1 In the shadow of a tree with a dense, leafy canopy, one sees a number of light spots |
Surprisingly, they all appear to be circular. Why? After all, the gaps between the leaves through
which the sun shines through are not likely to be circular.

24.2 Label the line drawing in Figure 24.38, assuming that the outside edges have been labelled
as occluding and that all vertices are trihedral. Do this by a backtracking algorithm that examines
the vertices in the order A, B, C, and D, picking at each stage a choice consistent with previously
labelled junctions and edges. Now try the vertices in the order B, D, A, and C.

243 Consider an infinitely long cylinder of radius r oriented with its axis along the y-axis. The
cylinder has a Lambertian surface and is viewed by a camera along the positive z-axis. What will
you expect.to see in the image of the cylinder if the cylinder is illuminated by a point source at
infinity located on the positive x-axis. Explain your answer by drawing the isobrightness contours
in the projected image. Are the contours of equal brightness uniformly spaced?

244 Edges in an image can correspond to a variety of scene events. Consider the photograph
on the cover of your book and assume that it is a picture of a real 3-D scene. Identify a set
of ten different brightness edges in the image, and for each, decide whether it corresponds to a
discontinuity in (a) depth, (b) surface normal, (c) reflectance, or (d) illumination

24.5 Show that convolution with a given function fcommutes with differentiation, that is,

(f+ 9) =fee!
