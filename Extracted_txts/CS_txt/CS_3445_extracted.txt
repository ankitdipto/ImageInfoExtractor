Ultimately, the effectors are driven by electrical (or other) signals. Some effectors only
accept on/off signals, some accept scalar values (e.g., turn right 3°), and some robot development
environments provide higher level subroutine libraries or have complete languages for specifying
actions that can be turned into primitive signals

Sensors: Tools for perception

Chapter 24 covered the general principles of perception, using vision as the main example. In
this section, we describe the other kinds of sensors that provide percepts for a robot.

Proprioception

Like humans, robots have a proprioceptive‘ sense that tells them where theirjoints are. Encoders
fitted to the joints provide very accurate data about joint angle or extension. If the output of the
encoder is fed back to the control mechanism during motion, the robot can have much greater
positioning accuracy than humans. For a manipulator, this typically translates to around a few
mils (thousandths of an inch) of accuracy in its end-effector position. In contrast, humans can
manage only a centimeter or two. To test this for yourself, place your finger at one end of a ruler
(or some other object whose length is familiar). Then with your eyes closed try to touch the other

+ The word proprioceptive is derived from the same source as proprietary, and thus means "perception of privately
owned (ie., internal) stimuli.”
