end. You should do better after a few tries, which shows that your positioning repeatability is
better than your accuracy. The same is usually true for robots.

Mobots can measure their change in position using odometry, based on sensors that
measure wheel rotation (or, in the case of stepper motors that rotate a fixed angle per step, the
number of steps). Unfortunately, because of slippage as the robot moves, the position error
from wheel motion deteriorates as the robot moves, and may be several percent of the distance
travelled. Orientation can be measured more reliably, using a magnetic compass or a gyroscope
system. Accelerometers can measure the change in velocity.

Force sensing

Even though robots can sense and control the positions of their joints much more accurately
than humans, there are still many tasks that cannot be carried out using only position sensing.
Consider, for example, the task of scraping paint off a windowpane using a razor blade. To get
all the paint requires positioning accuracy of about a micron in the direction perpendicular to
the glass. An error of a millimeter would cause the robot to either miss the paint altogether or
break the glass. Obviously, humans are not doing this using position control alone. This and
