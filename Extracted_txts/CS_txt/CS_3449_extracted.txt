ARCHITECTURES

In this section, we step back from the nuts and bolts of robots and look at the overall control
mechanism. The architecture of a robot defines how the job of generating actions from per-
cepts is organized. We will largely be concemed with autonomous mobile robots in dynamic
environments, for which the need for a sophisticated control architecture is clear.

The design of robot architectures is essentially the same agent design problem that we
discussed in Chapter 2. We saw in the introduction to the current chapter that the environment for
mobile robots is toward the difficult end as environments go. Furthermore, the perceptual input
available to a robot is often voluminous; nevertheless, the robot needs to react quickly in some
situations. In the following subsections, we briefly describe a variety of architectures, ranging
