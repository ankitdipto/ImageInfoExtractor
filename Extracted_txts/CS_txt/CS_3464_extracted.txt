"minimal" description of free space. They avoid an explicit description of the boundary of free
space, and this can provide considerable time savings. There is only one kind of data structure
needed to describe skeleton curves, and this helps simplify implementation.

To be complete for motion planning, skeletonization methods must satisfy two properties:

1. IfS is a skeleton of free space F, then S should have a single connected piece within each
connected region of F,

2. For any point p in F, it should be "easy" to compute a path from p to the skeleton.

The second condition is rather vague, but it will become clearer from the examples of skele-
tonization methods coming up. The condition is crucial, because otherwise we could construct a
skeleton that consisted of a single point in each connected region of F. Such a skeleton would be
a procrastination of the planning problem, rather than a solution of it. There are many types of
skeletonization methods in two dimensions. These include visibility graphs, Voronoi diagrams,
and roadmaps. We briefly describe each in turn.

The visibility graph for a polygonal configuration space C consists of edges joining all
pairs of vertices that can see each other. That is, there is an unobstructed straight linejoining those
vertices. It is shown in Figure 25.15. To see that the visibility graph is complete for planning,
we need only observe that the shortest path between two points with polygonal obstacles lies
entirely on the visibility graph, except for its first and last segment (see Exercise 25.7)
