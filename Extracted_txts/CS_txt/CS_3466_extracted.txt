in every connected piece ofFâ€™s cross section. See Figure 25.17. To get silhouette curves
from these extremal points, we simply allow c to vary, and follow the extremal points in Y
as the plane Y = c moves throughF.

e Linking curves join critical points to silhouette curves. Critical points are points where
the cross section Y = c changes abruptly as c varies. By referring to Figure 25.17, the
reader will find two critical points where the cross-section changes. If the critical point
has X-coordinate co, then for.X < co, the cross-section is an hourglass-shaped curve. For
X > cg side, the hourglass has pinched off into two circles. We will call a slice X = c
containing a critical point a "critical slice." Linking curves can be defined several ways, but
