Figure 25.19 A 2-D environment, velocity uncertainty cone, and envelope of possible robot
motions. The intended velocity is v, but with uncertainty the actual velocity could be anywhere
in Cy, resulting in a final configuration somewhere in the motion envelope, which means we

wouldn't know ifwe hit the hole or not.

No matter what the error, we know the final configuration will be to the left of the hole.

error, we will eventually get into the hole.
