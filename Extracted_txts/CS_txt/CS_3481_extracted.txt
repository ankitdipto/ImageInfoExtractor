25.13 For the environment and motion uncertainty cone shown in Figure 25.28, find a navigation
strategy that is guaranteed to reach the goal G.

25.14 Here are the three laws ofrobotics from the science fiction book /, Robot (Asimov, 1950):
1. A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to
harm.

2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would 4
conflict with the first law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the
first or second law.

 

So far, only a few attempts have been made to build such safeguards into robotic software (Weld
and Etzioni, 1994),

a. How would you design a robot to obey these laws? What type of architecture would be

best? What aspects of the laws are hard to obey?

Are the laws sensible? That is, if it were possible to build a sophisticated robot, would you
want it to be govemed by them? Can you think of a better set of laws?
