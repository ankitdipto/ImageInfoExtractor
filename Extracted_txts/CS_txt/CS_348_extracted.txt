Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT

c. Show that if we compute each 1-dimensional DFT by computing the fast Four-
ier transform, the total time to compute a d-dimensional DFT is O(n lgn),
independent of d.

30-4 Evaluating all derivatives of a polynomial at a point

Given a polynomial A(x) of degree-bound n, we define its tth derivative by
A(x) iff=0,

AM(x) = 1 FAM) ifl <t<n-1,

0 ift>n.
From the coefficient representation (ao,d1,.... d,-1) of A(x) and a given point xo,
we wish to determine A (xo) for f = 0,1,...,2 —1.
a. Given coefficients bo,b;,..., b,—1 such that

n-l
A(x) = D2 bi (x= 0),
j=0

show how to compute A (xo), for ¢ = 0,1,...,n — 1, in O(n) time.

b. Explain how to find bo,)1,..., b,-1 in O(nlgn) time, given A(xXo + ok) for
k=0,1,....2-1.

c. Prove that

n-1 kr mol

r=0 j=0

 

where f(j) = aj-j! and

xs /(-D! if-(n—1) <1 <0,
pn=l* sts
Bi {5 ifl<l<n-1.

d. Explain how to evaluate A(x) + wf) fork = 0,1,..., n—1 in O(nlgn)
time. Conclude that we can evaluate all nontrivial derivatives of A(x) at x9 in
O(nlgn) time.
