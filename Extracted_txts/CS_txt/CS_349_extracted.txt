30-5 Polynomial evaluation at multiple points

We have seen how to evaluate a polynomial of degree-bound n at a single point in
O(n) time using Homer’s rule. We have also discovered how to evaluate such a
polynomial at all 7 complex roots of unity in O(n lgn) time using the FFT. We
shall now show how to evaluate a polynomial of degree-bound n at n arbitrary
points in O(n lg? n) time.

To do so, we shall assume that we can compute the polynomial remainder when
one such polynomial is divided by another in O(n lg 7) time, a result that we state
without proof. For example, the remainder of 3x3 + x? — 3x + 1 when divided by
x? +x +42 is

(3x3 +x? — 3x +1) mod (x? +x +2) =—7x 45.

Given the coefficient representation of a polynomial A(x) = To ayx* and
Nn points X9,Xq,..., Xn-1, We wish to compute the n values A(X), A(x1).-...
A(X,—-1). For 0 <i < j <n — 1, define the polynomials P;;(x) = [],_;(% — xx)
and Q;;(x) = A(x) mod P;;(x). Note that Q;;(x) has degree at most j —i.

a. Prove that A(x) mod (x — z) = A(z) for any point z.
b. Prove that Oxy (x) = A(x) and that Qo,,—-1(x) = A(x).

c. Prove that fori < k < j, we have Ojx(x) = Qj; (x) mod Pix(x) and
Oxj (x) = Qij(x) mod Py (x).

d. Give an O(n lg? n)-time algorithm to evaluate A(x), A(x1),.--. A(Xn-1).

30-6 FFT using modular arithmetic

As defined, the discrete Fourier transform requires us to compute with complex
numbers, which can result in a loss of precision due to round-off errors. For some
problems, the answer is known to contain only integers, and by using a variant of
the FFT based on modular arithmetic, we can guarantee that the answer is calcu-
lated exactly. An example of such a problem is that of multiplying two polynomials
with integer coefficients. Exercise 30.2-6 gives one approach, using a modulus of
length Q(n) bits to handle a DFT on n points. This problem gives another ap-
proach, which uses a modulus of the more reasonable length O(lg 1); it requires
that you understand the material of Chapter 31. Let 1 be a power of 2.

a. Suppose that we search for the smallest k such that p = kn + 1 is prime. Give
a simple heuristic argument why we might expect k to be approximately Inn.
(The value of k might be much larger or smaller, but we can reasonably expect
to examine O(lg 7) candidate values of k on average.) How does the expected
length of p compare to the length of 1?
