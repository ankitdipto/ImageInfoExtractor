In this chapter we introduce a basic computer and show how its operation can
be specified with register transfer statements. The organization of the com-
puter is defined by its internal cegisters, the timing and control structure,
and the set of instructions that it uses. The design of the computer is then
castied outin detail. Although the basic computer presented in this chapter is
very small compared to commercial computers, it has the advantage of being
simple enough 60 we can demonstrate the design proce without too many
complications.

â€˜The internal organization of a digital system is defined by the sequence
of microoperations it perfurms on date stored in its registers. The genera
purpose digitel computer is capable of executing various microoperations and,
inaddition, canbeinstructed as to what specific sequence of operations it must
perform. The user of a computer can contral the process by means of a
frogram. A program is a set of instructions shat specify the operations,
