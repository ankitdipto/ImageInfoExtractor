B.3 THE CODE REPOSITORY

The pseudo-code in the book is meant to be easy to read and understand, but it is not easy to
run on a computer. To fix this problem, we have provided a repository of working code. Most
of the algorithms in the book are implemented, as well as a set of basic tools not covered in the
book. Currently, the algorithms are all written in Lisp, although we may add other languages in
the future. Ifyou are reading this book as part of a course, your instructor will probably retrieve
the code for you. Ifnot, send an electronic mail message to

aima-request@cs.berkeley.edu

with the word "help" in the subject line or in the body. You will receive a return message with
instructions on how to get the code. (We don't print the instructions here because they are subject
to frequent change.) You can also order the code on a floppy disk by writing to Prentice-Hall
Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632.

B.4__ COMMENTS

Ifyou have any comments on the book, any typos you have noticed, or any suggestions on how
it can be improved, we would like to hear from you. Please send a message to

aima-bug@cs.berkeley.edu

or write to us in care of Prentice-Hall.
