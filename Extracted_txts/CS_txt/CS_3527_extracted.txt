The digital computer is a digital system that performs various computational
tasks. The word digital implies that the information in the computer is repre-
sented by var ables that take a limited number of discrete values. These values
are grocessed internally by components that can maintaina limited aumber of
discrete states. The decimal digits 0, 1, 2,..., 9, for example, provide 10
discrete values. The first electronic digital computers, developed in the late
1940s, were used Primarily for numerical compulations. in this case the dis-
creteelements are the digits. From this application the term digital computer has
emerged. In practice. digital computers function more reliably if only two
states are used. Because of the physical restriction of components, and because
human logic tends to be binary (i.e.. trueor-false, yes-or-no statements)
digital components that are constrained to take discrete values are further
constrained to take only two values anid are said to be binary.

Digital computers use the binary number system, which has two digits:
O and 1. A binaty digit is called a bit. Information is represented in digital
computers in gioups ofits. By using various coding techruques, groups of bits
an be made to represent not only binary numbers but also other discrete
