Figure 19.4, continued â€”(i)-(1) The situation after each of the next four iterations of the for loop.
(m) Fibonacci heap H after reconstructing the root list from the array A and determining the new
H.min pointer.

The procedure CONSOLIDATE uses an auxiliary array A[0.. D(H.n)] to keep
track of roots according to their degrees. If A[i] = y, then y is currently a root
with y.degree = i. Of course, in order to allocate the array we have to know how
to calculate the upper bound D(H.n) on the maximum degree, but we will see how
to do so in Section 19.4.
