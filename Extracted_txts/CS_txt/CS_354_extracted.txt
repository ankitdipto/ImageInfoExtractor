Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

divisor of a nonzero integer a is at least 1 but not greater than |a|. For example, the
divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

Every positive integer a is divisible by the trivial divisors | and a. The nontrivial
divisors of a are the factors of a. For example, the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10.

Prime and composite numbers

An integer a > 1 whose only divisors are the trivial divisors 1 and a is a prime
number or, more simply, a prime. Primes have many special properties and play a
critical role in number theory. The first 20 primes, in order, are

2, 3, 5,7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71.

Exercise 31.1-2 asks you to prove that there are infinitely many primes. An integer
a > | that is not prime is a composite number or, more simply, a composite. For
example, 39 is composite because 3 | 39. We call the integer 1 a unit, and it is
neither prime nor composite. Similarly, the integer 0 and all negative integers are
neither prime nor composite.

The division theorem, remainders, and modular equivalence

Given an integer 7, we can partition the integers into those that are multiples of n
and those that are not multiples of n. Much number theory is based upon refining
this partition by classifying the nonmultiples of n according to their remainders
when divided by n. The following theorem provides the basis for this refinement.
We omit the proof (but see, for example, Niven and Zuckerman [265]).

Theorem 31.1 (Division theorem)
For any integer a and any positive integer 1, there exist unique integers q and r
such thatO <r <nanda=qn+r. :

The value g = |a/n| is the quotient of the division. The value r = a mod n
is the remainder (or residue) of the division. We have that n | a if and only if
amodn = 0.

We can partition the integers into 1 equivalence classes according to their re-
mainders modulo n. The equivalence class modulo n containing an integer a is

[a], ={at+tkn:keZ}.

For example, [3]7 = {...,—11,—4,3, 10, 17,...}; we can also denote this set by
[-4]7 and [10]7. Using the notation defined on page 54, we can say that writing
a & [b], is the same as writing a = b (mod n). The set of all such equivalence
classes is
