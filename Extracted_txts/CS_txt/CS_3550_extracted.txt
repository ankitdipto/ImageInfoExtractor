19.4 Bounding the maximum degree 525

Lemma 19.4
Let x be any node in a Fibonacci heap, and let k = x.degree. Then size(x) >
Frs2 > o, where $ = (1+ ¥5)/2.

Proof Let sz denote the minimum possible size of any node of degree k in any
Fibonacci heap. Trivially, so = 1 and s; = 2. The number sx is at most size(x)
and, because adding children to a node cannot decrease the node’s size, the value
of sx increases monotonically with k. Consider some node z, in any Fibonacci
heap, such that z.degree = k and size(z) = sx. Because sg < size(x), we
compute a lower bound on size(x) by computing a lower bound on sy. As in
Lemma 19.1, let yi, y2,.... yx denote the children of z in the order in which they
were linked to z. To bound s;, we count one for z itself and one for the first child y;
(for which size(y1) > 1), giving

size(x) > SK

where the last line follows from Lemma 19.1 (so that y;.degree > i — 2) and the
monotonicity of sg (so that Sy, degree = Si—2)-

We now show by induction on k that sg > F;+2 for all nonnegative integers k.
The bases, for k = 0 and k = 1, are trivial. For the inductive step, we assume that

k > 2and that s; > F;42 fori = 0,1,...,k — 1. We have

Thus, we have shown that size(x) > 5% > Furs > 6*. .
