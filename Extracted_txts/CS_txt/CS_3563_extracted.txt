Figure 20.2 (a) A tree of degree \/ superimposed on top of the same bit vector as in Figure 20.1.
Each internal node stores the logical-or of the bits in its subtree. (b) A view of the same structure,
but with the internal nodes at depth 1 treated as an array swnmmary[0.. ut — 1], where summary[i] is
the logical-or of the subarray Afi /@.. (i + 1). /w — 1].

each of the operations MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, PREDECESSOR, and
DELETE in O(,/u) time:

* To find the minimum (maximum) value, find the leftmost (rightmost) entry in
summary that contains a 1, say summary[i], and then do a linear search within
the ith cluster for the leftmost (rightmost) 1.

* To find the successor (predecessor) of x, first search to the right (left) within its
cluster. If we find a 1, that position gives the result. Otherwise, let i = |x/./U]
and search to the right (left) within the summary array from index i. The first
position that holds a 1 gives the index of a cluster. Search within that cluster
for the leftmost (rightmost) 1. That position holds the successor (predecessor).

* To delete the value x, let i = |x/,/w]]. Set A[x] to 0 and then set summary(i]
to the logical-or of the bits in the ith cluster.

In each of the above operations, we search through at most two clusters of /i bits
plus the swmmary array, and so each operation takes O(,/1) time.

At first glance, it seems as though we have made negative progress. Superimpos-
ing a binary tree gave us O(lg u)-time operations, which are asymptotically faster
than O(/u) time. Using a tree of degree /1 will turn out to be a key idea of van
Emde Boas trees, however. We continue down this path in the next section.
