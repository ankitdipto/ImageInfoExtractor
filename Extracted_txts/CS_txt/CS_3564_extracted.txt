Chapter 20 van Emde Boas Trees

20.1-2
Modify the data structures in this section to support keys that have associated satel-
lite data.

20.1-3

Observe that, using the structures in this section, the way we find the successor and
predecessor of a value x does not depend on whether x is in the set at the time.
Show how to find the successor of x in a binary search tree when x is not stored in
the tree.

20.1-4

Suppose that instead of superimposing a tree of degree /, we were to superim-
pose a tree of degree w!/*, where k > 1 is a constant. What would be the height of
such a tree, and how long would each of the operations take?

 

20.2 A recursive structure

In this section, we modify the idea of superimposing a tree of degree \/W on top of
abit vector. In the previous section, we used a summary structure of size /W, with
each entry pointing to another stucture of size ./v. Now, we make the structure
recursive, shrinking the universe size by the square root at each level of recursion.
Starting with a universe of size u, we make structures holding v7 = wu’? items,
which themselves hold structures of u'/* items, which hold structures of u!/8 items,
and so on, down to a base size of 2.

For simplicity, in this section, we assume that vu = 2" for some integer k, so
that v,w!/?, 4/4... are integers. This restriction would be quite severe in practice,
allowing only values of u in the sequence 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536, .... We shall see in
the next section how to relax this assumption and assume only that w = 2 for
some integer k. Since the structure we examine in this section is only a precursor
to the true van Emde Boas tree structure, we tolerate this restriction in favor of
aiding our understanding.

Recalling that our goal is to achieve running times of O(lglg u) for the oper-
ations, let’s think about how we might obtain such running times. At the end of
Section 4.3, we saw that by changing variables, we could show that the recurrence

T(n) = 2T (| Vn |) + 1gn (20.1)

has the solution T(n) = O(lgnlglgn). Let’s consider a similar, but simpler,
recurrence:

Tu) =T( Vu) + O11). (20.2)
