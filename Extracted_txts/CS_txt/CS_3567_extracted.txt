two variables x and y. Note that the functions are determined from the 16
binary combinations that can be assigned to F.

The 16 Boolean functions of two variables x and y are expressed in
algebraic form in the first column of Table 4-6. The 16 logic microoperations are
derived from these functions by replacing variable x by the binary content of
register A and variable y by the binary content of register B. It is important to
realize that the Boolean functions listed in the first column of Table 4-6 repre-
sent a relationship between two binary variables x and y. The logic micro-
operations listed in the second column represent a relationship between the
binary content of two registers A and B. Each bit of the register is treated as
a binary variable and the microoperation is performed on the string of bits
stored in the registers.
