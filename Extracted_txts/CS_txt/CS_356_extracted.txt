31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions 929

Zn ={[a],:0<a<n-l}. 1.1)
When you see the definition
Zn = {0.1,.... n-l}, (31.2)

you should read it as equivalent to equation (31.1) with the understanding that 0
represents [0],,, 1 represents [1],,, and so on; each class is represented by its smallest
nonnegative element. You should keep the underlying equivalence classes in mind,
however. For example, if we refer to —1 as a member of Z,,, we are really referring
to [n — 1], since —1 =n —1 (mod n).

Common divisors and greatest common divisors

If d is a divisor of a and d is also a divisor of b, then d is a common divisor of a
and b. For example, the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30, and so the
common divisors of 24 and 30 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Note that | is a common divisor
of any two integers.

An important property of common divisors is that

d|aandd |b implies d | (a+b) andd | (a—b). (31.3)
More generally, we have that
d|aandd |b implies d | (ax + by) (31.4)

for any integers x and y. Also, if a | b, then either |a| < |b| or b = 0, which
implies that

a|bandb |a implies a = +b. (31.5)

The greatest common divisor of two integers a and b, not both zero, is the
largest of the common divisors of a and b; we denote it by gcd(a, b). For example,
ged(24, 30) = 6, ged(5,7) = 1, and ged(0,9) = 9. If a and b are both nonzero,
then ged(a,b) is an integer between | and min(|a|,|b|). We define gcd(0,0) to
be 0; this definition is necessary to make standard properties of the ged function
(such as equation (31.9) below) universally valid.

The following are elementary properties of the gcd function:

ged(a,b) = gced(b,a), (31.6)
ged(a,b) = ged(—a,b), (31.7)
ged(a.b) = ged(lal,.|b)). G18)
ged(a,0) = fal. (31.9)
ged(a,ka) = |a| foranyk €Z. (31.10)

The following theorem provides an alternative and useful characterization of
ged(a,b).
