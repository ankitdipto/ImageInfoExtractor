SECTION 45 Logic Microoperations 111

Hardware Implementation

The hardware implementation of logic microoperations requires that logic
gates be inserted for each bit or pair of bits in the registers to perform the
required logic function. Although there are 16 logic microoperations, most
computers use only four—AND, OR, XOR (exclusive-OR), and complement—
from which all others can be derived.

Figure 4-10 shows one stage of a circuit that generates the four basic logic
microoperations. It consists of four gates and a multiplexer. Each of the four
logic operations is generated through a gate that performs the required logic.
The outputs of the gates are applied to the data inputs of the multiplexer. The
two selection inputs S; and Sp choose one of the data inputs of the multiplexer
and direct its value to the output. The diagram shows one typical stage with
subscript i. Fora logic circuit with » bits, the diagram must be repeated n times
fori = 0,1,2,..., 1 — 1 The selection variables are applied to all stages. The
function table in Fig. 4-10(b) lists the logic microoperations obtained for each
combination of the selection variables.

Some Applications

Logic microoperations are very useful for manipulating individual bits or a
portion of a word stored in a register. They can be used to change bit values,
delete a group of bits, or insert new bit values into a register. The following
examples show how the bits of one register (designated by A) are manipulated
