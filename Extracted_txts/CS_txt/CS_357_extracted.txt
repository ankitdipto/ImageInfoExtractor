Theorem 31.2
If a and b are any integers, not both zero, then gcd(a, b) is the smallest positive
element of the set {ax + by : x, y € Z} of linear combinations of a and b.

Proof Let s be the smallest positive such linear combination of a and b, and let
s = ax + by for some x, y € Z. Let g = |a/s|. Equation (3.8) then implies
amods = a—qs

= a—gq(ax+by)

= a(l—qx)+b(-ay) .
and so a mod s is a linear combination of a and b as well. But, since 0 <
a mod s < s,wehave that a mod s = 0, because s is the smallest positive such lin-
ear combination. Therefore, we have that s | a and, by analogous reasoning, s | b.
Thus, s is a common divisor of a and b, and so ged(a,b) > s. Equation (31.4)
implies that ged(a,b) | s, since ged(a,b) divides both a and b and s is a linear
combination of a and b. But ged(a,b) | s and s > 0 imply that ged(a,b) < s.
Combining gcd(a,b) > s and gced(a,b) < s yields gcd(a,b) = s. We conclude
that s is the greatest common divisor of a and b. .

Corollary 31.3
For any integers a and b, if d | aandd |b, thend | gcd(a,b).

Proof This corollary follows from equation (31.4), because gcd(a, b) is a linear
combination of a and b by Theorem 31.2. .

Corollary 31.4
For all integers a and b and any nonnegative integer n,

ged(an, bn) = ngcd(a,b) .
Proof \fn = 0, the corollary is trivial. If n > 0, then gcd(an, bn) is the smallest

positive element of the set {anx + bny : x,y € Z}, which is 1 times the smallest
positive element of the set {ax + by : x,y € Z}. .

Corollary 31.5
For all positive integers n, a, and b, if n | ab and ged(a,n) = 1, thenn | b.

Proof We leave the proof as Exercise 31.1-5. .
