Chapter 20 van Emde Boas Trees

sizes that are prime. Mehlhornâ€™s book [249] contains a slightly different treatment
of van Emde Boas trees than the one in this chapter.

Using the ideas behind van Emde Boas trees, Dementiev et al. [83] developed
a nonrecursive, three-level search tree that ran faster than van Emde Boas trees in
their own experiments.

Wang and Lin [347] designed a hardware-pipelined version of van Emde Boas
trees, which achieves constant amortized time per operation and uses O(lg lg u)
stages in the pipeline.

A lower bound by Patragcu and Thorup [273, 274] for finding the predecessor
shows that van Emde Boas trees are optimal for this operation, even if randomiza-
tion is allowed.
