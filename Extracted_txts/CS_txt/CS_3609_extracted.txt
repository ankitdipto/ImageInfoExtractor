Chapter 21 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets

When we use both union by rank and path compression, the worst-case running
time is O(m a(n)), where a(n) is a very slowly growing function, which we de-
fine in Section 21.4. In any conceivable application of a disjoint-set data structure,
a(n) < 4; thus, we can view the running time as linear in m in all practical situa-
tions. Strictly speaking, however, it is superlinear. In Section 21.4, we prove this
upper bound.

Exercises

21.3-1
Redo Exercise 21.2-2 using a disjoint-set forest with union by rank and path com-
pression.

213-2
Write a nonrecursive version of FIND-SET with path compression.

213-3

Give a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, 1 of which
are MAKE-SET operations, that takes Q(m 1gn) time when we use union by rank
only.

213-4

Suppose that we wish to add the operation PRINT-SET (x), which is given a node x
and prints all the members of x’s set, in any order. Show how we can add just
a single attribute to each node in a disjoint-set forest so that PRINT-SET(x) takes
time linear in the number of members of x’s set and the asymptotic running times
of the other operations are unchanged. Assume that we can print each member of
the set in O(1) time.

213-5 *

Show that any sequence of m MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, and LINK operations, where
all the LINK operations appear before any of the FIND-SET operations, takes only
O(m) time if we use both path compression and union by rank. What happens in
the same situation if we use only the path-compression heuristic?
