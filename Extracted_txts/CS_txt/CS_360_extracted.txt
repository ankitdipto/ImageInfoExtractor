Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Theorem 31.8 (Unique factorization)
There is exactly one way to write any composite integer a as a product of the form

a = PY Py Py
where the p; are prime, p; < p2 <--- < p;,and the e; are positive integers.
Proof We leave the proof as Exercise 31.1-11. .

As an example, the number 6000 is uniquely factored into primes as 2* - 3 - 53.

Exercises

311-1
Prove that ifa > b > Oandc =a +b,thenc moda = b.

31.1-2
Prove that there are infinitely many primes. (Hint: Show that none of the primes
Pi» Pa» +++ + Pk divide (pi p2+*+ Pk) + 1.)

31.1-3
Prove that if a | b and b | c, thena | c.

31.14
Prove that if p is prime and 0 <k < p, then ged(k, p) = 1.

311-5
Prove Corollary 31.5.

31.16
Prove that if p is prime and 0 < k < p, then p | (2). Conclude that for all integers
aand b and all primes p,

(a+b)? =a? +b? (mod p).

311-7

Prove that if a and b are any positive integers such that a | b, then
(x mod b) mod a = x mod a

for any x. Prove, under the same assumptions, that

xX =y (mod bd) implies x = y (mod a)

for any integers x and y.
