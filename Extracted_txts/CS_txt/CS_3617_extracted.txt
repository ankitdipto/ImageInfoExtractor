21.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression 579

is unchanged and iter(x) increases, then it increases by at least 1, and so
g(X) < bq1(x) = 1.

Finally, if the gth operation increases level(x), it increases by at least 1, so that
the value of the term (a(n) — level(x)) - x.rank drops by at least x.rank. Be-
cause level(x) increased, the value of iter(x) might drop, but according to the
bound (21.2), the drop is by at most x.rank — 1. Thus, the increase in poten-
tial due to the change in iter(x) is less than the decrease in potential due to the
change in level(x), and we conclude that $y (x) < $g—-1(x) — 1. .

Our final three lemmas show that the amortized cost of each MAKE-SET, LINK,
and FIND-SET operation is O(@(n)). Recall from equation (17.2) that the amor-
tized cost of each operation is its actual cost plus the increase in potential due to
the operation.

Lemma 21.11
The amortized cost of each MAKE-SET operation is O(1).

Proof Suppose that the qth operation is MAKE-SET(x). This operation creates
node x with rank 0, so that ¢,(x) = 0. No other ranks or potentials change, and
so ®, = ®,_;. Noting that the actual cost of the MAKE-SET operation is O(1)
completes the proof. .

Lemma 21.12
The amortized cost of each LINK operation is O(a(n)).

Proof Suppose that the th operation is LINK(x, y). The actual cost of the LINK
operation is O(1). Without loss of generality, suppose that the LINK makes y the
parent of x.

To determine the change in potential due to the LINK, we note that the only
nodes whose potentials may change are x, y, and the children of y just prior to the
operation. We shall show that the only node whose potential can increase due to
the LINK is y, and that its increase is at most @(1):

* By Lemma 21.10, any node that is y’s child just before the LINK cannot have
its potential increase due to the LINK.

* From the definition of ¢,(x), we see that, since x was a root just before the qth
operation, @g—1(x) = @(n)-x.rank. If x.rank = 0, then bg (x) = bg—1(x) = 0.
Otherwise,
gbg(X) < a@(n)+x.rank (by Corollary 21.9)

= dq-1(X).

and so x’s potential decreases.
