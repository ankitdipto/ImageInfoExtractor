Notes for Chapter 21 585

a. Argue that line 10 executes exactly once for each pair {u,v} € P.

b. Argue that at the time of the call LCA(w), the number of sets in the disjoint-set
data structure equals the depth of u in T.

c. Prove that LCA correctly prints the least common ancestor of u and v for each
pair {u,v} e P.

d. Analyze the running time of LCA, assuming that we use the implementation of
the disjoint-set data structure in Section 21.3.

 

Chapter notes

Many of the important results for disjoint-set data structures are due at least in part
to R. E. Tarjan. Using aggregate analysis, Tarjan [328, 330] gave the first tight
upper bound in terms of the very slowly growing inverse @(m,n) of Ackermann’s
function. (The function A,(j) given in Section 21.4 is similar to Ackermann’s
function, and the function @() is similar to the inverse. Both a(n) and @(m,n)
are at most 4 for all conceivable values of m and n.) An O(m1g* 1) upper bound
was proven earlier by Hopcroft and Ullman [5, 179]. The treatment in Section 21.4
is adapted from a later analysis by Tarjan [332], which is in turn based on an anal-
ysis by Kozen [220]. Harfst and Reingold [161] give a potential-based version of
Tarjan’s earlier bound.

Tarjan and van Leeuwen [333] discuss variants on the path-compression heuris-
tic, including “one-pass methods,” which sometimes offer better constant factors
in their performance than do two-pass methods. As with Tarjan’s earlier analyses
of the basic path-compression heuristic, the analyses by Tarjan and van Leeuwen
are aggregate. Harfst and Reingold [161] later showed how to make a small change
to the potential function to adapt their path-compression analysis to these one-pass
variants. Gabow and Tarjan [121] show that in certain applications, the disjoint-set
operations can be made to run in O(m) time.

Tarjan [329] showed that a lower bound of Q(m @(m,n)) time is required for
operations on any disjoint-set data structure satisfying certain technical conditions.
This lower bound was later generalized by Fredman and Saks [113], who showed
that in the worst case, Q(m &(m,n)) (lgn)-bit words of memory must be accessed.
