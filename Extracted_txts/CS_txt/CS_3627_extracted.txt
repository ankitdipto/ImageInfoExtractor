Part VI Graph Algorithms

When we characterize the running time of a graph algorithm on a given graph
G = (V,E), we usually measure the size of the input in terms of the number of
vertices |V| and the number of edges |E| of the graph. That is, we describe the
size of the input with two parameters, not just one. We adopt a common notational
convention for these parameters. Inside asymptotic notation (such as O-notation
or Q-notation), and only inside such notation, the symbol V denotes |V| and
the symbol E denotes |£|. For example, we might say, “the algorithm runs in
time O(VE),” meaning that the algorithm runs in time O(|V| |E|). This conven-
tion makes the running-time formulas easier to read, without risk of ambiguity.

Another convention we adopt appears in pseudocode. We denote the vertex set
of a graph G by G. V and its edge set by G.E. That is, the pseudocode views vertex
and edge sets as attributes of a graph.
