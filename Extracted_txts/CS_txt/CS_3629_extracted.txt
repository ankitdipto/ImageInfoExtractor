Figure 4.4 Stages in an A* search for Bucharest. Nodes are labelled with/= g+h. The h
values are the straight-line distances to Bucharest taken from Figure 4.1.

 

 

 

check, each time we generate a new node, to see if its/-cost is less than its parent’s f-cost; ifit
is, we use the parent’s f-cost instead:

f(r’) = max(f(n)gin’) + hin’)).

In this way, we ignore the misleading values that may occur with a nonmonotonic heuristic. This
equation is called the pathmax equation. Ifwe use it, then f will always be nondecreasing along
any path from the root, provided h is admissible.

The purpose of making this observation is to legitimize a certain picture of what A* does.
Aff never decreases along any path out from the root, we can conceptually draw contours in the
state space. Figure 4.5 shows an example. Inside the contour labelled 400, all nodes have f(n)
less than or equal to 400, and so on. Then, because A* expands the leafnode of lowest /, we can
see that an A* search fans out from the start node, adding nodes in concentric bands of increasing
f-cost.

With uniform-cost search (A* search using / = 0), the bands will be "circular" around the
start state. With more accurate heuristics, the bands will stretch toward the goal state and become
more narrowly focused around the optimal path. If we define f* to be the cost of the optimal
solution path, then we can say the following:

 

+ A* expands all nodes with f(n) < f*.
+ A* may then expand some of the nodes right on the "goal contour," for which f(n) =/*,
before selecting a goal node.

Intuitively, it is obvious that the first solution found must be the optimal one, because nodes in
all subsequent contours will have higher f-cost, and thus higher g-cost (because all goal states
have h(n) = 0). Intuitively, it is also obvious that A* search is complete. As we add bands of
