Figure 22.3. The operation of BFS on an undirected graph, Tree edges are shown shaded as they
are produced by BFS. The value of v.d appears within each vertex w. The queue Q is shown at the
beginning of each iteration of the while loop of lines 10-18. Vertex distances appear below vertices
in the queue.

Although we won’t use this loop invariant to prove correctness, it is easy to see
that it holds prior to the first iteration and that each iteration of the loop maintains
the invariant. Prior to the first iteration, the only gray vertex, and the only vertex
in Q, is the source vertex s. Line 11 determines the gray vertex u at the head of
the queue Q and removes it from Q. The for loop of lines 12-17 considers each
vertex v in the adjacency list of u. If v is white, then it has not yet been discovered,
and the procedure discovers it by executing lines 14-17. The procedure paints
vertex v gray, sets its distance v.d to u.d+1, records u as its parent v. 7, and places
it at the tail of the queue Q. Once the procedure has examined all the vertices on u’s
