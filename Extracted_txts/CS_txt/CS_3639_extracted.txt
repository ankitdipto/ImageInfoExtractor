Chapter 22. Elementary Graph Algorithms

Lemma 22.1
Let G = (V, E) be a directed or undirected graph, and let s € V be an arbitrary
vertex. Then, for any edge (u,v) € E,

5(s,v) < 5(s,u) +1.

Proof If u is reachable from s, then so is v. In this case, the shortest path from s
to v cannot be longer than the shortest path from s to u followed by the edge (u,v),
and thus the inequality holds. If w is not reachable from s, then 6(s, 1) = oo, and
the inequality holds. .

We want to show that BFS properly computes v.d = 4(s,v) for each ver-
tex v € V. We first show that v.d bounds 4(s, v) from above.

Lemma 22.2

Let G = (V, E) be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that BFS is run
on G from a given source vertex s € V. Then upon termination, for each ver-
tex v € V, the value v.d computed by BFS satisfies v.d > 8(s, v).

Proof We use induction on the number of ENQUEUE operations. Our inductive
hypothesis is that v.d > (s, v) for all v € V.

The basis of the induction is the situation immediately after enqueuing s in line 9
of BFS. The inductive hypothesis holds here, because s.d = 0 = 6(s,s) and
v.d = 00 = &(s, v) forall v € V — {s}.

For the inductive step, consider a white vertex v that is discovered during the
search from a vertex wu. The inductive hypothesis implies that u.d > 5(s,u). From
the assignment performed by line 15 and from Lemma 22.1, we obtain

vd = ud+l1

5(s,u) +1
5(s,v).

IV Iv

Vertex v is then enqueued, and it is never enqueued again because it is also grayed
and the then clause of lines 14-17 is executed only for white vertices. Thus, the
value of v.d never changes again, and the inductive hypothesis is maintained. =

To prove that v.d = 5(s, v), we must first show more precisely how the queue Q
operates during the course of BFS. The next lemma shows that at all times, the
queue holds at most two distinct d values.
