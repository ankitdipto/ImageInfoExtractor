(1, and the other for shift right (J,). When the selection input § = 0, the input
data are shifted right (down in the diagram). When $ = 1, the input data are
shifted left (up in the diagram), The function table in Fig. 4-12 shows which
input goes to each output after the shift. A shifter with m data inputs and
outputs requires n multiplexers. The two serial inputs can be controlled by
another multiplexer to provide the three possible types of shifts.

4-7 Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit

Instead of having individual registers performing the microoperatiéns directly,
computer systems employ a number of storage registers connected to a com-
ALU mon operational unit called an arithmetic logic unit, abbreviated ALU. To
