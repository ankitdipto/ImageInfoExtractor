Figure 22.4 The progress of the depth-first-search algorithm DFS on a directed graph. As edges
are explored by the algorithm, they are shown as either shaded (if they are tree edges) or dashed
(otherwise). Nontree edges are labeled B, C, or F according to whether they are back, cross, or
forward edges. Timestamps within vertices indicate discovery time/finishing times.

the root of a new tree in the depth-first forest. When DFS returns, every vertex u
has been assigned a discovery time u.d and a finishing time u.f.

In each call DFS-VisiT(G, u), vertex u is initially white. Line 1 increments
the global variable time, line 2 records the new value of time as the discovery
time u.d, and line 3 paints u gray. Lines 4-7 examine each vertex v adjacent to u
and recursively visit v if it is white. As each vertex v € Adj[u] is considered in
line 4, we say that edge (u,v) is explored by the depth-first search. Finally, after
every edge leaving u has been explored, lines 8—10 paint u black, increment time,
and record the finishing time in u.f.

Note that the results of depth-first search may depend upon the order in which
line 5 of DFS examines the vertices and upon the order in which line 4 of DFS-
VISIT visits the neighbors of a vertex. These different visitation orders tend not
