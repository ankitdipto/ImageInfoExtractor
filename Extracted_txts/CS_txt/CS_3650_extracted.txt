Figure 22.5 Properties of depth-first search. (a) The result of a depth-first search of a directed
graph. Vertices are timestamped and edge types are indicated as in Figure 22.4. (b) Intervals for
the discovery time and finishing time of each vertex correspond to the parenthesization shown. Each
rectangle spans the interval given by the discovery and finishing times of the corresponding vertex.
Only tree edges are shown. If two intervals overlap, then one is nested within the other, and the
vertex corresponding to the smaller interval is a descendant of the vertex corresponding to the larger.
(c) The graph of part (a) redrawn with all tree and forward edges going down within a depth-first tree

and all back edges going up from a descendant to an ancestor.
