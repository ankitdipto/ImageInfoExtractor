Chapter 22. Elementary Graph Algorithms

Proof We begin with the case in which u.d < v.d. We consider two subcases,
according to whether v.d < u.f or not. The first subcase occurs when v.d < u.f,
so v was discovered while u was still gray, which implies that v is a descendant
of u. Moreover, since v was discovered more recently than uv, all of its outgo-
ing edges are explored, and v is finished, before the search returns to and fin-
ishes u. In this case, therefore, the interval [v.d, v./] is entirely contained within
the interval [u.d,u.f]. In the other subcase, u.f < v.d, and by inequality (22.2),
u.d <u.f <v.d < vf; thus the intervals [u.d, u.f] and [v.d, v.f] are disjoint.
Because the intervals are disjoint, neither vertex was discovered while the other
was gray, and so neither vertex is a descendant of the other.

The case in which v.d < u.d is similar, with the roles of u and v reversed in the
above argument. .

Corollary 22.8 (Nesting of descendants’ intervals)
Vertex v is a proper descendant of vertex u in the depth-first forest for a (directed
or undirected) graph G if and only if u.d < v.d<v.f <uf.

Proof Immediate from Theorem 22.7. .

The next theorem gives another important characterization of when one vertex
is a descendant of another in the depth-first forest.

Theorem 22.9 (White-path theorem)

In a depth-first forest of a (directed or undirected) graph G = (V, E), vertex v is
a descendant of vertex u if and only if at the time u.d that the search discovers u,
there is a path from u to v consisting entirely of white vertices.

Proof =: If v = u, then the path from u to v contains just vertex u, which is still
white when we set the value of u.d. Now, suppose that v is a proper descendant
of u in the depth-first forest. By Corollary 22.8, u.d < v.d, and so v is white at
time u.d. Since v can be any descendant of u, all vertices on the unique simple
path from u to v in the depth-first forest are white at time u.d.

<=: Suppose that there is a path of white vertices from wu to v at time u.d, but v
does not become a descendant of u in the depth-first tree. Without loss of general-
ity, assume that every vertex other than v along the path becomes a descendant of wu.
(Otherwise, let v be the closest vertex to u along the path that doesn’t become a de-
scendant of u.) Let w be the predecessor of v in the path, so that w is a descendant
of u (w and u may in fact be the same vertex). By Corollary 22.8, w.f < u.f. Be-
cause v must be discovered after u is discovered, but before w is finished, we have
u.d < v.d < w.f < u.f. Theorem 22.7 then implies that the interval [v.d, v./]
