SECTIONGT Aridsuetic Logic Shift Unit 117

perform a microoperation, the contents of epecified registers are placed in the
inputs of the common ALU. The ALU perfurms an operation and the result of
the operation is then transferred to 2 destination register. The ALU is a
combinationa) circu) $0 that the entire register transfer operation from the
eource registers through the ALU and into the destination re gister can be
performed during one dock pulse period. The shift micreopesations are often
performed in a separate unit, but eometimes the shift unit is made part of the
overal) AWW.

The arithnetic, logic, and shift circuits introduced in previous sections
can be combined into one ALU with comunon selection variables. One stage
ofan arithmeticlogicshift unitis shown in Fig. 4-13. The subscn'pt i designates
a typical stage. Inputs Avand B, are applied to both the arithmetic and logic
