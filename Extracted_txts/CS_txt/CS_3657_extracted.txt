22.3 Depth-first search oll

 

Figure 22.6 A directed graph for use in Exercises 22.3-2 and 22.5-2.

22,3-3
Show the parenthesis structure of the depth-first search of Figure 22.4.

22.3-4

Show that using a single bit to store each vertex color suffices by arguing that
the DFS procedure would produce the same result if line 3 of DFS-VisIT was
removed.

22.3-5
Show that edge (u,v) is

a. atree edge or forward edge if and only if u.d < v.d<v.f<uf,
b. aback edge if and only if v.d <u.d <u.f <v.f, and

c. across edge if and only ifv.d <v.f <u.d<uf.

22.3-6

Show that in an undirected graph, classifying an edge (w, v) as a tree edge or a back
edge according to whether (1, v) or (v,u) is encountered first during the depth-first
search is equivalent to classifying it according to the ordering of the four types in
the classification scheme.

22.3-7
Rewrite the procedure DFS, using a stack to eliminate recursion.

22.3-8

Give a counterexample to the conjecture that if a directed graph G contains a path
from u to v, and if u.d < v.d ina depth-first search of G, then v is a descendant
of u in the depth-first forest produced.
