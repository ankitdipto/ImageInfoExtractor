118 cuarren sour Register Transfer and Microoperations

units. A particular microoperation is selected with inputs S; and So. A 4x 1
multiplexer at the output chooses between an arithmetic output in E; and a logic
output in H;, The data in the multiplexer are selected with inputs S; and S;.
The other two data inputs to the multiplexer receive inputs A,-1 for the
shift-right operation and A, , for theshift-leftoperation. Note that the diagram
shows just one typical stage. The circuit of Fig, 4-13 must be repeated n times
for an r-bit ALU. The output carry C, 1 of a given arithmetic stage must be
connected to the input carry C; of the next stage in sequence. The input carry
to the first stage is the input carry C,, which provides a selection variable for
the arithmetic operations.

The circuit whose one stage is specified in Fig. 4-13 provides eight arith-
metic operation, four logic operations, and two shift operations. Each opera-
tion is selected with the five variables $3, 52, Sy, So, and Ci The input carry Ci,
is used for selecting an arithmetic operation only.

Table 4-8 lists the 14 operations of the ALU. The first eight are arithmetic
operations (see Table 4-4) and are selected with SS; = 00. The next four are
logic operations (see Fig. 4-10) and are selected with S;S; = 01. The input carry
has no effect during the logic operations and is marked with don’t-care x’s.
The last two operations are shift operations and are selected with S382 = 10 and
11. The other three selection inputs have no effect on the shift.
