Problems for Chapter 22 621

22.5-6

Given a directed graph G = (V, £), explain how to create another graph G’ =
(V, E’) such that (a) G’ has the same strongly connected components as G, (b) G’
has the same component graph as G, and (c) E’ is as small as possible. Describe a
fast algorithm to compute G’.

22.5-7

Adirected graph G = (V, E) is semiconnected if, for all pairs of vertices u,v € V,
we have u ~+ v or v ~+ u. Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether
or not G is semiconnected. Prove that your algorithm is correct, and analyze its
running time.

22-1 Classifying edges by breadth-first search

A depth-first forest classifies the edges of a graph into tree, back, forward, and
cross edges. A breadth-first tree can also be used to classify the edges reachable
from the source of the search into the same four categories.

a. Prove that in a breadth-first search of an undirected graph, the following prop-
erties hold:

1. There are no back edges and no forward edges.

2. For each tree edge (u,v), we have v.d =u.d+ 1.
3. For each cross edge (u,v), we have v.d = u.d or v.d=u.d+1.

b. Prove that in a breadth-first search of a directed graph, the following properties
hold:
1. There are no forward edges.
2. For each tree edge (u,v), we have v.d =u.d +1.
3. For each cross edge (u,v), we have v.d <u.d +1.
4. For each back edge (u,v), we have 0 < v.d <u.d.

22-2 Articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components

Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph. An articulation point of G is
a vertex whose removal disconnects G. A bridge of G is an edge whose removal
disconnects G. A biconnected component of G is a maximal set of edges such
that any two edges in the set lie on a common simple cycle. Figure 22.10 illustrates
