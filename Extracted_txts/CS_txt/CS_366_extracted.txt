Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

EXTENDED-EUCLID returns not only d = a in line 2, but also the coefficients
xX = land y = 0, so that a = ax + by. If b ¢ 0, EXTENDED-EUCLID first
computes (d’, x’, y’) such that d’ = ged(b,a mod b) and

d' =bx'+(amodb)y’. (31.17)

As for EUCLID, we have in this case d = gced(a,b) = d' = gcd(b,a mod b).
To obtain x and y such that d = ax + by, we start by rewriting equation (31.17)
using the equation d = d’ and equation (3.8):

d = bx'+(a—b|a/b\)y'

= ay’ +d(x'—|a/b\ y’).
Thus, choosing x = y’ and y = x/— |a/b| y’ satisfies the equation d = ax +by,
proving the correctness of EXTENDED-EUCLID.

Since the number of recursive calls made in EUCLID is equal to the number
of recursive calls made in EXTENDED-EUCLID, the running times of EUCLID
and EXTENDED-EUCLID are the same, to within a constant factor. That is, for
a >b > 0, the number of recursive calls is O(lg b).
