Figure 22.10 The articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components of a connected, undi-
rected graph for use in Problem 22-2. The articulation points are the heavily shaded vertices, the
bridges are the heavily shaded edges, and the biconnected components are the edges in the shaded
regions, with a bec numbering shown.

these definitions. We can determine articulation points, bridges, and biconnected
components using depth-first search. Let Gz = (V. E,) be a depth-first tree of G.

a.

Prove that the root of G, is an articulation point of G if and only if it has at
least two children in G,.

Let v be a nonroot vertex of G,. Prove that v is an articulation point of G if and
only if v has a child s such that there is no back edge from s or any descendant
of s to a proper ancestor of v.

Let

vd,

v.low = min .
w.d : (u, w) is a back edge for some descendant u of v .

Show how to compute v./ow for all vertices v € V in O(£) time.

|, Show how to compute all articulation points in O(£) time.

Prove that an edge of G is a bridge if and only if it does not lie on any simple
cycle of G.

Show how to compute all the bridges of G in O(£) time.

. Prove that the biconnected components of G partition the nonbridge edges of G.

h. Give an O(E)-time algorithm to label each edge e of G with a positive in-

teger e.bcc such that e.bcc = e’.bcc if and only if e and e’ are in the same
biconnected component.
