PROBLEMS

 

 

 

‘Show theblock diagram of the hardware (similar to Fig 4-2a) that imple.
ments the following register transfer statement:

yz R2CR1, RIGRZ

‘The outputs of four registers, RO, R1, R2, and R3, are amnecteal through
44te-Lline multiplexers tothe inputs ofa Gith register, R5. Each register is
eight bits long. The equired transfers are dictated by four timing variables
Te through Ts a8 follows:

Te R5<RO
Te R5<R1
Ts R5eR2
Te R5CR3

‘The timing variables are mutually exchsive, which means that only one
varoble is equil to 1 atany given tine, while the other three are equal to
0. Draw 2 block diagram showing the hardware implementatian of the
register transfers. Include the cunnections sevsmary fur the four timing
variables to the selection inputs of the multiplerers and to the loadinput of
register R5.

 

Represent the following conditional control statement by two register trans-
fer statements with control functions.

If (P = 1) then (R1-R2) else if (Q = 1) then (R1eR3)

‘What has to be done to the bus system of Fig. 43 to be able to transfer
iedurmation from any segister to any olher register? Specifically, show the
connections that must be included to provide a path from the outputs of
register C to the inputs of register A.

‘Draw a diagram of a bus system similar to the one ahown in Fig. 4-3, but use
three-state buffers and a decoder instead of the multiplexers.

A digital computer hasa common bus system tor 16 registers 0f32 bitseach.
‘The bus fa constructed with multiplexes.

a. How many selection inputs are there in each multiplexer?

b. What size of multiplexers are needed?

¢. How many multiplexers are there in the bus?

‘The following transfer statements specify a memoty. Explain the memory
operation in each case.

a. R2—MLAR]

b. MIAR]—R3.
