23.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree 629

Corollary 23.2

Let G = (V, E) be acomnected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight func-
tion w defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum
spanning tree for G, and let C = (Vc, Ec) be aconnected component (tree) in the
forest G4 = (V, A). If (u, v) isa light edge connecting C to some other component
in Ga, then (u,v) is safe for A.

Proof The cut (Vc, V — Vc) respects A, and (u,v) is a light edge for this cut.
Therefore, (u,v) is safe for A. /.

Exercises

23.1-1
Let (u,v) be a minimum-weight edge in a connected graph G. Show that (7, v)
belongs to some minimum spanning tree of G.

23.1-2

Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 23.1. Let G =
(V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w de-
fined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning
tree for G, let (S, V — S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u,v) be a safe
edge for A crossing (S, V — S). Then, (u,v) is a light edge for the cut. Show that
the professor’s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.

23.1-3
Show that if an edge (u, v) is contained in some minimum spanning tree, then it is
a light edge crossing some cut of the graph.

23.1-4

Give a simple example of a connected graph such that the set of edges {(u.v) :
there exists a cut (S, V — S) such that (w, v) is a light edge crossing (S$, V — S)}
does not form a minimum spanning tree.

231-5

Let e be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of connected graph G = (V, E).
Prove that there is a minimum spanning tree of G’ = (V, E — {e}) that is also a
minimum spanning tree of G. That is, there is a minimum spanning tree of G that
does not include e.
