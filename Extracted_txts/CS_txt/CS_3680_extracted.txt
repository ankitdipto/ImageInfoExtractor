Chapter 23 Minimum Spanning Trees

23.1-6

Show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the
graph, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not
true by giving a counterexample.

23.1-7

Argue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that
connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example
to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be
nonpositive.

231-8

Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G, and let L be the sorted list of the
edge weights of T. Show that for any other minimum spanning tree T’ of G, the
list L is also the sorted list of edge weights of T’.

231-9
Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G = (V, E), and let V’ be a subset
of V. Let T’ be the subgraph of T induced by V’, and let G’ be the subgraph of G
induced by V’. Show that if T’ is connected, then T’ is a minimum spanning tree
of G’.

23.1-10

Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T, suppose that we decrease the
weight of one of the edges in T. Show that T is still a minimum spanning tree
for G. More formally, let T be a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights
given by weight function w. Choose one edge (x,y) € T anda positive number k,
and define the weight function w’ by

w(u.v) if(u.v) A (x.y).

wiv) = w(x,y)—k if (u,v) = (x,y).

Show that T is a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights given by w’.

231-11 x

Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T, suppose that we decrease the
weight of one of the edges not in T. Give an algorithm for finding the minimum
spanning tree in the modified graph.
