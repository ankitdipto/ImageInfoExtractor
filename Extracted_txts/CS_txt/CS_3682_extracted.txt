Figure 23.4 The execution of Kruskal’s algorithm on the graph from Figure 23.1, Shaded edges
belong to the forest A being grown. The algorithm considers each edge in sorted order by weight.
‘An arrow points to the edge under consideration at each step of the algorithm. If the edge joins two
distinct trees in the forest, it is added to the forest, thereby merging the two trees.

checks, for each edge (u,v), whether the endpoints u and v belong to the same
tree. If they do, then the edge (u,v) cannot be added to the forest without creating
a cycle, and the edge is discarded. Otherwise, the two vertices belong to different
trees. In this case, line 7 adds the edge (u,v) to A, and line 8 merges the vertices
in the two trees.
