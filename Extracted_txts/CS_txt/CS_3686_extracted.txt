23.2. The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim 635

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 23.5 The execution of Primâ€™s algorithm on the graph from Figure 23.1. The root vertex
is a. Shaded edges are in the tree being grown, and black vertices are in the tree. At each step of
the algorithm, the vertices in the tree determine a cut of the graph, and a light edge crossing the cut
is added to the tree. In the second step, for example, the algorithm has a choice of adding either
edge (b, c) or edge (a, h) to the tree since both are light edges crossing the cut.
