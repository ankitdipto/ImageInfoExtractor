Draw the block diagram for the hardware that implements the following
statements

xtyz: ARCAR +BR

where AR and BRaretwon-bit registers and x, y, and zarecontrol variables.
Indude the logic gates for the control function. (Remember that the sym-
bbol + designates an OR operation in a control or Boolean function but that
it represents an arithmetic plus in a microoperation.)

Show the hardware that implements the following statement. Include the
logicgates for the control function and a block diagram for the binary counter
with a count enable input.

Consider the following register transfer statements for two4-bit registers RL
and R2

xT: RICR1+R2
xT: R1GR2

Every time that variable T = 1, either the content of R2 is added to the
content of R1 ifx = 1, or the content of R2 is transferred to Rl ifx = 0. Draw
a diagram showing the hardwareimplementation of thetwostatements. Use
block diagrams for the two 4-bit registers, a 4-bit adder, and a quadruple
2-to-I-line multiplexer that selects the inputs to R1. In the diagram, show
how the control variables x and T select the inputs of the multiplexer and
the load input of register R1.

Using a 4-bit counter with parallel load as in Fig, 2-11 and a 4-bit adder as
inFig. 46, draw a block diagram that showshow to implement the following
statements:

x: RIGR1+R2 Add R2to RL
x’'y: RICRI+1 Increment RI

where R1 is a counter with parallel load and R2is a 4bit register.

‘The adder-subtractor circuit of Fig. 4-7 has the following values for input
mode M and data inputs A and B. In each case, determine the values of the
outputs 5, S:, 5, So, and Cy
