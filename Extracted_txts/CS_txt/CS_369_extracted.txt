Chess

Chess has received by far the largest share of attention in game playing. Although not meeting
the promise made by Simon in 1957 that within 10 years, computers would beat the human world
champion, they are now within reach of that goal. In speed chess, computers have defeated the
world champion, Gary Kasparov, In both 5-minute and 25-minute games, but in full tournament
games are only ranked among the top 100players worldwide at the time of writing. Figure 5.12
shows the ratings of human and computer champions over the years. It is tempting to try to
extrapolate and see where the lines will cross.

Progress beyond a mediocre level was initially very slow: some programs in the early
1970sbecame extremely complicated, with various kinds of tricks for eliminating some branches
of search, generating plausible moves, and so on, but the programs that won the ACM North
American Computer Chess Championships (initiated in 1970)tended to use straightforwardalpha-
beta search, augmented with book openings and infallible endgame algorithms. (This offers an
interesting example of how high performance requires a hybrid decision-making architecture to
implement the agent function.)

The first real jump in performance came not from better algorithms or evaluation functions,
but from hardware. Belle, the first special-purpose chess computer (Condon and Thompson,
1982), used custom integrated circuits to implement move generation and position evaluation,
enabling it to search several million positions to make a single move. Belle's rating was around
2250, on a scale where beginning humans are 1000 and the world champion around 2750; it
became the first master-level program.

The HITECH system, also a special-purpose computer, was designed by former world
correspondence champion Hans Berliner and his student Carl Ebeling to allow rapid calculation
of very sophisticated evaluation functions. Generating about 10 million positions per move
and using probably the most accurate evaluation of positions yet developed, HITECH became
