4. Inverses: For each a € S, there exists a unique element b € S, called the
inverse of a, such thata @b =b @a =e.

As an example, consider the familiar group (Z,+) of the integers Z under the
operation of addition: 0 is the identity, and the inverse of a is —a. Ifa group (S, ®)
satisfies the commutative law a @b = b @a foralla,b € S, then it is an abelian
group. If a group (S, @) satisfies |S| < 00, then it is a finite group.

The groups defined by modular addition and multiplication

We can form two finite abelian groups by using addition and multiplication mod-
ulo 1, where n is a positive integer. These groups are based on the equivalence
classes of the integers modulo n, defined in Section 31.1.

To define a group on Z,, we need to have suitable binary operations, which
we obtain by redefining the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication.
We can easily define addition and multiplication operations for Z,, because the
equivalence class of two integers uniquely determines the equivalence class of their
sum or product. That is, if@ =a’ (mod n) and b = b’ (mod n), then

a+b = a+b’ (modn),

ab = dab (mod n) .

Thus, we define addition and multiplication modulo n, denoted +,, and -,,, by

lan +n [Jn = [a+P]n (31.18)
[anon [Dn == [abn -

(We can define subtraction similarly on Z, by [a]n —n [b]n = [a — b]n, but divi-
sion is more complicated, as we shall see.) These facts justify the common and
convenient practice of using the smallest nonnegative element of each equivalence
class as its representative when performing computations in Z,. We add, subtract,
and multiply as usual on the representatives, but we replace each result x by the
representative of its class, that is, by x mod n.

Using this definition of addition modulo n, we define the additive group
modulo n as (Zn.+n). The size of the additive group modulo n is |Z,| = n.
Figure 31.2(a) gives the operation table for the group (Zs. +6).

Theorem 31.12
The system (Z,. +n) is a finite abelian group.

Proof Equation (31.18) shows that (Z,.+,,) is closed. Associativity and com-
mutativity of +,, follow from the associativity and commutativity of +:
