Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Theorem 31.14 (A nonempty closed subset of a finite group is a subgroup)
If (S, @) is a finite group and S’ is any nonempty subset of S such that a @b € S’
for all a,b € S’, then (S’, @) is a subgroup of (S, @).

Proof We leave the proof as Exercise 31.3-3. .

For example, the set {0,2,4, 6} forms a subgroup of Zg, since it is nonempty
and closed under the operation + (that is, it is closed under +).

The following theorem provides an extremely useful constraint on the size of a
subgroup; we omit the proof.

Theorem 31.15 (Lagrange’s theorem)
If (S, ®) is a finite group and (S’, @) is a subgroup of (S, @), then |S’| is a divisor
of |S|. /

A subgroup S’ of a group S is a proper subgroup if S’ # S. We shall use the
following corollary in our analysis in Section 31.8 of the Miller-Rabin primality
test procedure.

Corollary 31.16
If S’ is a proper subgroup of a finite group S, then |S’| < |S| /2. .

Subgroups generated by an element

Theorem 31.14 gives us an easy way to produce a subgroup of a finite group (S, @):
choose an element a and take all elements that can be generated from a using the
group operation. Specifically, define a for k > 1 by

k
a® =Q@Qa= aeae---ea

i=l

 

k
For example, if we take a = 2 in the group Ze, the sequence a) ,a a... is
2,4,0,2.4,0,2.4,0.....

In the group Z,, we have a® = ka mod n, and in the group Z*, we have aM =
a* mod n. We define the subgroup generated by a, denoted (a) or ((a), ®), by

(a) = {a sk >}.
We say that a generates the subgroup (a) or that a is a generator of (a). Since S is

finite, (a) is a finite subset of S, possibly including all of S. Since the associativity
of ® implies
