946 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Proof Lagrange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) implies that ord(a) | |S], and so
|S| =0 (mod ¢), where t = ord(a). Therefore, a") =q® =e, .

Draw the group operation tables for the groups (Z4, +4) and (Z,-s). Show that
these groups are isomorphic by exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence @ between
their elements such that a + b = c (mod 4) if and only if a(a) -a(b) = a(c)
(mod 5).

$(P) = (pl).

Show that for any integer n > 1 and for any a € Z*, the function f, : Z* > Z*
defined by fa(x) = ax mod n is a permutation of Z*.

 

31.4 Solving modular linear equations

We now consider the problem of finding solutions to the equation
ax =b (modn), (31.25)

where a > 0 andn > 0. This problem has several applications; for example,
we shall use it as part of the procedure for finding keys in the RSA public-key
cryptosystem in Section 31.7. We assume that a, b, and n are given, and we wish
to find all values of x, modulo n, that satisfy equation (31.25). The equation may
have zero, one, or more than one such solution.

Let (a) denote the subgroup of Z,, generated by a. Since (a) = {aM sx > 0} =
{ax mod n : x > O}, equation (31.25) has a solution if and only if [b] € (a). La-
grange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) tells us that |(a)| must be a divisor of n. The
following theorem gives us a precise characterization of (a).
