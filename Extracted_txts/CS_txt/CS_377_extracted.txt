Theorem 31.20
For any positive integers a and n, if d = gcd(a,n), then
(a) = (d) = {0,d,2d,...,((n/d) —1)d} (31.26)

in Z,, and thus

(a)| =n/d.

Proof We begin by showing that d € (a). Recall that EXTENDED-EUCLID (a, n)
produces integers x’ and y’ such that ax’ + ny’ = d. Thus, ax’ =d (mod n), so
that d € (a). In other words, d is a multiple of a in Zn.

Since d € (a), it follows that every multiple of d belongs to (a), because any
multiple of a multiple of a is itself a multiple of a. Thus, (a) contains every element
in {0,d,2d,..., ((n/d) — 1)d}. That is, (d) € (a).

We now show that (a) € (d). If m € (a), then m = ax modn for some
integer x, and som = ax + ny for some integer y. However, d | a and d | n, and
so d | m by equation (31.4). Therefore, m € (d).

Combining these results, we have that (a) = (d). To see that |(a)| = n/d,
observe that there are exactly n/d multiples of d between 0 and n—1, inclusive. =

Corollary 31.21
The equation ax = b (mod n) is solvable for the unknown x if and only if d | b,
where d = gcd(a,n).

Proof The equation ax = b (mod n) is solvable if and only if [b] € (a), which
is the same as saying

(b mod n) € {0,d.2d,....((n/d) — 1d}

by Theorem 31.20. If 0 < b <n, then b € (a) if and only if d | b, since the
members of (a) are precisely the multiples of d. If b < 0 or b > n, the corollary
then follows from the observation that d | b if and only if d | (b mod n), since b
and b mod n differ by a multiple of n, which is itself a multiple of d. /

Corollary 31.22
The equation ax = b (mod n) either has d distinct solutions modulo 1, where
d = gcd(a,n), or it has no solutions.

Proof If ax = b (mod n) has a solution, then b € (a). By Theorem 31.17,
ord(a) = |(a)|, and so Corollary 31.18 and Theorem 31.20 imply that the sequence
ai mod n, fori = 0, 1,..., is periodic with period | (a)| = n/d. If b € (a), then b
appears exactly d times in the sequence ai mod n, fori = 0,1,..., n —1, since
