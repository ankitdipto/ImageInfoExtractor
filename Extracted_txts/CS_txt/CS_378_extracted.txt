Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

the length-(n/d) block of values (a) repeats exactly d times as i increases from 0
to n—1. The indices x of the d positions for which ax mod n = bare the solutions
of the equation ax = b (mod n). .

Theorem 31.23

Let d = gced(a,n), and suppose that d = ax’ + ny’ for some integers x’ and y’
(for example, as computed by EXTENDED-EUCLID). If d | b, then the equation
ax = b (mod n) has as one of its solutions the value x, where

Xo = x/(b/d) modn.

Proof We have

axo = ax'(b/d) (modn)
d(b/d) (mod n) (because ax’ = d (mod n))

 

=b (mod 1) ,
and thus X9 is a solution toax = b (mod n). .
Theorem 31.24

Suppose that the equation ax = b (mod 7) is solvable (that is, d | b, where
d = gcd(a,n)) and that Xo is any solution to this equation. Then, this equa-
tion has exactly d distinct solutions, modulo n, given by x; = Xo + i(n/d) for
i=0,1,....,d-1.

Proof Because n/d > 0 and 0 < i(n/d) <n fori = 0,1,..., d —1, the
values X9.X1.-.+5 Xq_1 are all distinct, modulo 1. Since X9 is a solution of ax = b
(mod n), we have axo mod n = b (mod n). Thus, fori = 0,1,..., d—1, we
have

ax; modn a(x +in/d) mod n
(axo + ain/d) mod n

= axXo modn_ (because d | a implies that ain/d is a multiple of n)

=b (modn),
and hence ax; = b (mod n), making x; a solution, too. By Corollary 31.22, the
equation ax = b (mod n) has exactly d solutions, so that x9.%1..... Xq—1 must
be all of them. /

We have now developed the mathematics needed to solve the equation ax = b
(mod n); the following algorithm prints all solutions to this equation. The inputs
a and n are arbitrary positive integers, and b is an arbitrary integer.
