input and output devices. To demonstrate the most basic requirements for
input and output communication, we will use as an illustration a terminal unit
with a keyboard and printer. Input-output organization is dicsussed further in
Chap. 11.

Input—Output Configuration
The terminal sends and receives serial information. Each quantity of informa-
tion has eight bits of an alphanumeric code. The serial information from the
keyboardis shifted into the input register INPR. The serial information for the
printer isstored in the output register OUITR. These two registers communicate
with a communication interface serially and with the AC in parallel. The
input-output configuration is shown in Fig. 5-12. The transmitter interface re-
ceives serial information from the keyboard and transmits it to INPR. The re-
ceiver interface receives information from OUTR and sends it to the printer
serially. The operation of the serial communication interface is explained in
Sec. 11-3,

The input register INPR consists of eightbits and holds an alphanumeric
input information. The 1-bit input flag FGI is a control flip-flop. The flag bit is,
