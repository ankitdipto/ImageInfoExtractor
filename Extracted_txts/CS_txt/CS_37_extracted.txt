Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths

244-5

Show how to modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm slightly so that when we use it
to solve a system of difference constraints with m inequalities on n unknowns, the
running time is O(nm).

244-6

Suppose that in addition to a system of difference constraints, we want to handle
equality constraints of the form x; = Xx; + b,. Show how to adapt the Bellman-
Ford algorithm to solve this variety of constraint system.

244-7
Show how to solve a system of difference constraints by a Bellman-Ford-like algo-
rithm that runs on a constraint graph without the extra vertex vo.

244-8

Let Ax < b be a system of m difference constraints in n unknowns. Show that the
Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the corresponding constraint graph, maxi-
mizes )>/_, X; subject to Ax <b and x; < 0 for all xj.

244-9 x

Show that the Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the constraint graph for a sys-
tem Ax < b of difference constraints, minimizes the quantity (max {x; }—min {x; })
subject to Ax < b. Explain how this fact might come in handy if the algorithm is
used to schedule construction jobs.

24.4-10

Suppose that every row in the matrix A of a linear program Ax < b corresponds to
a difference constraint, a single-variable constraint of the form x; < bg, or a single-
variable constraint of the form —x; < by. Show how to adapt the Bellman-Ford
algorithm to solve this variety of constraint system.

244-11
Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system Ax < b of difference constraints
when all of the elements of b are real-valued and all of the unknowns x; must be
integers.

244-12 x

Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system Ax < b of difference constraints
when all of the elements of are real-valued and a specified subset of some, but
not necessarily all, of the unknowns x; must be integers.
