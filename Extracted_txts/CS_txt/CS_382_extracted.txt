Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Thanks to Corollary 31.26, we can use the notation a7! mod n to refer to the
multiplicative inverse of a, modulo n, when a and n are relatively prime. If
gced(a,n) = 1, then the unique solution to the equation ax = 1 (mod 7) is the
integer x returned by EXTENDED-EUCLID, since the equation

ged(a,n) =1 =ax+ny

implies ax = 1 (mod). Thus, we can compute a7! mod n efficiently using
EXTENDED-EUCLID.

Exercises

314-1
Find all solutions to the equation 35x = 10 (mod 50).

31.4-2

Prove that the equation ax = ay (mod n) implies x = y (mod n) whenever
ged(a,n) = 1. Show that the condition ged(a,n) = 1 is necessary by supplying a
counterexample with gcd(a,n) > 1.

31.4-3
Consider the following change to line 3 of the procedure MODULAR-LINEAR-
EQUATION-SOLVER:

3 Xo = x/(b/d) mod (n/d)
Will this work? Explain why or why not.

3144 x

Let p be prime and f(x) = fo + fix +--+: + fix" (mod p) be a polyno-
mial of degree ¢, with coefficients f; drawn from Zp. We say that a € Zp
is a zero of f if f(a) = 0 (mod p). Prove that if a is a zero of f, then
f(x) = (x —a)g(x) (mod p) for some polynomial g(x) of degree t — 1. Prove
by induction on ¢ that if p is prime, then a polynomial f(x) of degree t can have
at most f distinct zeros modulo p.

 

31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem

Around A.D. 100, the Chinese mathematician Sun-Tsii solved the problem of find-
ing those integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7
respectively. One such solution is x = 23; all solutions are of the form 23 + 105k
