31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem 951

for arbitrary integers k. The “Chinese remainder theorem” provides a correspon-
dence between a system of equations modulo a set of pairwise relatively prime
moduli (for example, 3, 5, and 7) and an equation modulo their product (for exam-
ple, 105).

The Chinese remainder theorem has two major applications. Let the inte-
ger n be factored as n = n,Nz---nx, where the factors nj; are pairwise relatively
prime. First, the Chinese remainder theorem is a descriptive “structure theorem”
that describes the structure of Z, as identical to that of the Cartesian product
Zn, X Zn, X +++ X Zp, with componentwise addition and multiplication modulo 1;
in the ith component. Second, this description helps us to design efficient algo-
rithms, since working in each of the systems Z,,, can be more efficient (in terms of
bit operations) than working modulo n.

Theorem 31.27 (Chinese remainder theorem)
Let n = 1,Mz-+--nx, where the n; are pairwise relatively prime. Consider the
correspondence

a (d1,42,..., ak). (31.27)
where a € Zn, a; € Zp,, and

a; =a mod n;

fori =1,2,..., k. Then, mapping (31.27) is a one-to-one correspondence (bijec-
tion) between Z,, and the Cartesian product Z,, x Zn, X-++ x Zn,,. Operations per-
formed on the elements of Z,, can be equivalently performed on the corresponding

k-tuples by performing the operations independently in each coordinate position in
the appropriate system. That is, if

 

a = (G1,42,..., ak).

b <> (bi.b2...., by).

then

(a+b) modn <= ((a,; +b1) mod m,..., (ae + b¢) mod ng) , (31.28)
(a—b)modn <= ((a;—b,) modny,..., (ax — be) mod ng) , (31.29)
(ab) mod n < (a,b; mod n,..., axby mod ng) . (31.30)

Proof Transforming between the two representations is fairly straightforward.
Going from a to (a;.d2..... dx) is quite easy and requires only k “mod” opera-
tions.

Computing a from inputs (a;.42.....d,) is a bit more complicated. We begin
by defining m; = n/n; fori = 1,2,...,k; thus m; is the product of all of the n;’s
other than nj: mj; = \N2-++Nj—1Nj 41 +++ Nz. We next define
