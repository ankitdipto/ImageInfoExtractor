Figure 31.3 An illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem for m1 = Sand nz = 13. For this
example, c = 26 and cz = 40. In row i, column j is shown the value of a, modulo 65, such
that @ mod 5 = i and a mod 13 = j. Note that row 0, column 0 contains a 0. Similarly, row 4,
column 12 contains a 64 (equivalent to â€”1). Since cy = 26, moving down a row increases a by 26.
Similarly, cy = 40 means that moving right by a column increases a by 40. Increasing a by 1
corresponds to moving diagonally downward and to the right, wrapping around from the bottom to
the top and from the right to the left.

As an example of the application of the Chinese remainder theorem, suppose we
are given the two equations

= 2 (mod 5),

= 3 (mod 13),
so thata,; = 2,m, = m2 = 5, da. = 3, andnz = m, = 13, and we wish
to compute a mod 65, since n = ninz = 65. Because 137! = 2 (mod 5) and
5"! =8 (mod 13), we have
c, = 13@Qmod5) = 26,

C2 = 5(8mod 13) = 40,
and
a = 2-26+3-40 (mod 65)
= 52+ 120 (mod 65)
= 2 (mod 65) .
See Figure 31.3 for an illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem, modulo 65.
Thus, we can work modulo n by working modulo n directly or by working in the

transformed representation using separate modulo n; computations, as convenient.
The computations are entirely equivalent.
