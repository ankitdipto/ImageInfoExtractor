31.5-2

Find all integers x that leave remainders 1,2, 3 when divided by 9, 8, 7 respectively.
315-3

Argue that, under the definitions of Theorem 31.27, if ged(a,n) = 1, then

(a~! modn) > ((a;' mod 7), (az! mod 2),..., (a,' mod nx)) .

315-4

Under the definitions of Theorem 31.27, prove that for any polynomial / , the num-
ber of roots of the equation f(x) = 0 (mod n) equals the product of the number
of roots of each of the equations f(x) = 0 (mod 7,), f(x) =0 (mod n),...,
F(x) =0 (mod nx).

 

31.6 Powers of an element

Just as we often consider the multiples of a given element a, modulo n, we consider
the sequence of powers of a, modulo n, where a € Z>:
aaa .a,..., (31.33)
modulo n. Indexing from 0, the Oth value in this sequence is a® modn = 1, and
the jth value is a’ mod n. For example, the powers of 3 modulo 7 are

i 0 12 3 45 67 8 9 10 I
3'mod7 1 3 264 5 13 26 4 ~=5
whereas the powers of 2 modulo 7 are

i 0 123 4 56 7 8 9 10 I
2mod7 1 2 4 12 4 12421 2 «4

In this section, let (a) denote the subgroup of Z* generated by a by repeated

multiplication, and let ord, (a) (the “order of a, modulo n”) denote the order of a
in Z*. For example, (2) = {1.2.4} in Z3, and ord7(2) = 3. Using the definition of
the Euler phi function ¢(n) as the size of Z* (see Section 31.3), we now translate

Corollary 31.19 into the notation of Z* to obtain Euler’s theorem and specialize it
to Z. where p is prime, to obtain Fermat’s theorem.
