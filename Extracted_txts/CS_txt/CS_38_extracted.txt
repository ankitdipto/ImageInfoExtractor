24.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties

Throughout this chapter, our correctness arguments have relied on the triangle
inequality, upper-bound property, no-path property, convergence property, path-
relaxation property, and predecessor-subgraph property. We stated these properties
without proof at the beginning of this chapter. In this section, we prove them.

The triangle inequality

In studying breadth-first search (Section 22.2), we proved as Lemma 22.1 a sim-
ple property of shortest distances in unweighted graphs. The triangle inequality
generalizes the property to weighted graphs.

Lemma 24.10 (Triangle inequality)
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E > R
and source vertex s. Then, for all edges (u,v) € E, we have

5(s,v) < 5(s,u) + w(u,v) «

Proof Suppose that p is a shortest path from source s to vertex v. Then p has
no more weight than any other path from s to v. Specifically, path p has no more
weight than the particular path that takes a shortest path from source s to vertex u
and then takes edge (u,v).

Exercise 24.5-3 asks you to handle the case in which there is no shortest path
from s to v. /

Effects of relaxation on shortest-path estimates

The next group of lemmas describes how shortest-path estimates are affected when
we execute a sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of a weighted, directed
graph that has been initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE.

Lemma 24.11 (Upper-bound property)

Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E > R.
Let s € V be the source vertex, and let the graph be initialized by INITIALIZE-
SINGLE-SOURCE(G,5). Then, v.d > 6(s,v) for all v € V, and this invariant is
maintained over any sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of G. Moreover,
once v.d achieves its lower bound 4(s, v), it never changes.
