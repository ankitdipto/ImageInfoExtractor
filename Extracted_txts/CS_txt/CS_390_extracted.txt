Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Maintenance: Let c’ and d’ denote the values of c and d at the end of an iteration
of the for loop, and thus the values prior to the next iteration. Each iteration
updates c’ = 2c (if b; = 0) orc’ = 2c +1 (if b; = 1), so that c will be correct
prior to the next iteration. If b; = 0, then d’ = d? modn = (a‘)? modn =
a? modn = a mod n. If b; = 1, then d’ = d?a mod n = (a‘)*a mod n =
a**! mod n = a mod n. In either case, d = a° mod n prior to the next
iteration.

Termination: At termination, i = —1. Thus, c = J, since c has the value of the
prefix (be. bg... .. bo) of b’s binary representation. Hence d = a° mod n =
a® mod n.

If the inputs a, b, and n are B-bit numbers, then the total number of arith-
metic operations required is O(8) and the total number of bit operations required

is O(B°).

31.7. The RSA public-key cryptosystem

With a public-key cryptosystem, we can encrypt messages sent between two com-
municating parties so that an eavesdropper who overhears the encrypted messages
will not be able to decode them. A public-key cryptosystem also enables a party
to append an unforgeable “digital signature” to the end of an electronic message.
Such a signature is the electronic version of a handwritten signature on a paper doc-
ument. It can be easily checked by anyone, forged by no one, yet loses its validity
if any bit of the message is altered. It therefore provides authentication of both the
identity of the signer and the contents of the signed message. It is the perfect tool
