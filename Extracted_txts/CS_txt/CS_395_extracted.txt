Figure 31.6 Digital signatures in a public-key system. Alice signs the message M’ by appending
her digital signature 0 = S4(M’) to it. She transmits the message/signature pair (M’,o) to Bob,
who verifies it by checking the equation M’ = P4(c). If the equation holds, he accepts (M‘, 0) as
a message that Alice has signed.

+ Alice sends the message/signature pair (M‘,o) to Bob.

* When Bob receives (M’,o), he can verify that it originated from Alice by us-
ing Alice’s public key to verify the equation M’ = P4(o). (Presumably, M’
contains Alice’s name, so Bob knows whose public key to use.) If the equation
holds, then Bob concludes that the message M’ was actually signed by Alice.
If the equation fails to hold, Bob concludes either that the message M’ or the
digital signature o was corrupted by transmission errors or that the pair (M’.o)
is an attempted forgery.

Because a digital signature provides both authentication of the signer’s identity and
authentication of the contents of the signed message, it is analogous to a handwrit-
ten signature at the end of a written document.

A digital signature must be verifiable by anyone who has access to the signer’s
public key. A signed message can be verified by one party and then passed on to
other parties who can also verify the signature. For example, the message might
be an electronic check from Alice to Bob. After Bob verifies Alice’s signature on
the check, he can give the check to his bank, who can then also verify the signature
and effect the appropriate funds transfer.

A signed message is not necessarily encrypted; the message can be “in the clear”
and not protected from disclosure. By composing the above protocols for encryp-
tion and for signatures, we can create messages that are both signed and encrypted.
The signer first appends his or her digital signature to the message and then en-
crypts the resulting message/signature pair with the public key of the intended re-
cipient. The recipient decrypts the received message with his or her secret key to
obtain both the original message and its digital signature. The recipient can then
verify the signature using the public key of the signer. The corresponding com-
bined process using paper-based systems would be to sign the paper document and
