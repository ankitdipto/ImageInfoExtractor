Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

At this point, we briefly present an alternative description of the behavior of
WITNESS as a function of the sequence X¥ = (xo, X1.....X+), which we shall find
useful later on, when we analyze the efficiency of the Miller-Rabin primality test.
Note that if x; = 1 for some 0 < i < ft, WITNESS might not compute the rest
of the sequence. If it were to do so, however, each value X;+1,Xj+2,.....X; would
be 1, and we consider these positions in the sequence X as being all 1s. We have
four cases:

1. X = (...,d), where d # 1: the sequence X does not end in 1. Return TRUE
in line 8; a is a witness to the compositeness of n (by Fermat’s Theorem).

 

2. X = (1,1,...,1): the sequence X is all 1s. Return FALSE; is not a witness
to the compositeness of n.
3. X =(...,—I,1,...,1): the sequence X ends in 1, and the last non-1 is equal

to —1. Return FALSE; @ is not a witness to the compositeness of 1.

4. X =(....d,1,...,1), where d # +1: the sequence X ends in 1, but the last
non-| is not —1. Return TRUE in line 6; a is a witness to the compositeness
of n, since d is a nontrivial square root of 1.

 

We now examine the Miller-Rabin primality test based on the use of WITNESS.
Again, we assume that 71 is an odd integer greater than 2.

4 return COMPOSITE // definitely

5 return PRIME 7 almost surely

The procedure MILLER-RABIN is a probabilistic search for a proof that n is
composite. The main loop (beginning on line 1) picks up to s random values of a
from Z;* (line 2). If one of the a’s picked is a witness to the compositeness of n,
then MILLER-RABIN returns COMPOSITE on line 4. Such a result is always cor-
rect, by the correctness of WITNESS. If MILLER-RABIN finds no witness in 5
trials, then the procedure assumes that this is because no witnesses exist, and there-
fore it assumes that 7 is prime. We shall see that this result is likely to be correct
if s is large enough, but that there is still a tiny chance that the procedure may be
unlucky in its choice of a’s and that witnesses do exist even though none has been
found.

To illustrate the operation of MILLER-RABIN, let n be the Carmichael num-
ber 561, so thatn —1 = 560 = 2+.35,¢ = 4, and u = 35. If the pro-
cedure chooses a = 7 as a base, Figure 31.4 in Section 31.6 shows that WIT-
NESS computes x9 = a°° = 241 (mod 561) and thus computes the sequence
