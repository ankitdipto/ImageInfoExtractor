31.8  Primality testing 971

X = (241, 298, 166, 67, 1). Thus, WITNEss discovers a nontrivial square root
of 1 in the last squaring step, since a?8° = 67 (mod n) and a* = 1 (mod n).
Therefore, a = 7 is a witness to the compositeness of n, WITNESS(7,7) returns
TRUE, and MILLER-RABIN returns COMPOSITE.

If n is a B-bit number, MILLER-RABIN requires O(sf) arithmetic operations
and O(sB*) bit operations, since it requires asymptotically no more work than s
modular exponentiations.

Error rate of the Miller-Rabin primality test

If MILLER-RABIN returns PRIME, then there is a very slim chance that it has made
an error. Unlike PSEUDOPRIME, however, the chance of error does not depend
on 7; there are no bad inputs for this procedure. Rather, it depends on the size of s
and the “luck of the draw” in choosing base values a. Moreover, since each test is
more stringent than a simple check of equation (31.40), we can expect on general
principles that the error rate should be small for randomly chosen integers n. The
following theorem presents a more precise argument.

Theorem 31.38
If n is an odd composite number, then the number of witnesses to the composite-
ness of 77 is at least (n — 1)/2.

Proof The proof shows that the number of nonwitnesses is at most (n — 1)/2,
which implies the theorem.

We start by claiming that any nonwitness must be a member of Z*. Why?
Consider any nonwitness a. It must satisfy a”~! = 1 (mod n) or, equivalently,
a-a" = 1 (modn). Thus, the equation ax = 1 (mod 7) has a solution,
namely a"-?. By Corollary 31.21, ged(a,n) | 1, which in turn implies that
ged(a,n) = 1. Therefore, a is a member of Z*; all nonwitnesses belong to Z.

To complete the proof, we show that not only are all nonwitnesses contained
in Z>, they are all contained in a proper subgroup B of Z* (recall that we say B
is a proper subgroup of Z* when B is subgroup of Z* but B is not equal to Z*).
By Corollary 31.16, we then have |B| < |Z*|/2. Since |Z*| < n — 1, we obtain
|B| < (n — 1)/2. Therefore, the number of nonwitnesses is at most (n — 1)/2, so
that the number of witnesses must be at least (n — 1)/2.

We now show how to find a proper subgroup B of Z* containing all of the
nonwitnesses. We break the proof into two cases.

Case 1: There exists an x € Z* such that

x"! £1 (modn).
