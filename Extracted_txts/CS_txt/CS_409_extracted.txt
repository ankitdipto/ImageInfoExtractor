31.8  Primality testing 973

Acceptable pairs certainly exist since u is odd; we can choose v = n — | and
j = 0,so that (n—1, 0) is an acceptable pair. Now pick the largest possible j such
that there exists an acceptable pair (v, j), and fix v so that (v, j) is an acceptable
pair. Let
Ba={xeZ*:x?™"=+1 (modn)}.
Since B is closed under multiplication modulo n, it is a subgroup of Z*. By Theo-
rem 31.15, therefore, |B| divides |Z*|. Every nonwitness must be a member of B,
since the sequence X produced by a nonwitness must either be all 1s or else contain
a—I1 no later than the j th position, by the maximality of j. (If (a, j’) is acceptable,
where a is a nonwitness, we must have j’ < j by how we chose j.)

We now use the existence of v to demonstrate that there exists aw € Z* — B,
and hence that B is a proper subgroup of Z*. Since v?’“ = —1 (mod ), we have

v?/" = —] (mod 1) by Corollary 31.29 to the Chinese remainder theorem. By
Corollary 31.28, there exists a w simultaneously satisfying the equations

w = v (mod),

w = 1 (modn).

Therefore,

w?" = —1 (mod).

ww?" = 1 (mod ny).

By Corollary 31.29, w?” # 1 (mod) implies w?’“ #4 1 (mod n), and
w?’" # —1 (mod n>) implies w?”" # —1 (mod). Hence, we conclude that
w?’" £+1 (mod 7), and sow ¢ B.

It remains to show that w € Z*, which we do by first working separately mod-
ulo 7; and modulo nz. Working modulo n,, we observe that since v € Z*, we
have that gced(v,n) = 1, and so also ged(v,m1) = 1; if v does not have any com-
mon divisors with 71, then it certainly does not have any common divisors with 71.
Since w =v (mod 7), we see that ged(w,m1) = 1. Working modulo m2, we
observe that w = 1 (mod m2) implies gcd(w,n2) = 1. To combine these results,
we use Theorem 31.6, which implies that gcd(w,min2) = gcd(w,n) = 1. That is,
we Zr.

Therefore w € Z* — B, and we finish case 2 with the conclusion that B is a
proper subgroup of Z>.

In either case, we see that the number of witnesses to the compositeness of 11 is
at least (n — 1)/2. .

 

Theorem 31.39
For any odd integer n > 2 and positive integer s, the probability that MILLER-
RABIN(, 5) errs is at most 2%.
