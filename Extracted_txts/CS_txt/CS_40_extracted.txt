24.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties 673

some vertices u,v € V. Suppose that G is initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-
SouRcE(G,s) and then a sequence of relaxation steps that includes the call
RELAX(u,v, w) is executed on the edges of G. If u.d = 6(s,u) at any time
prior to the call, then v.d = 6(s, v) at all times after the call.

Proof By the upper-bound property, if u.d = 5(s,u) at some point prior to re-
laxing edge (u,v), then this equality holds thereafter. In particular, after relaxing
edge (u,v), we have

vd < u.d+w(u,v) (by Lemma 24.13)
= 6(s,u) + w(u,v)
= 6(s,v) (by Lemma 24.1) .

By the upper-bound property, v.d > 6(s,v), from which we conclude that
v.d = 6(s,v), and this equality is maintained thereafter. /

Lemma 24.15 (Path-relaxation property)

Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E > R,
and let s € V be a source vertex. Consider any shortest path p = (vo. V1..... Ve)
from 5 = Vo to vg. If G is initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s) and
then a sequence of relaxation steps occurs that includes, in order, relaxing the edges
(V0. V1), (V1, V2), (Ve-1, Ve), then vg.d = S(s, vg) after these relaxations and
at all times afterward. This property holds no matter what other edge relaxations
occur, including relaxations that are intermixed with relaxations of the edges of p.

Proof We show by induction that after the ith edge of path p is relaxed, we have
v;.d = 6(s, v;). For the basis, i = 0, and before any edges of p have been relaxed,
we have from the initialization that vo.d = s.d = 0 = 6(s,s). By the upper-bound
property, the value of s.d never changes after initialization.

For the inductive step, we assume that vj-1.d = 6(s,v;-1), and we examine
what happens when we relax edge (v;-1,v;). By the convergence property, after
relaxing this edge, we have v;.d = 6(s,v;), and this equality is maintained at all
times thereafter. 7

Relaxation and shortest-paths trees

We now show that once a sequence of relaxations has caused the shortest-path es-
timates to converge to shortest-path weights, the predecessor subgraph G, induced
by the resulting 7 values is a shortest-paths tree for G. We start with the follow-
ing lemma, which shows that the predecessor subgraph always forms a rooted tree
whose root is the source.
