Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Proof Using Theorem 31.38, we see that if is composite, then each execution of
the for loop of lines 1-4 has a probability of at least 1/2 of discovering a witness x
to the compositeness of 1. MILLER-RABIN makes an error only if it is so unlucky
as to miss discovering a witness to the compositeness of 1 on each of the s iterations
of the main loop. The probability of such a sequence of misses is at most 2~*. sm

If n is prime, MILLER-RABIN always reports PRIME, and if 1 is composite, the
chance that MILLER-RABIN reports PRIME is at most 2°.

When applying MILLER-RABIN to a large randomly chosen integer 7, however,
we need to consider as well the prior probability that 1 is prime, in order to cor-
rectly interpret MILLER-RABIN’s result. Suppose that we fix a bit length 6 and
choose at random an integer 7 of length f bits to be tested for primality. Let A
denote the event that ” is prime. By the prime number theorem (Theorem 31.37),
the probability that 1 is prime is approximately

Pr{A} = 1/Inn
1.443/B .

Now let B denote the event that MILLER-RABIN returns PRIME. We have that
Pr {B | A} = 0 (or equivalently, that Pr{B | A} = 1) and Pr{B | A} < 2° (or
equivalently, that Pr {B | A} > 1-27‘).

But what is Pr{A | B}, the probability that n is prime, given that MILLER-
RABIN has returned PRIME? By the alternate form of Bayes’s theorem (equa-
tion (C.18)) we have

v

Pr{A}Pr{B | A}
Pr {A} Pr{B | A} + Pr {A} Pr {B | A}
1
1+42%(Inn—1)°
This probability does not exceed 1/2 until s exceeds lg(Inn — 1). Intuitively, that
many initial trials are needed just for the confidence derived from failing to find a
witness to the compositeness of n to overcome the prior bias in favor of n being
composite. For a number with 6 = 1024 bits, this initial testing requires about
Ig(Inn — 1) Ig(B/1.443)
x 9

Pr{A| B} =

v

trials. In any case, choosing s = 50 should suffice for almost any imaginable
application.

In fact, the situation is much better. If we are trying to find large primes by
applying MILLER-RABIN to large randomly chosen odd integers, then choosing
a small value of s (say 3) is very unlikely to lead to erroneous results, though
