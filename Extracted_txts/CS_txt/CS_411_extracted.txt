31.9 Integer factorization 975

Wwe won't prove it here. The reason is that for a randomly chosen odd composite
integer n, the expected number of nonwitnesses to the compositeness of 1 is likely
to be very much smaller than (n — 1)/2.

If the integer 7 is not chosen randomly, however, the best that can be proven is
that the number of nonwitnesses is at most (n — 1)/4, using an improved version
of Theorem 31.38. Furthermore, there do exist integers n for which the number of
nonwitnesses is (n — 1)/4.

Exercises

31.8-1
Prove that if an odd integer 7 > 1 is not a prime or a prime power, then there exists
a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n.

318-2 x
It is possible to strengthen Euler’s theorem slightly to the form

a*”) = 1 (mod n) foralla € Z* ,
where n = pi! +++ p& and A(n) is defined by
An) = lem($(p{'),--- (Dy) » (31.42)

Prove that A(n) | ¢(n). A composite number 7 is a Carmichael number if
A(n) |n—1. The smallest Carmichael number is 561 = 3. 11 - 17; here,
A(n) = Iem(2, 10,16) = 80, which divides 560. Prove that Carmichael num-
bers must be both “square-free” (not divisible by the square of any prime) and the
product of at least three primes. (For this reason, they are not very common.)

31.8-3
Prove that if x is a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, then ged(x — 1,n) and
ged(x + 1,7) are both nontrivial divisors of n.

 

* 31.9 Integer factorization

Suppose we have an integer 1 that we wish to factor, that is, to decompose into a
product of primes. The primality test of the preceding section may tell us that 7 is
composite, but it does not tell us the prime factors of n. Factoring a large integer n
seems to be much more difficult than simply determining whether n is prime or
composite. Even with today’s supercomputers and the best algorithms to date, we
cannot feasibly factor an arbitrary 1024-bit number.
