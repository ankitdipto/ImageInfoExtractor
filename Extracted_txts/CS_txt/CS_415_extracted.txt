Figure 31.7  Pollard’s rho heuristic. (a) The values produced by the recurrence xj41 =
(x? — 1) mod 1387, starting with x1 = 2. The prime factorization of 1387 is 19-73. The heavy
arrows indicate the iteration steps that are executed before the factor 19 is discovered. The light
arrows point to unreached values in the iteration, to illustrate the “rho” shape. The shaded values are
the y values stored by POLLARD-RHO. The factor 19 is discovered upon reaching x7 = 177, when
gced(63 — 177, 1387) = 19 is computed. The first x value that would be repeated is 1186, but the
factor 19 is discovered before this value is repeated. (b) The values produced by the same recurrence,
modulo 19. Every value x; given in part (a) is equivalent, modulo 19, to the value x/ shown here.
For example, both x4 = 63 and x7 = 177 are equivalent to 6, modulo 19. (c) The values produced
by the same recurrence, modulo 73. Every value x; given in part (a) is equivalent, modulo 73, to the
value x!” shown here. By the Chinese remainder theorem, each node in part (a) corresponds to a pair
‘of nodes, one from part (b) and one from part (c).

The sequence (x;) induces a corresponding sequence (x/) modulo p, where

Xx; = x; mod p

for all i.
Furthermore, because f,, is defined using only arithmetic operations (squaring
and subtraction) modulo 1, we can compute x;,, from xj; the “modulo p” view of
