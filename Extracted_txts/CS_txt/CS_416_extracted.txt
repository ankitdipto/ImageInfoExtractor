Figure 5-13 Flowchart for interrupt eyele.

The way that the interrupt is handled by the computer can be explained
by means of the flowchart of Fig. 5-13. An interrupt flip-flop R is included in
the computer. When R = 0, the computer goes through an instruction cycle.
During the execute phase of the instruction cycle IEN is checked by the control.
If it is 0, it indicates that the programmer does not want to use the interrupt,
so control continues with the next instruction cycle. If JEN is 1, control checks
the flag bits. If both flags are 0, it indicates that neither the input nor the output
registers are ready for transfer of information. In this case, control continues
with the next instruction cycle. If either flag is set to 1 while IEN = 1, flip-flop
Ris set to 1. At the end of the execute phase, control checks the value of R,
andifitis equal to 1, it goes toan interrupt cycle instead of an instruction cycle.

The interrupt cycle is a hardware implementation of a branch and save
return address operation. The return address available in PC is stored in a
specific location where it can be found later when the program returns to the
instruction at which it was interrupted. This location may be a processor
