982 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

c. Show how to compute F;, in O(lg7) time using only integer addition and mul-
tiplication. (Hint: Consider the matrix

O01

and its powers.)

d,. Assume now that adding two B-bit numbers takes ©(8) time and that multi-
plying two f-bit numbers takes ©(A) time. What is the running time of these
three methods under this more reasonable cost measure for the elementary arith-
metic operations?

31-4 Quadratic residues
Let p be an odd prime. A number a € Z> is a quadratic residue if the equation
x? =a (mod p) has a solution for the unknown x.

a. Show that there are exactly (p — 1)/2 quadratic residues, modulo p.

b. If p is prime, we define the Legendre symbol (9), fora € Z*, tobe 1 ifaisa
quadratic residue modulo p and —1 otherwise. Prove that ifa € Z>, then

(5) =a? (mod p).

Give an efficient algorithm that determines whether a given number a is a qua-
dratic residue modulo p. Analyze the efficiency of your algorithm.

c. Prove that if p is a prime of the form 4k + 3 and a is a quadratic residue in Z*,
then a**! mod p is a square root of a, modulo p. How much time is required
to find the square root of a quadratic residue a modulo p?

d. Describe an efficient randomized algorithm for finding a nonquadratic residue,
modulo an arbitrary prime p, that is, a member of Z} that is not a quadratic
residue. How many arithmetic operations does your algorithm require on aver-
age?

 

Chapter notes

Niven and Zuckerman [265] provide an excellent introduction to elementary num-
ber theory. Knuth [210] contains a good discussion of algorithms for finding the
