Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms

Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest [143] present a digital-signature scheme for which
every conceivable type of forgery is provably as difficult as factoring. Menezes,
van Oorschot, and Vanstone [254] provide an overview of applied cryptography.

The rho heuristic for integer factorization was invented by Pollard [277]. The
version presented here is a variant proposed by Brent [56].

The best algorithms for factoring large numbers have a running time that grows
roughly exponentially with the cube root of the length of the number 7 to be fac-
tored. The general number-field sieve factoring algorithm (as developed by Buh-
ler, Lenstra, and Pomerance [57] as an extension of the ideas in the number-field
sieve factoring algorithm by Pollard [278] and Lenstra et al. [232] and refined by
Coppersmith [77] and others) is perhaps the most efficient such algorithm in gen-
eral for large inputs. Although it is difficult to give a rigorous analysis of this
algorithm, under reasonable assumptions we can derive a running-time estimate of
L(1/3,n) #92420), where L(a,n) = e(inn)*(In inn)!

The elliptic-curve method due to Lenstra [233] may be more effective for some
inputs than the number-field sieve method, since, like Pollard’s rho method, it can
find a small prime factor p quite quickly. With this method, the time to find p is
estimated to be L(1/2, p)¥2+2.
