24.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties 675

 

Figure 24.9 Showing that a simple path in Gz from source s to vertex v is unique. If there are two
paths py (s ~+ u~+ xX > Z~> v)and pp (s+ u~+ y +z ~ v), where x # y, then Z.7 =x
and z. = y, a contradiction.

But

since each vertex in the cycle c appears exactly once in each summation. This
equality implies

i=l

Thus, the sum of weights around the cycle c is negative, which provides the desired
contradiction.

We have now proven that G,, is a directed, acyclic graph. To show that it forms
a rooted tree with root s, it suffices (see Exercise B.5-2) to prove that for each
vertex v € V,,, there is a unique simple path from s to v in G,.

We first must show that a path from s exists for each vertex in V,. The ver-
tices in V, are those with non-NIL z values, plus s. The idea here is to prove by
induction that a path exists from s to all vertices in Vz. We leave the details as
Exercise 24.5-6.

To complete the proof of the lemma, we must now show that for any vertex
v € V,, the graph G, contains at most one simple path from s to v. Suppose other-
wise. That is, suppose that, as Figure 24.9 illustrates, G, contains two simple paths
from s to some vertex v: p1, Which we decompose into s~+u~+ x + Z~ 0,
and pz, which we decompose into s ~+ u~+ y > z~+ v, where x # y (though u
could be s and z could be v). But then, z.2 = x and z.m = y, which implies
the contradiction that x = y. We conclude that G, contains a unique simple path
from s to v, and thus G,, forms a rooted tree with root s. .

We can now show that if, after we have performed a sequence of relaxation steps,
all vertices have been assigned their true shortest-path weights, then the predeces-
sor subgraph G,, is a shortest-paths tree.
