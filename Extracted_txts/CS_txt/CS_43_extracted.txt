Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths

Lemma 24.17 (Predecessor-subgraph property)

Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E > R,
let s € V be a source vertex, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles
that are reachable from s. Let us call INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, 5) and then
execute any sequence of relaxation steps on edges of G that produces v.d = 6(s,v)
for all v € V. Then, the predecessor subgraph G, is a shortest-paths tree rooted
at s.

Proof We must prove that the three properties of shortest-paths trees given on
page 647 hold for G,. To show the first property, we must show that V,, is the set
of vertices reachable from s. By definition, a shortest-path weight 5(s, v) is finite
if and only if v is reachable from s, and thus the vertices that are reachable from s
are exactly those with finite d values. But a vertex v € V — {s} has been assigned
a finite value for v.d if and only if v.2 # NIL. Thus, the vertices in V,, are exactly
those reachable from s.

The second property follows directly from Lemma 24.16.

It remains, therefore, to prove the last property of shortest-paths trees: for each
vertex v € V,,, the unique simple path s 2. vy in Gz is a shortest path from s to v
in G. Let p = (v0, V1. ..-. vg), Where V9 = s and yy = v. Fori = 1,2,..., k,
we have both v;.d = 4(s,v;) and vj.d > vj-1.d + w(v;-1, v;), from which we
conclude w(vj-1,v;) < 6(s,v;) — 5(s, vj-1). Summing the weights along path p
yields

= 8(s, v%) — 6(s, vo) (because the sum telescopes)
= 4(s, ve) (because 6(s, vo) = 5(s,s) = 0) .
Thus, w(p) < 5(s, vz). Since 5(s, vz) is a lower bound on the weight of any path

from s to vg, we conclude that w(p) = 4(s, vg), and thus p is a shortest path
from s tov = vx. .
