Chapter 5. Game Playing

 

The first two computer chess programs to play a match against each other were the Kotok-
McCarthy program and the “ITEP” program written at Moscow's Institute of Theoretical and
Experimental Physics (Adelson-Velsky et al., 1970). This intercontinental match was played by
telegraph. It ended in 1967 with a 3-1 victory for the ITEP program. The first ACM North
American Computer Chess Championship tournament was held in New York City in 1970. The
first World Computer Chess Championship was held in 1974 in Stockholm (Hayes and Levy,
1976). It was won by Kaissa (Adelson-Velsky ef al., 1975), another program from ITEP.

A later version of Greenblatt's MacHack 6 was the first chess program to run on custom
hardware designed specifically for chess (Moussouris et a/., 1979), but the firstprogram to achieve
notable success through the use of custom hardware was Belle (Condon and Thompson, 1982).
Most of the strongest recent programs, such as HITECH (Ebeling, 1987; Berliner and Ebeling,
1989) and Deep Thought (Hsu et a/., 1990) have run on custom hardware. Major exceptions
are Cray Blitz (Hyatt ef a/., 1986), which runs on a general-purpose Cray supercomputer, and
Socrates II, winner of the 23rd ACM North American Computer Chess Championship in 1993,
which runs on an Intel 486-based microcomputer. It should be noted that Deep Thought was not
there to defend its title. Deep Thought 2 regained the championship in 1994. It should also be
noted that even custom-hardware machines can benefit greatly from improvements purely at the
software level (Berliner, 1989).

The Fredkin Prize, established in 1980, offered $5000 to the first program to achieve a
Master rating, $10,000 to the first program to achieve a USCF (United States Chess Federation)
rating of 2500 (near the grandmaster level), and $100,000 for the first program to defeat the
human world champion. The $5000 prize was claimed by Belle in 1983, and the $10,000 prize
by Deep Thought in 1989. The $100,000 prize remains unclaimed, in view of convincing wins
in extended play by world champion Gary Kasparov over Deep Thought (Hsu ef al., 1990).

The literature for computer chess is far better developed than for any other game played
by computer programs. Aside from the tournaments already mentioned, the rather misleadingly
named conference proceedings Heuristic Programming in Artificial Intelligence report on the
Computer Chess Olympiads. The International Computer Chess Association (ICCA), founded
in 1977, publishes the quarterly JCC4 Journal. Important papers have been published in the
numbered serial anthology Advances in Computer Chess, starting with (Clarke, 1977). Some
early general AI textbooks (Nilsson, 1971; Slagle, 1971) include extensive material on game-
playing programs, including chess programs. David Levy’s Computer Chess Compendium (Levy,
1988a) anthologizes many of the most important historical papers in the field, together with the
scores of important games played by computer programs. The edited volume by Marsland and
Schaeffer (1990) contains interesting historical and theoretical papers on chess and Go along
with descriptions of Cray Blitz, HITECH, and Deep Thought. Several important papers on chess,
along with material on almost all games for which computer game-playing programs have been
written (including checkers, backgammon, Go, Othello, and several card games) can be found in
Levy (1988b). There is even a textbook on how to write a computer game-playing program, by
one of the major figures in computer chess (Levy, 1983).

The expectimax algorithm described in the text was proposed by Donald Michie (1966),
although of course it follows directly from the principles of game-tree evaluation due to Von
Neumann and Morgenstern. Bruce Ballard (1983) extended alpha-beta pruning to cover trees
with chance nodes. The backgammon program BKG (Berliner, 1977; Berliner, 1980b) was
