Figure 33.1 (a) The cross product of vectors p1 and p2 is the signed area of the parallelogram.
(b) The lightly shaded region contains vectors that are clockwise from p. The darkly shaded region
contains vectors that are counterclockwise from p.

Cross products

Computing cross products lies at the heart of our line-segment methods. Consider
vectors p; and p, shown in Figure 33.1(a). We can interpret the cross product
P1 X P2 as the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the points (0,0), Pi, P2,
and p; + p2 = (X; + X2. ¥1 +2). An equivalent, but more useful, definition gives
the cross product as the determinant of a matrix:!

X, X2
x = det
Pi X P2 ( yr ye )

= Xiy2-*2V1

—pP2X* pPi-

If p1 X p2 is positive, then p, is clockwise from p2 with respect to the origin (0, 0);
if this cross product is negative, then p; is counterclockwise from p2. (See Exer-
cise 33.1-1.) Figure 33.1(b) shows the clockwise and counterclockwise regions
relative to a vector p. A boundary condition arises if the cross product is 0; in this
case, the vectors are colinear, pointing in either the same or opposite directions.
To determine whether a directed segment Pop is closer to a directed seg-
ment Po P> ina clockwise direction or in a counterclockwise direction with respect
to their common endpoint po, we simply translate to use po as the origin. That
is, we let p; — po denote the vector p, = (x}.¥{), Where x} = x1; — Xo and
Y, = Yi—Yo, and we define p2— po similarly. We then compute the cross product

 

' actually, the cross product is a three-dimensional concept. It is a vector that is perpendicular to
both p1 and p2 according to the “right-hand rule” and whose magnitude is [21 y2 —x2)1|. In this
chapter, however, we find it convenient to treat the cross product simply as the value x1 y2 — x21.
