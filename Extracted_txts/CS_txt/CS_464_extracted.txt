Figure 33.2 Using the cross product to determine how consecutive line segments DoPy and Drpr
turn at point p1. We check whether the directed segment D973 is clockwise or counterclockwise
relative to the directed segment POPT- (a) If counterclockwise, the points make a left turn. (b) If
clockwise, they make a right turn.

(Pi — Po) X (P2 = Po) = (%1 — Xo) (V2 = Yo) — (2 = X0)(V1 — Yo) -

If this cross product is positive, then PoP is clockwise from PoP>; if negative, it
is counterclockwise.

Determining whether consecutive segments turn left or right

Our next question is whether two consecutive line segments PoP and Py Pz turn
left or right at point p;. Equivalently, we want a method to determine which way a
given angle Z po P1 P2 turns. Cross products allow us to answer this question with-
out computing the angle. As Figure 33.2 shows, we simply check whether directed
segment PoP? is clockwise or counterclockwise relative to directed segment Po Pi-
To do so, we compute the cross product (p2 — po) x (pi — po). If the sign of
this cross product is negative, then Do P> is counterclockwise with respect to PoP1,
and thus we make a left turn at p;. A positive cross product indicates a clockwise
orientation and a right turn. A cross product of 0 means that points po, Pi, and p2
are colinear.

Determining whether two line segments intersect

To determine whether two line segments intersect, we check whether each segment
straddles the line containing the other. A segment P;P> straddles a line if point p;
lies on one side of the line and point p lies on the other side. A boundary case
arises if p; Or P2 lies directly on the line. Two line segments intersect if and only
if either (or both) of the following conditions holds:

1. Each segment straddles the line containing the other.

2. An endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment. (This condition comes
from the boundary case.)
