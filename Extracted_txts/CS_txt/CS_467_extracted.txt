Figure 33.3 Cases in the procedure SEGMENTS-INTERSECT. (a) The segments Py pz and P3p4
straddle each other’s lines. Because P3pq straddles the line containing PyPa, the signs of the cross
products (p3 — p1) x (p2 — p1) and (p4— p1) x (p2 — p1) differ. Because P7Pa straddles the line
containing D3pq, the signs of the cross products (p1 — p3) x (pa — p3) and (p2 — p3) x (pa — p3)
differ. (b) Segment D377 straddles the line containing Drps, but PrPs does not straddle the line
containing P3pq. The signs of the cross products (p1 — p3) x (p4— p3) and (p2 — p3) x (pa— p3)
are the same. (c) Point p3 is colinear with Pypz and is between py and py. (d) Point p3 is colinear
with Py Pa, but it is not between p; and pz. The segments do not intersect.

 

 

each other’s lines, although a boundary case may apply. If all the relative orienta-
tions are nonzero, no boundary case applies. All the tests against 0 in lines 7-13
then fail, and SEGMENTS-INTERSECT returns FALSE in line 15. Figure 33.3(b)
shows this case.

A boundary case occurs if any relative orientation dx is 0. Here, we know that px
is colinear with the other segment. It is directly on the other segment if and only
if it is between the endpoints of the other segment. The procedure ON-SEGMENT
returns whether px is between the endpoints of segment };P;, which will be the
other segment when called in lines 7-13; the procedure assumes that px is colinear
with segment Pj Pj. Figures 33.3(c) and (d) show cases with colinear points. In
Figure 33.3(c), p3 is on Py Pz, and so SEGMENTS-INTERSECT returns TRUE in
line 12. No endpoints are on other segments in Figure 33.3(d), and so SEGMENTS-
INTERSECT returns FALSE in line 15.
