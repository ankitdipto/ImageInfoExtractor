146 Chapter 5. Game Playing

 

54 The algorithms described in this chapter construct a search tree for each move from scratch.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages ofretaining the search tree from one move to the next
and extending the appropriate portion. How would tree retention interact with the use of selective
search to examine "useful" branches of the tree?

55 Develop a formal proof of â€˜correctness of alpha-beta pruning. To do this, consider the
situation shown in Figure 5.14. The question is whether to prune node n;, which is a max-node
and a descendant of node n,. The basic idea is to prune it if and only ifthe minimax value of ny
can be shown to be independent of the value of 7;.

a. The value ofn\ is given by
my = min(n2,121,...,726,)

By writing a similar expression for the value of 12. find an expression for m\ in terms of nj.
b. Let /; be the minimum (or maximum) of the node values to the left of node n; at depth 7.
These are the nodes whose minimax value is already known. Similarly, let 7; be the
minimum (or maximum) of the node values to the right of; at depth i, These nodes have
not yet been explored. Rewrite your expression for m\ in terms of the /; and 7; values.
c. Now reformulate the expression to show that in order to affect n), n; must not exceed a
certain bound derived from the /; values.

d. Repeat the process for the case where nj; is a min-node.
You might want to consult Wand (1980), who shows how the alpha-beta algorithm can be auto-

matically synthesized from the minimax algorithm, using some general program-transformation
techniques.
