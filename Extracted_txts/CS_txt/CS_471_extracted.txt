Chapter 33 Computational Geometry

the exercises at the end of this section show, this algorithm, or simple variations of
it, can help solve other computational-geometry problems.

The algorithm runs in O(n 1gn) time, where n is the number of segments we are
given. It determines only whether or not any intersection exists; it does not print
all the intersections. (By Exercise 33.2-1, it takes Q(n7) time in the worst case to
find all the intersections in a set of n line segments.)

In sweeping, an imaginary vertical sweep line passes through the given set of
geometric objects, usually from left to right. We treat the spatial dimension that
the sweep line moves across, in this case the x-dimension, as a dimension of
time. Sweeping provides a method for ordering geometric objects, usually by plac-
ing them into a dynamic data structure, and for taking advantage of relationships
among them. The line-segment-intersection algorithm in this section considers all
the line-segment endpoints in left-to-right order and checks for an intersection each
time it encounters an endpoint.

To describe and prove correct our algorithm for determining whether any two
of n line segments intersect, we shall make two simplifying assumptions. First, we
assume that no input segment is vertical. Second, we assume that no three input
segments intersect at a single point. Exercises 33.2-8 and 33.2-9 ask you to show
that the algorithm is robust enough that it needs only a slight modification to work
even when these assumptions do not hold. Indeed, removing such simplifying
assumptions and dealing with boundary conditions often present the most difficult
challenges when programming computational-geometry algorithms and proving
their correctness.

Ordering segments

Because we assume that there are no vertical segments, we know that any input
segment intersecting a given vertical sweep line intersects it at a single point. Thus,
we can order the segments that intersect a vertical sweep line according to the y-
coordinates of the points of intersection.

To be more precise, consider two segments 5, and s>. We say that these segments
are comparable at x if the vertical sweep line with x-coordinate x intersects both of
them. We say that 5, is above sy at x, written 5; x 52, if s; and sy are comparable
at x and the intersection of s; with the sweep line at x is higher than the intersection
of s) with the same sweep line, or if s; and s, intersect at the sweep line. In
Figure 33.4(a), for example, we have the relationships a =, c,a =; b,b =; ¢,
a >, c,andb , c. Segment d is not comparable with any other segment.

For any given x, the relation “>,” is a total preorder (see Section B.2) for all
segments that intersect the sweep line at x. That is, the relation is transitive, and
if segments 5; and Ss each intersect the sweep line at x, then either 5; = y 52
or Sy =x 51, or both (if s; and s2 intersect at the sweep line). (The relation >, is
