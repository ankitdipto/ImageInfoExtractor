Figure 33.5 The execution of ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT. Each dashed line is the sweep line at
an event point. Except for the rightmost sweep line, the ordering of segment names below each sweep
line corresponds to the total preorder T at the end of the for loop processing the corresponding event
point. The rightmost sweep line occurs when processing the right endpoint of segment c; because
segments d and b surround c and intersect each other, the procedure returns TRUE.

Correctness

To show that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT is correct, we will prove that the call
ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT(S) returns TRUE if and only if there is an intersec-
tion among the segments in S.

It is easy to see that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT returns TRUE (on lines 7
and 10) only if it finds an intersection between two of the input segments. Hence,
if it retuns TRUE, there is an intersection.

We also need to show the converse: that if there is an intersection, then ANY-
SEGMENTS-INTERSECT returns TRUE. Let us suppose that there is at least one
intersection. Let p be the leftmost intersection point, breaking ties by choosing the
point with the lowest y-coordinate, and let a and b be the segments that intersect
at p. Since no intersections occur to the left of p, the order given by T is correct at
all points to the left of p. Because no three segments intersect at the same point, a
and b become consecutive in the total preorder at some sweep line z.? Moreover,
Z is to the left of p or goes through p. Some segment endpoint g on sweep line z

 

7 If we allow three segments to intersect at the same point, there may be an intervening segment c that
intersects both a and b at point p. That is, we may have a >w ¢ and ¢ > b forall sweep lines w to
the left of p for which a = b. Exercise 33.2-8 asks you to show that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT
is correct even if three segments do intersect at the same point.
