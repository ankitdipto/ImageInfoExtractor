33.3 Finding the convex hull 1029

33.2-8
Argue that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT works correctly even if three or more
segments intersect at the same point.

33.2-9

Show that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT works correctly in the presence of verti-
cal segments if we treat the bottom endpoint of a vertical segment as if it were a
left endpoint and the top endpoint as if it were a right endpoint. How does your
answer to Exercise 33.2-2 change if we allow vertical segments?

 

33.3 Finding the convex hull

The convex hull of a set Q of points, denoted by CH(Q), is the smallest convex
polygon P for which each point in Q is either on the boundary of P or in its
interior. (See Exercise 33.1-5 for a precise definition of a convex polygon.) We
implicitly assume that all points in the set Q are unique and that Q contains at
least three points which are not colinear. Intuitively, we can think of each point
in Q as being a nail sticking out from a board. The convex hull is then the shape
formed by a tight rubber band that surrounds all the nails. Figure 33.6 shows a set
of points and its convex hull.

In this section, we shall present two algorithms that compute the convex hull
of a set of n points. Both algorithms output the vertices of the convex hull in
counterclockwise order. The first, known as Graham’s scan, runs in O(n 1g 77) time.
The second, called Jarvis’s march, runs in O(nh) time, where / is the number of
vertices of the convex hull. As Figure 33.6 illustrates, every vertex of CH(Q) is a
