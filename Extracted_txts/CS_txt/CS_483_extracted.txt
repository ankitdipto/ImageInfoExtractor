Figure 33.7 The execution of GRAHAM-SCAN on the set Q of Figure 33.6. The current convex
hull contained in stack S is shown in gray at each step. (a) The sequence (1, p2,- -., P12) of points
numbered in order of increasing polar angle relative to po, and the initial stack S containing po, p1,
and p2. (b)}-(k) Stack S after each iteration of the for loop of lines 7-10. Dashed lines show nonleft
turns, which cause points to be popped from the stack. In part (h), for example, the right turn at
angle Zp7 pg Po causes pg to be popped, and then the right turn at angle Zp6 p7 po causes p7 to be
popped.
