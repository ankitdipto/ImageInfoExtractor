The next vertex, p1, has the smallest polar angle of any point with respect to po. Then, pz has the
smallest polar angle with respect to p1. The right chain goes as high as the highest point p3. Then,
we construct the left chain by finding smallest polar angles with respect to the negative x-axis.

Jarvis’s march

Jarvis’s march computes the convex hull of a set Q of points by a technique known
as package wrapping (or gift wrapping). The algorithm runs in time O(n/h),
where / is the number of vertices of CH(Q). When hi is o(Ig 1), Jarvis’s march is
asymptotically faster than Graham’s scan.

Intuitively, Jarvis’s march simulates wrapping a taut piece of paper around the
set QO. We start by taping the end of the paper to the lowest point in the set, that is,
to the same point po with which we start Graham’s scan. We know that this point
must be a vertex of the convex hull. We pull the paper to the right to make it taut,
and then we pull it higher until it touches a point. This point must also be a vertex
of the convex hull. Keeping the paper taut, we continue in this way around the set
of vertices until we come back to our original point po.

More formally, Jarvis’s march builds a sequence H = (po. P1.....Ph—1) of the
vertices of CH(Q). We start with po. As Figure 33.9 shows, the next vertex p;
in the convex hull has the smallest polar angle with respect to po. (In case of ties,
we choose the point farthest from po.) Similarly, p2 has the smallest polar angle
