Chapter 33 Computational Geometry

33.4-3

We can define the distance between two points in ways other than euclidean. In
the plane, the L,,-distance between points p; and p2 is given by the expres-
sion (jx; —X2\" + |y1 — yl), Euclidean distance, therefore, is L2-distance.
Modify the closest-pair algorithm to use the Lj-distance, which is also known as
the Manhattan distance.

33.44

Given two points p; and p2 in the plane, the L..-distance between them is
given by max(|x1 — X2|.|1 — Y2|). Modify the closest-pair algorithm to use the
Lo-distance.

33.4-5

Suppose that Q(7) of the points given to the closest-pair algorithm are covertical.
Show how to determine the sets Pz, and Pr and how to determine whether each
point of Y is in Py; or Pe so that the running time for the closest-pair algorithm
remains O(n lgn).

33.4-6

Suggest a change to the closest-pair algorithm that avoids presorting the Y array
but leaves the running time as O(n lg). (Hint: Merge sorted arrays Y; and Yr to
form the sorted array Y .)

 

Problems

33-1 Convex layers

Given a set Q of points in the plane, we define the convex layers of Q inductively.
The first convex layer of Q consists of those points in Q that are vertices of CH(Q).
Fori > 1, define Q; to consist of the points of Q with all points in convex layers
1,2,..., i —1 removed. Then, the ith convex layer of Q is CH(Q;) if Q; A 9 and
is undefined otherwise.

a. Give an O(n7)-time algorithm to find the convex layers of a set of n points.

b. Prove that Q(n lg n) time is required to compute the convex layers of a set of 1
points with any model of computation that requires Q(n lg) time to sort n real
numbers.
