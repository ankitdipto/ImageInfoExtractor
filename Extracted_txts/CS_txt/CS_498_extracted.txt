33-2. Maximal layers
Let Q be a set of m points in the plane. We say that point (x, y) dominates
point (x’, y’) if x > x’ and y > y’. A point in Q that is dominated by no other
points in Q is said to be maximal. Note that Q may contain many maximal points,
which can be organized into maximal layers as follows. The first maximal layer L;
is the set of maximal points of Q. Fori > 1, the ith maximal layer L; is the set of
maximal points in @ — Uj) Lj.

Suppose that Q has k nonempty maximal layers, and let y; be the y-coordinate
of the leftmost point in L; fori = 1,2,..., k. For now, assume that no two points
in Q have the same x- or y-coordinate.

a. Show that y, > y2 > +++ > Ve.

Consider a point (x, y) that is to the left of any point in Q and for which y is
distinct from the y-coordinate of any point in Q. Let O’ = QU {(x, y)}.

b. Let j be the minimum index such that y; < y, unless y < yg, in which case
we let j = k + 1. Show that the maximal layers of Q' are as follows:

+ If j <k, then the maximal layers of Q’ are the same as the maximal layers
of Q, except that L; also includes (x, y) as its new leftmost point.

* If j =k +1, then the first k maximal layers of Q’ are the same as for Q, but
in addition, Q’ has a nonempty (k + 1)st maximal layer: Ly4, = {(x, y)}.

c. Describe an O(n lgn)-time algorithm to compute the maximal layers of a set 0
of n points. (Hint: Move a sweep line from right to left.)

d. Do any difficulties arise if we now allow input points to have the same x- or
y-coordinate? Suggest a way to resolve such problems.

33-3 Ghostbusters and ghosts
A group of n Ghostbusters is battling n ghosts. Each Ghostbuster carries a proton
pack, which shoots a stream at a ghost, eradicating it. A stream goes in a straight
line and terminates when it hits the ghost. The Ghostbusters decide upon the fol-
lowing strategy. They will pair off with the ghosts, forming n Ghostbuster-ghost
pairs, and then simultaneously each Ghostbuster will shoot a stream at his cho-
sen ghost. As we all know, it is very dangerous to let streams cross, and so the
Ghostbusters must choose pairings for which no streams will cross.

Assume that the position of each Ghostbuster and each ghost is a fixed point in
the plane and that no three positions are colinear.

a. Argue that there exists a line passing through one Ghostbuster and one ghost
such that the number of Ghostbusters on one side of the line equals the number
of ghosts on the same side. Describe how to find such a line in O(n 1g) time.
