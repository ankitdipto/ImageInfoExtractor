 

Part III

KNOWLEDGE AND REASONING

 

 

 

In Part II, we showed that an agent that has goals and searches for solutions to
the goals can do better than one that just reacts to its environment. We focused
mainly on the question of how to carry out the search, leaving aside the question
of general methods for describing states and actions.

In this part, we extend the capabilities of our agents by endowing them with
the capacity for general logical reasoning. A logical, knowledge-based agent
begins with some knowledge of the world and of its own actions. It uses logical
Teasoning to maintain a description of the world as new percepts arrive, and to
deduce a course of action that will achieve its goals.

In Chapter 6, we introduce the basic design for a knowledge-based agent.
We then present a simple logical language for expressing knowledge, and show
how it can be used to draw conclusions about the world and to decide what to
do. In Chapter 7, we augment the language to make it capable of expressing a
wide variety of knowledge about complex worlds. In Chapter 8, we exercise this
capability by expressing a significant fragment ofcommonsense knowledge about
the real world, including time, change, objects, categories, events, substances,
and of course money. In Chapters 9 and 10 we discuss the theory and practice of
computer systems for logical reasoning.
