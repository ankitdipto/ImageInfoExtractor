the bus and the content of the bus is transferred into AR by enabling its LD
control input. The fourth statement clears AR to 0. The last statement incre-
ments AR by 1. The control functions can be combined into three Boolean
expressions as follows:

 

where LD(AR) is the load input of AR, CLR(AR) is the clear input of AR, and
INR(AR) is the increment input of AR. The control gate logicassociated with
AR is shown in Fig. 5-16.

Ina similar fashion we can derive the control gates for the other registers
aswell as the logic needed to control the read and write inputs of memory. The
logic gates associated with the read input of memory is derived by scanning
Table 5-6 to find the statements that specify a read operation. The read oper-
ation is recognized from the symbol — M[AR].

Read = R’T, + Dsl, + (Dp + Dy + Dr + DT

The output of the logic gates that implement the Boolean expression above
must be connected to the read input of memory.
