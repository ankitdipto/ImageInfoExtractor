Problems for Chapter 24 681

Let * = ming 4(c), where c ranges over all directed cycles in G. We call acycle c
for which jx(c) = j* a minimum mean-weight cycle. This problem investigates
an efficient algorithm for computing j1*.

Assume without loss of generality that every vertex v € V is reachable from a
source vertex s € V. Let 5(s, v) be the weight of a shortest path from s to v, and let
5x(s, v) be the weight of a shortest path from s to v consisting of exactly k edges.
If there is no path from s to v with exactly k edges, then 6,(s,v) = 00.

a. Show that if j4* = 0, then G contains no negative-weight cycles and 5(s,v) =
ming<ken—1 5¢(S, v) for all vertices v € V.

b. Show that if 4* = 0, then

5n(S.¥) — 8x (5,V)
max §=_————_——_. >
Osk<n-1 n—-k

0

for all vertices v € V. (Hint: Use both properties from part (a).)

c. Let c be a 0-weight cycle, and let u and v be any two vertices on c. Suppose
that j4* = 0 and that the weight of the simple path from u to v along the cycle
is x. Prove that 6(s,v) = 5(s,u) + x. (Hint: The weight of the simple path
from v to u along the cycle is —x.)

d. Show that if j.* = 0, then on each minimum mean-weight cycle there exists a
vertex v such that

5n(5,V) — 5 (5, v)
max ————__"~ =
Osk<n-1 n—-k

0.

(Hint: Show how to extend a shortest path to any vertex on a minimum mean-
weight cycle along the cycle to make a shortest path to the next vertex on the
cycle.)

e. Show that if .* = 0, then

. Sn (8.¥) — dk (5. ¥)
mn max = ———— =
veV 0<k<n-1 n—k

0.

f. Show that if we add a constant f to the weight of each edge of G, then jx*
increases by f. Use this fact to show that

«a Sn (8, v) = ks, v)
= TEP ocken-1 n—k ,

g. Give an O(VE)-time algorithm to compute j*.
