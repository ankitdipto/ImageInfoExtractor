Control of Single Flip-flops

The control gates for the seven flip-flops can be determined in a similar
manner. For example, Table 5-6 shows that IEN may change as a result of the
two instructions ION and IOF.

pB: IEN@1
pBs: IEN<-0

where p = D,IT; and B, and B,are bits 7 and 6 of IR, respectively. Moreover,
at the end of the interrupt cycle IEN is cleared to 0.

RTz IEN<O

If we use a JK flip-flip for IEN, the control gate logic will be as shown in
Fig. 5-17.

Control of Common Bus

The 16-bit common bus shown in Fig, 5-4 is controlled by the selection inputs
Sz, Sy, and So, The decimal number shown with each bus input specifies the
equivalent binary number that must be applied to the selectioninputs inorder
to select the corres ponding register. Table 5-7 specifies the binary numbers for
5,5;S9 that select each register. Each binary number is associated with a Boolean
variable x; through %, corresponding to the gate structure that must be active
in order to select the register or memory forthe bus, For example, when x; = 1,
the value of $,5,SÂ» must be 001 and the output of AR will be selected for the
bus. Table 5-7 is recognized as the truth table of a binary encoder. The place-
ment of the encoder at the inputs of the bus selection logic is shown in Fig.
5-18. The Boolean functions for the encoder are

Sy =a + x4 x5 +37
Samat y+ xt x7
Sp = Aq t xs + xg +,
