Any such graph is nonhamiltonian.

containing all the vertices.’ The dodecahedron is hamiltonian, and Figure 34.2(a)
shows one hamiltonian cycle. Not all graphs are hamiltonian, however. For ex-
ample, Figure 34.2(b) shows a bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices.
Exercise 34.2-2 asks you to show that all such graphs are nonhamiltonian.

We can define the hamiltonian-cycle problem, “Does a graph G have a hamil-
tonian cycle?” as a formal language:

HAM-CYCLE = {(G) : G is a hamiltonian graph} .

How might an algorithm decide the language HAM-CYCLE? Given a problem
instance (G), one possible decision algorithm lists all permutations of the vertices
of G and then checks each permutation to see if it is a hamiltonian path. What is
the running time of this algorithm? If we use the “reasonable” encoding of a graph
as its adjacency matrix, the number m of vertices in the graph is Q(,/7), where
n = |(G)| is the length of the encoding of G. There are m! possible permutations

 

7In a letter dated 17 October 1856 to his friend John T. Graves, Hamilton [157, p. 624] wrote, “I
have found that some young persons have been much amused by trying a new mathematical game
which the Icosion furnishes, one person sticking five pins in any five consecutive points ...and the
other player then aiming to insert, which by the theory in this letter can always be done, fifteen other
pins, in cyclical succession, so as to cover all the other points, and to end in immediate proximity to
the pin wherewith his antagonist had begun.”
