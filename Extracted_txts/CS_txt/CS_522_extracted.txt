34.2 Polynomial-time verification 1065

 

(b)

P=NP/ co-NP

(c) (d)

Figure 34.3 Four possibilities for relationships among complexity classes. In each diagram, one
region enclosing another indicates a proper-subset relation. (a) P = NP = co-NP. Most researchers
regard this possibility as the most unlikely. (b) If NP is closed under complement, then NP = co-NP,
but it need not be the case that P = NP. (c) P = NP/co-NP, but NP is not closed under complement.
(d) NP # co-NP and P # NP co-NP. Most researchers regard this possibility as the most likely.

Thus, our understanding of the precise relationship between P and NP is woe-
fully incomplete. Nevertheless, even though we might not be able to prove that a
particular problem is intractable, if we can prove that it is NP-complete, then we
have gained valuable information about it.

Exercises

34.2-1

Consider the language GRAPH-ISOMORPHISM = {(G;, G2) : G; and G2 are
isomorphic graphs}. Prove that GRAPH-ISOMORPHISM € NP by describing a
polynomial-time algorithm to verify the language.

34.2-2
Prove that if G is an undirected bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices,
then G is nonhamiltonian.

34.2-3
Show that if HAM-CYCLE € P, then the problem of listing the vertices of a
hamiltonian cycle, in order, is polynomial-time solvable.
