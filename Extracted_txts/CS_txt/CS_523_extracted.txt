Chapter 34 NP-Completeness

342-4
Prove that the class NP of languages is closed under union, intersection, concate-
nation, and Kleene star. Discuss the closure of NP under complement.

34.2-5
Show that any language in NP can be decided by an algorithm running in
time 20") for some constant k.

34.2-6

A hamiltonian path in a graph is a simple path that visits every vertex exactly
once. Show that the language HAM-PATH = {(G,u, v) : there is a hamiltonian
path from u to v in graph G} belongs to NP.

342-7

Show that the hamiltonian-path problem from Exercise 34.2-6 can be solved in
polynomial time on directed acyclic graphs. Give an efficient algorithm for the
problem.

342-8

Let ¢ be a boolean formula constructed from the boolean input variables x;, x2,
...,X%, negations (—), ANDs (A), ORs (Vv), and parentheses. The formula ¢ is a
tautology if it evaluates to 1 for every assignment of | and 0 to the input variables.
Define TAUTOLOGY as the language of boolean formulas that are tautologies.
Show that TAUTOLOGY € co-NP.

342-9
Prove that P C co-NP.

34.2-10
Prove that if NP 4 co-NP, then P 4 NP.

34.2-11

Let G be a connected, undirected graph with at least 3 vertices, and let G be the
graph obtained by connecting all pairs of vertices that are connected by a path in G
of length at most 3. Prove that G? is hamiltonian. (Hint: Construct a spanning tree
for G, and use an inductive argument.)
