To determine the logic for each encoder input, itis necessary to find the
control functions that place the corresponding register onto the bus. For exam-
ple, tofind the logic that makes x; = 1, we scan all register transfer statements
in Table 5-6 and extract those statements that have AR as a source.

Therefore, the Boolean function for x; is

The data output from memory are selected for the bus when x7 = 1 and
5,515) = 111. The gate logic that generates x, must also be applied to the read
input of memory. Therefore, the Boolean function for x7 is the same as the one
derived previously for the read operation
xy = RIT; + Dil s + (Do+ Dy + Dz + DoT

In a similar manner we can determine the gate logic for the other registers.
