Notes for Chapter 24 683

straâ€™s algorithm, since the sequence of values returned by EXTRACT-MIN calls
does not monotonically increase over time.

For graphs with negative edge weights, an algorithm due to Gabow and Tar-
jan [122] runs in O(./VE lg(VW)) time, and one by Goldberg [137] runs in
O(/VE lg W) time, where W = max eg {|w(u, v) |}.

Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik [64] conducted extensive experiments com-
paring various shortest-path algorithms.
