Figure 34.9 The sequence of configurations produced by an algorithm A running on an input x and
certificate y. Each configuration represents the state of the computer for one step of the computation
and, besides A, x, and y, includes the program counter (PC), auxiliary machine state, and working
storage. Except for the certificate y, the initial configuration co is constant. A boolean combinational
circuit M maps each configuration to the next configuration. The output is a distinguished bit in the
working storage.
