5-10 Design of Accumulator Logic

The circuits associated with the AC register are shown in Fig. 5-19. The adder
and logic circuit has three sets of inputs. One set of 16 inputs comes from the
outputs of AC. Another set of 16 inputs comes from the data register DR. A
third set of eight inputs comes from the input register INPR. The outputs of
the adder and logic circuit provide the data inputs for the register. In addition,
it is necessary to include logic gates for controlling the LD, INR, and CLR in
the register and for controlling the operation of the adder and logic circuit.

In order to design the logic associated with AC, it is necessary to go over
the register transfer statements in Table 5-6 and extract all the statements that
change the content of AC.

Dif: AC-AC A DR AND with DR

Dis AC<AC + DR Add with DR

Djs: AC<—DR Transfer from DR

PBy: AC(O-7) — INPR Transfer from INPR
Bs AC AC Complement

"By: ACeshr AC, AC(I5)—E Shift right
1Be  AC@shlAC, AC()E Shift left
By: ACO Clear

YB: = ACCAC +1 Increment

From this list we can derive the control logic gates and the adder and logic
circuit.
