Mimicking the reduction in the proof of Theorem 34.9, we introduce a vari-
able y; for the output of each internal node. Then, we rewrite the original for-
mula ¢ as the AND of the root variable and a conjunction of clauses describing the
operation of each node. For the formula (34.3), the resulting expression is

g = yA (1S (2 AX)
A (Yo (3 V ya))
A (3 <> (%1 > X2))
A (Y4 < 7Ys)
A (Ys (Yo V X4))
A (Yo <> (7X1 <> x3).

Observe that the formula ¢’ thus obtained is a conjunction of clauses /, each of
which has at most 3 literals. The only requirement that we might fail to meet is
that each clause has to be an OR of 3 literals.

The second step of the reduction converts each clause ¢/ into conjunctive normal
form. We construct a truth table for ¢/ by evaluating all possible assignments to
its variables. Each row of the truth table consists of a possible assignment of the
variables of the clause, together with the value of the clause under that assignment.
Using the truth-table entries that evaluate to 0, we build a formula in disjunctive
normal form (or DNF)—an OR of ANDs—that is equivalent to —¢/. We then
negate this formula and convert it into a CNF formula ¢/ by using DeMorgan’s
