laws for propositional logic,

a(aAb) = -av-b,
a(avb) = -aa-b,

to complement all literals, change ORs into ANDs, and change ANDs into ORs.

In our example, we convert the clause ¢, = (yi < ()2 A 7X2)) into CNF
as follows. The truth table for ¢{ appears in Figure 34.12. The DNF formula
equivalent to =; is

(V1 A Y2 A X2) V 1 A>Y2 A Xa) V V1 A V2 AWX2) V (AVL A V2 A 7X9) -
Negating and applying DeMorgan’s laws, we get the CNF formula

d = (yi V>y2 V Ax2) A(Ay1 V y2 V 7X2)
A (Ay1 V 2 V X2) AWW V 7y2 V X2),

which is equivalent to the original clause ¢}.

At this point, we have converted each clause ¢/ of the formula ¢’ into a CNF
formula @/, and thus ¢’ is equivalent to the CNF formula $” consisting of the
conjunction of the ¢;’. Moreover, each clause of p” has at most 3 literals.

The third and final step of the reduction further transforms the formula so that
each clause has exactly 3 distinct literals. We construct the final 3~-CNF formula 6”
from the clauses of the CNF formula ¢”. The formula #”” also uses two auxiliary
variables that we shall call p and qg. For each clause C; of @”, we include the

following clauses in $'”:

* If C; has 3 distinct literals, then simply include C; as a clause of 6”.

* If C; has 2 distinct literals, that is, if C; = (J; Vv /,), where /; and /, are literals,

then include (J; Vl, V p) A (1; Vv ly V ap) as clauses of ¢””. The literals

p and —p merely fulfill the syntactic requirement that each clause of 6” has
