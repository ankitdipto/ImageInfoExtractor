Chapter 6. Agents that Reason Logically

 

Specifying the environment

Like
squa

the vacuum world, the wumpus world is a grid of squares surrounded by walls, where each
we can contain agents and objects. The agent always starts in the lower left corner, a square

that we will label [1,1]. The agent's task is to find the gold, return to [1,1] and climb out of the

cave.

An example wumpus world is shown in Figure 6.2.

To specify the agent's task, we specify its percepts, actions, and goals. In the wumpus
id, these are as follows:

In the square containing the wumpus and in the directly (not diagonally) adjacent squares
the agent will perceive a stench.

In the squares directly adjacent to a pit, the agent will perceive a breeze.

In the square where the gold is, the agent will perceive a glitter.

When an agent walks into a wall, it will perceive a bump.

When the wumpus is killed, it gives out a woeful scream that can be perceived anywhere
in the cave.

The percepts will be given to the agent in the form ofa list of five symbols; for example,
if there is a stench, a breeze, and a glitter but no bump and no scream, the agent will
receive the percept [Stench, Breeze, Glitter, None, None]. The agent cannot perceive its
own location.

Just as in the vacuum world, there are actions to go forward, turn right by 90°, and turn left
by 90°. In addition, the action Grab can be used to pick up an object that is in the same
square as the agent. The action Shoot can be used to fire an arrow in a straight line in the
direction the agent is facing. The arrow continues until it either hits and kills the wumpus
or hits the wall. The agent only has one arrow, so only the first Shoot action has any effect.
