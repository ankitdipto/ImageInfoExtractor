Figure 34.14 The graph G derived from the 3-CNF formula ¢ = Cy A C2 A C3, where C) =
(x1 V 4x2 V7N3), C2 = (x1 V x2 V x3), and C3 = («1 V x2 Vx3), in reducing 3-CNF-SAT to
CLIQUE. A satisfying assignment of the formula has x2 = 0, x3 = 1, and x1 either 0 or 1. This
assignment satisfies Cy with 4x2, and it satisfies Cp and C3 with x3, corresponding to the clique
with lightly shaded vertices.

1,2,...,k, each clause C, has exactly three distinct literals /7, 13, and 13. We shall
construct a graph G such that ¢ is satisfiable if and only if G has a clique of size k.

We construct the graph G = (V,E) as follows. For each clause C, =
(I v L, v L) in @, we place a triple of vertices vj, v3, and v3 into V. We put
an edge between two vertices vj and v; if both of the following hold:

* vf and Wi are in different triples, that is, r 4 s, and
* their corresponding literals are consistent, that is, /7 is not the negation of /7.

We can easily build this graph from ¢ in polynomial time. As an example of this
construction, if we have

@ = (M1 V 2 V 7x3) A (401 V X2 V-X3) A (M1 V X2 V3),

then G is the graph shown in Figure 34.14.

We must show that this transformation of ¢ into G is a reduction. First, suppose
that ¢ has a satisfying assignment. Then each clause C, contains at least one
literal / that is assigned 1, and each such literal corresponds to a vertex v7. Picking
one such “true” literal from each clause yields a set V’ of k vertices. We claim that
V’ is a clique. For any two vertices v7, v; € V’, where r 4 5, both corresponding
literals 7 and /} map to | by the given satisfying assignment, and thus the literals
