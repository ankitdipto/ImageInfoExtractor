SECTION 510 Design of Accumulator Logic 165,

Control of AC Register

The gate structure that controls the LD, INR, and CLR inputs of ACis shown
in Fig, 5-20. The gate configuration is derived from the control functions in the
list above The control function for the clear microoperation is rBy, where
1 = Djl'T; and By = IR(11). The output of the AND gate that generates this
control function is connected to the CLR input of the register. Similarly, the
output of the gate that implements the increment microoperation is connected
to the INR input of the register. The other seven microoperations are generated
in the adder and logic circuit and are loaded into AC at the proper time. The
outputs of the gates for each control function is marked with a symbolic name.
These outputs are used in the design of the adder and logic circuit.
