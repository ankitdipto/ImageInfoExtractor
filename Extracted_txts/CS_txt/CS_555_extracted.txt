Figure 34.16 ‘The widget used in reducing the vertex-cover problem to the hamiltonian-cycle prob-
lem, An edge (1, v) of graph G corresponds to widget Wy in the graph G’ created in the reduction.
(a) The widget, with individual vertices labeled. (b)-(d) The shaded paths are the only possible ones
through the widget that include all vertices, assuming that the only connections from the widget to
the remainder of G’ are through vertices [u, v, 1], fu, v, 6], [v.1, 1], and [v,1, 6].

integer k, we construct an undirected graph G’ = (V’, E’) that has a hamiltonian
cycle if and only if G has a vertex cover of size k.

Our construction uses a widget, which is a piece of a graph that enforces certain
properties. Figure 34.16(a) shows the widget we use. For each edge (u,v) € E, the
graph G’ that we construct will contain one copy of this widget, which we denote
by Wy. We denote each vertex in Wy, by [u, v, i] or [v,u,i], where 1 <i <6,so
that each widget W,, contains 12 vertices. Widget Wy, also contains the 14 edges
shown in Figure 34.16(a).

Along with the internal structure of the widget, we enforce the properties we
want by limiting the connections between the widget and the remainder of the
graph G’ that we construct. In particular, only vertices [u, v, 1], [u.v, 6], [v. uw. 1],
and [v, wu, 6] will have edges incident from outside W,,. Any hamiltonian cycle
of G’ must traverse the edges of Wy, in one of the three ways shown in Fig-
ures 34.16(b)}-(d). If the cycle enters through vertex [w, v, 1], it must exit through
vertex [u, v, 6], and it either visits all 12 of the widget’s vertices (Figure 34.16(b))
or the six vertices [u,v, 1] through [w, v, 6] (Figure 34.16(c)). In the latter case,
the cycle will have to reenter the widget to visit vertices [v, u, 1] through [v, u, 6].
Similarly, if the cycle enters through vertex [v,u,1], it must exit through ver-
tex [v, u, 6], and it either visits all 12 of the widget’s vertices (Figure 34.16(d)) or
the six vertices [v,u, 1] through [v, u, 6] (Figure 34.16(c)). No other paths through
the widget that visit all 12 vertices are possible. In particular, it is impossible to
construct two vertex-disjoint paths, one of which connects [u, v, 1] to [v,u, 6] and
the other of which connects [v, w, 1] to [, v, 6], such that the union of the two paths
contains all of the widget’s vertices.
