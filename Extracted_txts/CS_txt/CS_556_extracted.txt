Figure 34.17 Reducing an instance of the vertex-cover problem to an instance of the hamiltonian-
cycle problem. (a) An undirected graph G with a vertex cover of size 2, consisting of the lightly
shaded vertices w and y. (b) The undirected graph G’ produced by the reduction, with the hamilto-
nian path corresponding to the vertex cover shaded. The vertex cover {w, ’} corresponds to edges
(s1, fw, x, 1]) and (52, [y, x, 1) appearing in the hamiltonian cycle.

The only other vertices in V’ other than those of widgets are selector vertices
51,52,...,5k. We use edges incident on selector vertices in G’ to select the k
vertices of the cover in G.

In addition to the edges in widgets, E’ contains two other types of edges, which
Figure 34.17 shows. First, for each vertex u € V, we add edges to join pairs
of widgets in order to form a path containing all widgets corresponding to edges
incident on u in G. We arbitrarily order the vertices adjacent to each vertex
u € Vasu, y®,,.., ys) where degree(w) is the number of vertices
adjacent to u. We create a path in G’ through all the widgets corresponding
to edges incident on u by adding to E’ the edges {({u,u, 6], [w.w"*), 1) :
1 <i <degree(w) — 1}. In Figure 34.17, for example, we order the vertices ad-
jacent to w as x, y,Z, and so graph G’ in part (b) of the figure includes the edges
