Chapter 34 NP-Completeness

([w, x, 6], [w, y. 1]) and ([w, y, 6], [w,z. 1]). For each vertex u € V, these edges
in G’ fill in a path containing all widgets corresponding to edges incident on u
inG.

The intuition behind these edges is that if we choose a vertex u € V in the vertex
cover of G, we can construct a path from [u,v 1] to [, “2°, 6] in G’ that
“covers” all widgets corresponding to edges incident on u. That is, for each of these
widgets, say W, ,«, the path either includes all 12 vertices (if u is in the vertex
cover but uv is not) or just the six vertices [w, uw, 1], [u,u,2],..., [uu 6] Gf
both w and uw“ are in the vertex cover).

The final type of edge in E’ joins the first vertex [w, wv“), 1] and the last vertex
for, tester), 6] of each of these paths to each of the selector vertices. That is, we
include the edges

{(s;,[u.w, 1): we Vand 1 <j <k}
U{(s;. fu, ue") 6}) su eV andl <j <k}.

Next, we show that the size of G’ is polynomial in the size of G, and hence we
can construct G’ in time polynomial in the size of G. The vertices of G’ are those
in the widgets, plus the selector vertices. With 12 vertices per widget, plus k < |V|
selector vertices, we have a total of
\V'| = 12|E|+k

= BIE|+I|V|
vertices. The edges of G’ are those in the widgets, those that go between widgets,
and those connecting selector vertices to widgets. Each widget contains 14 edges,

totaling 14 |Z| in all widgets. For each vertex u € V, graph G’ has degree(u) — 1
edges going between widgets, so that summed over all vertices in V,

Yo egree(u) — 1) = 2 |E|—|V|
ueV
edges go between widgets. Finally, G’ has two edges for each pair consisting of a
selector vertex and a vertex of V, totaling 2k |V | such edges. The total number of
edges of G’ is therefore
|E"| (14 |E|) + (2 |E|—|V)) + (2k |V|)

= 16|E|+(2k—-1)|V|

< 16|E\+@2|Vj-DIV|.

Now we show that the transformation from graph G to G’ is a reduction. That is,
we must show that G has a vertex cover of size k if and only if G’ has a hamiltonian
cycle.
