34.5 NP-complete problems 1095

Suppose that G = (V,E) has a vertex cover V* C V of size k. Let
V* = {ui,U2,...,ue}. As Figure 34.17 shows, we form a hamiltonian cy-
cle in G’ by including the following edges" for each vertex uj € V*. Include
edges {(uj.u?. 6], [uj 1): 1 Si < degree(w;) — 1}, which connect all
widgets corresponding to edges incident on u;. We also include the edges within
these widgets as Figures 34.16(b)-(d) show, depending on whether the edge is cov-

ered by one or two vertices in V*. The hamiltonian cycle also includes the edges
{Usj.fej.aj?. I) 1 <7 sk)

Ul(ser. [uj uh 6) 1 <j <k-1}

U f(s1, fue. (eerste » 6)} .

By inspecting Figure 34.17, you can verify that these edges forma cycle. The cycle
starts at 51, visits all widgets corresponding to edges incident on w;, then visits 52,
visits all widgets corresponding to edges incident on uw, and so on, until it returns
to s;. The cycle visits each widget either once or twice, depending on whether one
or two vertices of V* cover its corresponding edge. Because V* is a vertex cover
for G, each edge in E is incident on some vertex in V*, and so the cycle visits each
vertex in each widget of G’. Because the cycle also visits every selector vertex, it
is hamiltonian.

Conversely, suppose that G’ = (V’, E’) has a hamiltonian cycle C C E’. We
claim that the set

V* ={u eV :(s;,[u.u, I) € C for some 1 < j <k} (34.4)

is a vertex cover for G. To see why, partition C into maximal paths that start at
some selector vertex s;, traverse an edge (s;, [w, uw, 1]) for some u € V, and end
at a selector vertex s; without passing through any other selector vertex. Let us call
each such path a “cover path.” From how G’ is constructed, each cover path must
start at some 57, take the edge (s;, [v, uw, 1]) for some vertex u € V, pass through
all the widgets corresponding to edges in E incident on u, and then end at some
selector vertex 5;. We refer to this cover path as p,, and by equation (34.4), we
put u into V*. Each widget visited by p, must be W,, or W,, for some v € V.
For each widget visited by p,, its vertices are visited by either one or two cover
paths. If they are visited by one cover path, then edge (u,v) € E is covered in G
by vertex u. If two cover paths visit the widget, then the other cover path must
be py, which implies that v € V*, and edge (u,v) € E is covered by both wu and v.

 

Technically, we define a cycle in terms of vertices rather than edges (see Section B.4). In the
interest of clarity, we abuse notation here and define the hamiltonian cycle in terms of edges.
