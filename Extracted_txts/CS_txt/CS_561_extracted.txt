Chapter 34 NP-Completeness

 

Figure 34.18 An instance of the traveling-salesman problem. Shaded edges represent a minimum-
cost tour, with cost 7.

Because each vertex in each widget is visited by some cover path, we see that each
edge in E is covered by some vertex in V*. .

34.5.4 The traveling-salesman problem

In the traveling-salesman problem, which is closely related to the hamiltonian-
cycle problem, a salesman must visit 7 cities. Modeling the problem as a complete
graph with 7 vertices, we can say that the salesman wishes to make a four, or
hamiltonian cycle, visiting each city exactly once and finishing at the city he starts
from. The salesman incurs a nonnegative integer cost c(i, j) to travel from city i
to city 7, and the salesman wishes to make the tour whose total cost is minimum,
where the total cost is the sum of the individual costs along the edges of the tour.
For example, in Figure 34.18, a minimum-cost tour is (vu, w, vx, u), with cost 7.
The formal language for the corresponding decision problem is

TSP = {(G.c,k) : G = (V, E) is acomplete graph,
c is a function from V x V > Z,
kâ‚¬Z,and
G has a traveling-salesman tour with cost at most k} .

 

The following theorem shows that a fast algorithm for the traveling-salesman
problem is unlikely to exist.

Theorem 34.14
The traveling-salesman problem is NP-complete.

Proof We first show that TSP belongs to NP. Given an instance of the problem,
we use as a certificate the sequence of n vertices in the tour. The verification
algorithm checks that this sequence contains each vertex exactly once, sums up the
edge costs, and checks whether the sum is at most k. This process can certainly be
done in polynomial time.
