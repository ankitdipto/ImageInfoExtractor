‘Adder and Logic Circuit
The adder and logic circuit can be subdivided into 16 stages, with each stage
corresponding to one bit of AC. The internal construction of the register is as
shown in Fig. 2-11. Looking back at that figure we note that each stage has a
JK flip-flop, two OR gates, and two AND gates. The load (LD) input is con-
nected to the inputs of the AND gates. Figure 5-21 shows one such AC register
stage (with the OR gates removed). The input is labeled I, and the output AC().
When the LD input is enabled, the 16 inputs I, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., 15 are
transferred to AC (0-15).

One stage of the adder and logic circuit consists of seven AND gates, one
OR gate and a full-adder (FA), asshown in Fig. 5-21. The inputs of the gates with
symbolic names come from the outputs of gates marked with the same symbolic
name in Fig, 5-20. For example, the input marked ADD in Fig. 5-21 is connected
to the output marked ADD in Fig. 5-20.

‘The AND operation is achieved by ANDing AC(i) with the corresponding
bit in the data register DR(j). The ADD operation is obtained using a binary
adder similar to the one shown in Fig. 46. One stage of the adder uses a
