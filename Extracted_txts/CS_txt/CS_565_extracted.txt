Figure 34.19 The reduction of 3-CNF-SAT to SUBSET-SUM. The formula in 3-CNF is ¢ =
Cy AC2AC3AC4, where Cy = (1 V7X2V7N3), C2 = (4X1 V7xK2V7N3), C3 = (441 V7X2VN3),
and C4 = (x1 V x2 V x3). A satisfying assignment of ¢ is (x1 = 0,x2 = 0,x3 = 1). The set S
produced by the reduction consists of the base-10 numbers shown; reading from top to bottom, S =
{1001001, 1000110, 100001, 101110, 10011, 11100, 1000, 2000, 100, 200, 10, 20, 1, 2}. The target 7
is 1114444, The subset S’  S is lightly shaded, and it contains v',, v5, and v3, corresponding to the
satisfying assignment. It also contains slack variables 51, 54, 54, 53, 84, and s4 to achieve the target
value of 4 in the digits labeled by C; through C4.

the s; and Sj values). Interpreting these numbers in base 10, therefore, no carries
can occur from lower digits to higher digits.'!

We can perform the reduction in polynomial time. The set S contains 2n + 2k
values, each of which has n + k digits, and the time to produce each digit is poly-
nomial inn + k. The target ¢ has n + k digits, and the reduction produces each in
constant time.

We now show that the 3-CNF formula ¢ is satisfiable if and only if there exists
asubset S’ C S whose sum is f. First, suppose that ¢ has a satisfying assignment.
Fori =1,2,...,n, if x; = 1 in this assignment, then include v; in S’. Otherwise,
include v;. In other words, we include in S’ exactly the v; and vj values that cor-

the set S and target ¢ in Figure 34.19 interpreted in base 7, with S listed in sorted order.
