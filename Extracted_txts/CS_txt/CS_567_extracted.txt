Problems for Chapter 34 1101

ments in the set {0,1} such that Ax < b. Prove that 0-1 integer programming is
NP-complete. (Hint: Reduce from 3-CNF-SAT.)

34,5-3

The integer linear-programming problem is like the 0-1 integer-programming
problem given in Exercise 34.5-2, except that the values of the vector x may be
any integers rather than just 0 or 1. Assuming that the 0-1 integer-programming
problem is NP-hard, show that the integer linear-programming problem is NP-
complete.

34.5-4
Show how to solve the subset-sum problem in polynomial time if the target value ¢
is expressed in unary.

34,5-5

The set-partition problem takes as input a set S of numbers. The question is
whether the numbers can be partitioned into two sets A and A = S — A such
that > 24% = )2yeqX. Show that the set-partition problem is NP-complete.

34.5-6
Show that the hamiltonian-path problem is NP-complete.

34.5-7

The longest-simple-cycle problem is the problem of determining a simple cycle
(no repeated vertices) of maximum length in a graph. Formulate a related decision
problem, and show that the decision problem is NP-complete.

34.5-8

In the half 3-CNF satisfiability problem, we are given a 3-CNF formula ¢ with n
variables and m clauses, where m is even. We wish to determine whether there
exists a truth assignment to the variables of @ such that exactly half the clauses
evaluate to 0 and exactly half the clauses evaluate to 1. Prove that the half 3-CNF
satisfiability problem is NP-complete.

 

Problems

34-1 Independent set

An independent set of a graph G = (V, E) is a subset V’ © V of vertices such
that each edge in E is incident on at most one vertex in V’. The independent-set
problem is to find a maximum-size independent set in G.
