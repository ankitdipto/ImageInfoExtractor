25.1 Shortest paths and matrix multiplication 687

The structure of a shortest path

We start by characterizing the structure of an optimal solution. For the all-pairs
shortest-paths problem on a graph G = (V, £), we have proven (Lemma 24.1)
that all subpaths of a shortest path are shortest paths. Suppose that we represent
the graph by an adjacency matrix W = (wj). Consider a shortest path p from
vertex i to vertex j, and suppose that p contains at most m edges. Assuming that
there are no negative-weight cycles, m is finite. If i = j, then p has weight 0
and no edges. If vertices i and j are distinct, then we decompose path p into

i2k—a Jj, where path p’ now contains at most m — 1 edges. By Lemma 24.1,
Pp’ is ashortest path from i to k, and so 6(i, 7) = 8(i,k) + we.

A recursive solution to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem
Now, let i” be the minimum weight of any path from vertex i to vertex j that
contains at most m edges. When m = 0, there is a shortest path from i to j with
no edges if and only if i = j. Thus,

10 -)9 ifi=s.
iu oo ifi xj.

For m > 1, we compute as the minimum of ie? (the weight of a shortest
path from i to j consisting of at most m—1 edges) and the minimum weight of any
path from i to j consisting of at most m edges, obtained by looking at all possible
predecessors k of j. Thus, we recursively define

The latter equality follows since wj; = 0 for all 7.

What are the actual shortest-path weights 5(i, 7)? If the graph contains
no negative-weight cycles, then for every pair of vertices i and j for which
5(i, 7) < 00, there is a shortest path from i to j that is simple and thus contains at
most 1 — 1 edges. A path from vertex i to vertex j with more than n — 1 edges
cannot have lower weight than a shortest path from i to j. The actual shortest-path
weights are therefore given by
