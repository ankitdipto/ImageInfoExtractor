34-4 Scheduling with profits and deadlines

Suppose that we have one machine and a set of 7 tasks a).2.....d,, each of
which requires time on the machine. Each task a; requires /; time units on the
machine (its processing time), yields a profit of p;, and has a deadline dj. The
machine can process only one task at a time, and task a; must run without inter-
ruption for f; consecutive time units. If we complete task a; by its deadline d;, we
receive a profit p;, but if we complete it after its deadline, we receive no profit. As
an optimization problem, we are given the processing times, profits, and deadlines
for a set of n tasks, and we wish to find a schedule that completes all the tasks and
returns the greatest amount of profit. The processing times, profits, and deadlines
are all nonnegative numbers.

 

 

a. State this problem as a decision problem.
b. Show that the decision problem is NP-complete.

c. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem, assuming that all
processing times are integers from 1 to n. (Hint: Use dynamic programming.)

d. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the optimization problem, assuming that
all processing times are integers from | to n.

 

Chapter notes

The book by Garey and Johnson [129] provides a wonderful guide to NP-complete-
ness, discussing the theory at length and providing a catalogue of many problems
that were known to be NP-complete in 1979. The proof of Theorem 34.13 is
adapted from their book, and the list of NP-complete problem domains at the begin-
ning of Section 34.5 is drawn from their table of contents. Johnson wrote a series
