Notes for Chapter 34 1105

of 23 columns in the Journal of Algorithms between 1981 and 1992 reporting new
developments in NP-completeness. Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman [177], Lewis
and Papadimitriou [236], Papadimitriou [270], and Sipser [317] have good treat-
ments of NP-completeness in the context of complexity theory. NP-completeness
and several reductions also appear in books by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5];
Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani [82]; Johnsonbaugh and Schaefer [193];
and Kleinberg and Tardos [208].

The class P was introduced in 1964 by Cobham [72] and, independently, in 1965
by Edmonds [100], who also introduced the class NP and conjectured that P 4 NP.
The notion of NP-completeness was proposed in 1971 by Cook [75], who gave
the first NP-completeness proofs for formula satisfiability and 3-CNF satisfiabil-
ity. Levin [234] independently discovered the notion, giving an NP-completeness
proof for a tiling problem. Karp [199] introduced the methodology of reductions
in 1972 and demonstrated the rich variety of NP-complete problems. Karp’s pa-
per included the original NP-completeness proofs of the clique, vertex-cover, and
hamiltonian-cycle problems. Since then, thousands of problems have been proven
to be NP-complete by many researchers. In a talk at a meeting celebrating Karp’s
60th birthday in 1995, Papadimitriou remarked, “about 6000 papers each year have
the term ‘NP-complete’ on their title, abstract, or list of keywords. This is more
than each of the terms ‘compiler, ‘database,’ ‘expert,’ ‘neural network,’ or ‘oper-
ating system.’ ”

Recent work in complexity theory has shed light on the complexity of computing
approximate solutions. This work gives a new definition of NP using “probabilis-
tically checkable proofs.” This new definition implies that for problems such as
clique, vertex cover, the traveling-salesman problem with the triangle inequality,
and many others, computing good approximate solutions is NP-hard and hence no
easier than computing optimal solutions. An introduction to this area can be found
in Arora’s thesis [20]; a chapter by Arora and Lund in Hochbaum [172]; a survey
article by Arora [21]; a book edited by Mayr, Prémel, and Steger [246]; and a
survey article by Johnson [191].
