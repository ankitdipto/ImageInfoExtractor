Figure 1-14 Example of map with don't-care conditions.

The function is determined completely once the x's are assigned to the
1's or O's in the map. Thus the expression

FeA'+BC
represents the Boolean function
F(A, B,C) = & ,1,2,3,6)

It consists of the original minterms 0, 2, and 6 and the don't-care minterms 1
and 3. Minterm 5 is not included in the function. Since minterms 1, 3, and 5
were specified as being don't-care conditions, we have chosen min terms 1 and
3to produce a 1 and minterm 5 to produce a0. This was chosen because this
assignment produces the simplest Boolean expression.

1-5__Combinational Circuits

A combinational circuit is a connected arrangement of logic gates with a set of
inputs and outputs. At any given time, the binary values of the outputs are a
function of the binary combination of the inputs. A block diagram of a combi-
national circuit is shown in Fig. 1-15. The n binary input variables come from
an external source, the m binary output variables go to an external destination,
and in between there is an interconnection of logic gates. A combinational
Circuit transforms binary information from the giveninput data to the required
output data. Combinational circuits are employed in digital computers for
generating binary control decisions and for providing digital components
required for data processing.

‘A combinational circuit can be described by a truth table showing the
binary relationship between the n input variables and the m output variables.
The truth table lists the corresponding output binary values for each of the 2"
input combinations A combinational circuit can also be specified with m
Boolean functions, one for each output variable. Each output function is
expressed in terms of the n input variables.
