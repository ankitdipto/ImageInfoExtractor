fulkadder with the corresponding input andoutput carries. The transfer from
INPR toACis only for bits 0 through 7. The eomplement mixrouperation is
obtained by inverting the bit value in AC. The shift-right operation transfers
the bit from AC( +1), and the shift-left operation transfers the bit from
AC{i — 1). The complete adder and Jogic circuit consists of 16 stages commected
together.

PROBLEMS

 

 

‘A computer uses a memory unit with 256K words of 32 bita each. A binary

instruction cede is stored in one wont of memory. The instruction has four

parts: an indirect bit, an operation code, a register code pait to specify one

Of 64 registers, and an address part

a. How many bits are there in the opemtion code, the register code part,
and the address patt?

bb. Draw the instruction word format and indicate the nusaber of bits in each

a.

c. How many bits are therein the data and addseas inputs ofthe memory?

What is the difference between a direct and an indirect address instruction?

How many references to memory are needed for each type of instruction to

bring an operand into a pracessor iegister?

For each transfer, specify: (1) the binary value that must be applied to bus

‘operation in the adder and logic circuit (if any).
