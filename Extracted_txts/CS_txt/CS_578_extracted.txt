Figure 35.1 The operation of APPROX-VERTEX-COVER. (a) The input graph G, which has 7
vertices and 8 edges. (b) The edge (b,c), shown heavy, is the first edge chosen by APPROX-VERTEX-
Cover. Vertices b and c, shown lightly shaded, are added to the set C containing the vertex cover
being created. Edges (a, b), (c,e), and (c,d), shown dashed, are removed since they are now covered
by some vertex in C. (©) Edge (e, f) is chosen; vertices e and f are added to C. (d) Edge (d, g)
is chosen; vertices d and g are added to C. (e) The set C, which is the vertex cover produced by
APPROX-VERTEX-COVER, contains the six vertices b,c, d,e, fg. (f) The optimal vertex cover for
this problem contains only three vertices: b, d, and e.

Figure 35.1 illustrates how APPROX-VERTEX-COVER operates on an example
graph. The variable C contains the vertex cover being constructed. Line 1 ini-
tializes C to the empty set. Line 2 sets E’ to be a copy of the edge set G.E of
the graph. The loop of lines 3-6 repeatedly picks an edge (u,v) from E’, adds its
