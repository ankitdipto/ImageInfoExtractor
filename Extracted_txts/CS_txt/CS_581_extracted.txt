35.2. The traveling-salesman problem II

is, as we argued in the proof of Theorem 35.1, a lower bound on the size of an
optimal vertex cover. The algorithm returns a vertex cover whose size is at most
twice the size of the maximal matching A. By relating the size of the solution
returned to the lower bound, we obtain our approximation ratio. We will use this
methodology in later sections as well.

Exercises

35.1-1
Give an example of a graph for which APPROX-VERTEX-COVER always yields a
suboptimal solution.

35.1-2
Prove that the set of edges picked in line 4 of APPROX-VERTEX-COVER forms a
maximal matching in the graph G.

Professor Biindchen proposes the following heuristic to solve the vertex-cover
problem. Repeatedly select a vertex of highest degree, and remove all of its in-
cident edges. Give an example to show that the professor’s heuristic does not have
an approximation ratio of 2. (Hint: Try a bipartite graph with vertices of uniform
degree on the left and vertices of varying degree on the right.)

35.1-4
Give an efficient greedy algorithm that finds an optimal vertex cover for a tree in
linear time.

35.1-5

From the proof of Theorem 34.12, we know that the vertex-cover problem and the
NP-complete clique problem are complementary in the sense that an optimal vertex
cover is the complement of a maximum-size clique in the complement graph. Does
this relationship imply that there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm
with a constant approximation ratio for the clique problem? Justify your answer.

 

35.2. The traveling-salesman problem

In the traveling-salesman problem introduced in Section 34.5.4, we are given a
complete undirected graph G = (V, £) that has a nonnegative integer cost c(u, v)
associated with each edge (u,v) € E, and we must find a hamiltonian cycle (a
tour) of G with minimum cost. As an extension of our notation, let c(A) denote
the total cost of the edges in the subset A C E:
