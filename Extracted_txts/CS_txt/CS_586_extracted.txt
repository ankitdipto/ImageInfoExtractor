Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms

Now, consider the traveling-salesman problem (G’,c). If the original graph G
has a hamiltonian cycle H, then the cost function c assigns to each edge of H a
cost of 1, and so (G’,c) contains a tour of cost |V|. On the other hand, if G does
not contain a hamiltonian cycle, then any tour of G’ must use some edge not in E.
But any tour that uses an edge not in E has a cost of at least

(@\Vit+D+(V|/-) = piv +|h|
> p\lV|.

Because edges not in G are so costly, there is a gap of at least p|V| between the cost
of a tour that is a hamiltonian cycle in G (cost |V |) and the cost of any other tour
(cost at least p|V| + |V|). Therefore, the cost of a tour that is not a hamiltonian
cycle in G is at least a factor of p + 1 greater than the cost of a tour that is a
hamiltonian cycle in G.

Now, suppose that we apply the approximation algorithm A to the traveling-
salesman problem (G’,c). Because A is guaranteed to return a tour of cost no
more than p times the cost of an optimal tour, if G contains a hamiltonian cycle,
then A must return it. If G has no hamiltonian cycle, then A returns a tour of cost
more than p|V|. Therefore, we can use A to solve the hamiltonian-cycle problem
in polynomial time. .

The proof of Theorem 35.3 serves as an example of a general technique for
proving that we cannot approximate a problem very well. Suppose that given an
NP-hard problem X, we can produce in polynomial time a minimization prob-
lem Y such that “yes” instances of X correspond to instances of Y with value at
most k (for some k), but that “no” instances of X correspond to instances of Y
with value greater than pk. Then, we have shown that, unless P = NP, there is no
polynomial-time p-approximation algorithm for problem Y.

Exercises

35.2-1

Suppose that a complete undirected graph G = (V, E) with at least 3 vertices has
a cost function c that satisfies the triangle inequality. Prove that c(u, v) > 0 for all
uve.

35.2-2

Show how in polynomial time we can transform one instance of the traveling-
salesman problem into another instance whose cost function satisfies the triangle
inequality. The two instances must have the same set of optimal tours. Explain
why such a polynomial-time transformation does not contradict Theorem 35.3, as-
suming that P 4 NP.
