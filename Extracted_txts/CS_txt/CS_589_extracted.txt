Consider the instruction formats of the basic computer shown in Fig. 5-5 and
the list of instructions given in Table 5-2. For each of the following 16-bit
instructions, give the equivalent four-digit hexadecimal code and explain in
your own words what itis that the instruction is going to perform.

‘a 0001 0000 0010 0100

b. 1011 0001 0010 0100

0111 0000 0010 0000

‘What are the two instructions needed in the basic computer in order to set
the E flip-flop to 1?

Draw a timing diagram similar to Fig. 5-7 assuming that SC is cleared to 0
at time T; if control signal C; is active.

GT: sc-o

Cris activated with the positive clock transition associated with T,.
‘The content of AC in the basic computer is hexadecimal A937 and the initial
value of Eis 1. Determine the contents of AC, E, PC, AR, and IR in hexadec-
imal after the execution of the CLA instruction Repeat 11 more times,
starting from each one of the register reference instructions, The initial value
of PC is hexadecimal 021.
‘An instruction at address 021 in the basic computer has I = 0, an operation.
code of the AND instruction, and an address part equal to 083 (all numbers
are in hexadecimal). The memory word at address 083 contains the operand
BBF2 and the content of AC is A937. Go over the instruction cycle and
determine the contents of the following registers at the end of the execute
phase: PC, AR, DR, AC, and IR. Repeat the problem six more times starting
with an operation code of another memory-reference instruction.
Show the contents in hexadecimal of registers PC, AR, DR, IR, and SC of
the basic computer when an ISZ indirect instruction is fetched from memory
and executed. The initial content of PC is 7FF. The content of memory at
address 7FF is EAP. The content of memory at address A9F is 0C35. The
content of memory at address C35 is FFFF. Give the answer in a table with
five columns, one for each register and a row for each timing signal. Show
the contents of the registers after the positive transition of each clock pulse.
‘The contentof PC in the basiccomputeris 3AF (all numbers are in hexadec-
imal) The content of AC is 7EC3. The content of memory at address 3AF is
932E. The content ofmemory ataddress32E is 09AC. Thecontentof memory
ataddress 9AC is 8B9F.
a. What is the instruction that will be fetched and executed next?
b. Show the binary operation that will be performed in the AC when the
instruction is executed.
