Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms

To show that GREEDY-SET-COVER is a p(/)-approximation algorithm, we as-
sign a cost of | to each set selected by the algorithm, distribute this cost over
the elements covered for the first time, and then use these costs to derive the de-
sired relationship between the size of an optimal set cover €* and the size of the
set cover € returned by the algorithm. Let S; denote the ith subset selected by
GREEDY-SET-CoveR; the algorithm incurs a cost of 1 when it adds S; to €. We
spread this cost of selecting S; evenly among the elements covered for the first time
by S;. Let cx denote the cost allocated to element x, for each x € X. Each element
is assigned a cost only once, when it is covered for the first time. If x is covered
for the first time by S;, then

|S; = (S) US, Us US;-)| ”

Each step of the algorithm assigns 1 unit of cost, and so

Each element x € X is in at least one set in the optimal cover €*, and so we have

Combining equation (35.9) and inequality (35.10), we have that

The remainder of the proof rests on the following key inequality, which we shall
prove shortly. For any set S belonging to the family ¥,

From inequalities (35.11) and (35.12), it follows that

thus proving the theorem.

All that remains is to prove inequality (35.12). Consider any set S € ¥ and any
i=1,2,..., ||, and let
u; = |S —(S; US, U---US;)|
be the number of elements in S that remain uncovered after the algorithm has
selected sets $,,53,..., S;. We define uy = |S| to be the number of elements
