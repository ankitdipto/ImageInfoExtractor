35.3 The set-covering problem 1/21

of S, which are all initially uncovered. Let k be the least index such that uz = 0,

so that every element in S is covered by at least one of the sets $1, S2,..., Sx and
some element in S is uncovered by S; U S, U--- U Sx—1. Then, uj, > uj, and
uj—1 — u; elements of S are covered for the first time by S;, fori = 1,2,...,k.
Thus,

k 1
Ye = Lr) SRO USN

Observe that
|Si — ($1 U Sp UU Si-a)| = |S — ($1 US2 V+ U Si-1)|
= Ui-,

because the greedy choice of S; guarantees that S cannot cover more new ele-
ments than S; does (otherwise, the algorithm would have chosen S instead of S;).
Consequently, we obtain

We now bound this quantity as follows:

= H(uo)— H(ux) (because the sum telescopes)
= HA(uo) — H(0)

= H(uo) (because H(0) = 0)

= A(\s\).

which completes the proof of inequality (35.12). .
