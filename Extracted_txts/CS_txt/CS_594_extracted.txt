Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms

Corollary 35.5
GREEDY-SET-COVER is a polynomial-time (In |X | + 1)-approximation algorithm.

Proof Use inequality (A.14) and Theorem 35.4. .

In some applications, max {|S'| : S € F} is a small constant, and so the solution
returned by GREEDY-SET-COVER is at most a small constant times larger than
optimal. One such application occurs when this heuristic finds an approximate
vertex cover for a graph whose vertices have degree at most 3. In this case, the
solution found by GREEDY-SET-COVER is not more than H(3) = 11/6 times as
large as an optimal solution, a performance guarantee that is slightly better than
that of APPROX-VERTEX-COVER.

Exercises

35.3-1

Consider each of the following words as a set of letters: {arid,dash, drain,
heard, lost, nose, shun, slate, snare, thread}. Show which set cover
GREEDY-SET-COVER produces when we break ties in favor of the word that ap-
pears first in the dictionary.

35.3-2
Show that the decision version of the set-covering problem is NP-complete by
reducing it from the vertex-cover problem.

35.3-3
Show how to implement GREEDY-SET-COVER in such a way that it runs in time

O(Dses ISI):

35.34
Show that the following weaker form of Theorem 35.4 is trivially true:

JE] < Je*|max {|S]:S¢F}.

353-5

GREEDY-SET-COVER can return a number of different solutions, depending on
how we break ties in line 4. Give a procedure BAD-SET-COVER-INSTANCE (11)
that returns an 1-element instance of the set-covering problem for which, depend-
ing on how we break ties in line 4, GREEDY-SET-COVER can return a number of
different solutions that is exponential inn.
