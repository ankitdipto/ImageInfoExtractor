35.4 Randomization and linear programming 1125

vertex cover, by using a linear program. We shall then “round” this solution and
use it to obtain a vertex cover.

Suppose that we associate a variable x(v) with each vertex v € V, and let us
require that x(v) equals either 0 or 1 foreach v € V. We put v into the vertex cover
if and only if x(v) = 1. Then, we can write the constraint that for any edge (u,v),
at least one of u and v must be in the vertex cover as x(u) + x(v) => 1. This view
gives rise to the following 0-1 integer program for finding a minimum-weight
vertex cover:

minimize > w(v) x(v) (35.14)
veVv
subject to
x(uy+x(v) > 1 for each (u,v) € E (35.15)
x(v) € {0,1} foreachveV. (35.16)

In the special case in which all the weights w(v) are equal to 1, this formu-
lation is the optimization version of the NP-hard vertex-cover problem. Sup-
pose, however, that we remove the constraint that x(v) € {0,1} and replace it
by 0 < x(v) < 1. We then obtain the following linear program, which is known as
the linear-programming relaxation:

minimize > w(v) x(v) (35.17)
vev
subject to

xX(u)+x(v) > 1 foreach (u,v) € E (35.18)
x(v) < 1 foreachv eV (35.19)
xX(v) => 0 foreachveV. (35.20)

Any feasible solution to the 0-1 integer program in lines (35.14)-(35.16) is also
a feasible solution to the linear program in lines (35.17)-(35.20). Therefore, the
value of an optimal solution to the linear program gives a lower bound on the value
of an optimal solution to the 0-1 integer program, and hence a lower bound on the
optimal weight in the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem.

The following procedure uses the solution to the linear-programming relaxation
to construct an approximate solution to the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem:
