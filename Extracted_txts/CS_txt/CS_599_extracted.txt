Combining inequalities (35.21) and (35.22) gives
w(C) < 22* < 2w(C*),

and hence APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT- VC is a 2-approximation algorithm. .

Exercises

35.4-1

Show that even if we allow a clause to contain both a variable and its negation, ran-
domly setting each variable to 1 with probability 1/2 and to 0 with probability 1/2
still yields a randomized 8/7-approximation algorithm.

35.4-2

The MAX-CNF satisfiability problem is like the MAX-3-CNF satisfiability prob-
lem, except that it does not restrict each clause to have exactly 3 literals. Give a
randomized 2-approximation algorithm for the MAX-CNF satisfiability problem.

35.4-3

In the MAX-CUT problem, we are given an unweighted undirected graph G =
(V, E). We define a cut (S, V — S) as in Chapter 23 and the weight of a cut as the
number of edges crossing the cut. The goal is to find a cut of maximum weight.
Suppose that for each vertex v, we randomly and independently place v in S with
probability 1/2 and in V — S with probability 1/2. Show that this algorithm is a
randomized 2-approximation algorithm.
