ceived by computer designers who specify the architecture of the computer.
In this chapter we choose a particular instruction code to explain the basic
organization and design of digital computers.

Stored Program Organization

The simplest way to organize a computer is to have one processor register and
an instruction code format with two parts. The first part specifies the operation
to beperformed and the second specifiesan address. The memory address tells
the control where to find an operand in memory. This operand is read from
memory and used as the data to be operated on together with the data stored
in the processor register.

Figure 5-1 depicts this type of organization. Instructions are stored in one
section of memory and data in another. For a memory unit with 4096 words
‘we need 12bits to specify an address since 2 = 4096. if we store each instruc-
tion code in one 16-bit memory word, we have available four bits for the
operation code (abbreviated opcode) to specify one out of 16 possible opera-
tions, and 12 bits to specify the address of an operand. The control reads a
16-bit instruction from the program portion of memory. It uses the 12-bit
address part of the instruction to read a 16-bit operand from the data portion
of memory. It then executes the operation specified by the operation code.
