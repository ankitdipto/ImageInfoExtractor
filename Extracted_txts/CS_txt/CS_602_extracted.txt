FIRST VILLAGER: We have found a witch. May we bum her?

ALL: A witch! Burn her!

BEDEVERE: Why do you think she is a witch?

SECOND VILLAGER: She turned me into a newt.

BEDEVERE: A newt?

SECOND VILLAGER (after looking at himselffor some time): 1 got better.

ALL: Burn her anyway.

BEDEVERE: Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.

BEDEVERE: Tell me ... what do you do with witches?

ALL: Burn them.

BEDEVERE: And what do you burn, apart from witches?

FOURTH VILLAGER: ... Wood?

BEDEVERE: So why do witches bum?

SECOND VILLAGER: (pianissimo) Because they're made of wood?

BEDEVERE: Good.

ALL: I see. Yes, of course.

BEDEVERE: So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

FIRST VILLAGER: Make a bridge out of her.

BEDEVERE: Ah. ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

ALL: Yes, ofcourse...um... er...

BEDEVERE: Does wood sinkin water?

ALL: No, no, it floats. Throw her in the pond.

BEDEVERE: Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?

ALL: Bread? No, no no. Apples ... gravy ... very small rocks ...

BEDEVERE: No, no no,

Kinc ARTHUR: A duck!

(They all turn and lookat ARTHUR. BEDEVERE looks up very impressed.)

BEDEVERE: Exactly. So ... logically ...

FIRST VILLAGER (beginning to pick up the thread): If she ... weighs the same as
a duck ... she's made of wood.

BEDEVERE: And therefore?

ALL: A witch!
