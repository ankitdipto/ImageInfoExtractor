Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms

35.54

How would you modify the approximation scheme presented in this section to find
a good approximation to the smallest value not less than ¢ that is a sum of some
subset of the given input list?

35.5-5
Modify the APPROX-SUBSET-SUM procedure to also return the subset of S that
sums to the value z*.

 

Problems

35-1 Bin packing

Suppose that we are given a set of n objects, where the size s; of the ith object
satisfies 0 < 5; < 1. We wish to pack all the objects into the minimum number of
unit-size bins. Each bin can hold any subset of the objects whose total size does
not exceed 1.

a. Prove that the problem of determining the minimum number of bins required is
NP-hard. (Hint: Reduce from the subset-sum problem.)

The first-fit heuristic takes each object in turn and places it into the first bin that
can accommodate it. Let § = )7/_, Si.

b. Argue that the optimal number of bins required is at least [S$].
c. Argue that the first-fit heuristic leaves at most one bin less than half full.

d. Prove that the number of bins used by the first-fit heuristic is never more
than [2S].

e. Prove an approximation ratio of 2 for the first-fit heuristic.

Jf. Give an efficient implementation of the first-fit heuristic, and analyze its running
time.

35-2 Approximating the size of a maximum clique

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. For any k > 1, define G™ to be the undi-
rected graph (V, E®), where V“ is the set of all ordered k-tuples of vertices
from V and E™ is defined so that (v,v2,..., vx) is adjacent to (W,, W2,..., wz)
if and only if fori = 1,2,..., k, either vertex v; is adjacent to w; in G, or else
v; = Wj.
