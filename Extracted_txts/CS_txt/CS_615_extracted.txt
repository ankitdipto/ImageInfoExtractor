Notes for Chapter 35 1139

Since this early work, thousands of approximation algorithms have been de-
signed for a wide range of problems, and there is a wealth of literature on this
field. Recent texts by Ausiello et al. [26], Hochbaum [172], and Vazirani [345]
deal exclusively with approximation algorithms, as do surveys by Shmoys [315]
and Klein and Young [207]. Several other texts, such as Garey and Johnson [129]
and Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [271], have significant coverage of approximation
algorithms as well. Lawler, Lenstra, Rinnooy Kan, and Shmoys [225] provide an
extensive treatment of approximation algorithms for the traveling-salesman prob-
lem.

Papadimitriou and Steiglitz attribute the algorithm APPROX-VERTEX-COVER
to F. Gavril and M. Yannakakis. The vertex-cover problem has been studied exten-
sively (Hochbaum [172] lists 16 different approximation algorithms for this prob-
lem), but all the approximation ratios are at least 2 — o(1).

The algorithm APPROX-TSP-TOUR appears in a paper by Rosenkrantz, Stearns,
and Lewis [298]. Christofides improved on this algorithm and gave a 3/2-approx-
imation algorithm for the traveling-salesman problem with the triangle inequality.
Arora [22] and Mitchell [257] have shown that if the points are in the euclidean
plane, there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme. Theorem 35.3 is due to
Sahni and Gonzalez [301].

The analysis of the greedy heuristic for the set-covering problem is modeled
after the proof published by Chvatal [68] of a more general result; the basic result
as presented here is due to Johnson [190] and Lovasz [238].

The algorithm APPROX-SUBSET-SUM and its analysis are loosely modeled after
related approximation algorithms for the knapsack and subset-sum problems by
Ibarra and Kim [187].

Problem 35-7 is a combinatorial version of a more general result on approximat-
ing knapsack-type integer programs by Bienstock and McClosky [45].

The randomized algorithm for MAX-3-CNF satisfiability is implicit in the work
of Johnson [190]. The weighted vertex-cover algorithm is by Hochbaum [171].
Section 35.4 only touches on the power of randomization and linear program-
ming in the design of approximation algorithms. A combination of these two ideas
yields a technique called “randomized rounding,” which formulates a problem as
an integer linear program, solves the linear-programming relaxation, and interprets
the variables in the solution as probabilities. These probabilities then help guide
the solution of the original problem. This technique was first used by Raghavan
and Thompson [290], and it has had many subsequent uses. (See Motwani, Naor,
and Raghavan [261] for a survey.) Several other notable recent ideas in the field
of approximation algorithms include the primal-dual method (see Goemans and
Williamson [135] for a survey), finding sparse cuts for use in divide-and-conquer
algorithms [229], and the use of semidefinite programming [134].
