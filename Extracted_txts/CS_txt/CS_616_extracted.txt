2 Let Us C

 

efore we can begin to write serious programs in C, it would

be interesting to find out what really is C, how it came into

existence and how does it compare with other computer
languages. In this chapter we would briefly outline these issues.

Four important aspects of any language are the way it stores data,
the way it operates upon this data, how it accomplishes input and
output and how it lets you control the sequence of execution of
instructions in a program. We would discuss the first three of these
building blocks in this chapter.

What is C

C is a programming language developed at AT & T’s Bell
Laboratories of USA in 1972. It was designed and written by a
man named Dennis Ritchie. In the late seventies C began to
replace the more familiar languages of that time like PL/I,
ALGOL, etc. No one pushed C. It wasn’t made the ‘official’ Bell
Labs language. Thus, without any advertisement C’s reputation
spread and its pool of users grew. Ritchie seems to have been
rather surprised that so many programmers preferred C to older
languages like FORTRAN or PL/I, or the newer ones like Pascal
and APL. But, that's what happened.

Possibly why C seems so popular is because it is reliable, simple
and easy to use. Moreover, in an industry where newer languages,
tools and technologies emerge and vanish day in and day out, a
language that has survived for more than 3 decades has to be really
good.

An opinion that is often heard today is — “C has been already
superceded by languages like C++, C# and Java, so why bother to
