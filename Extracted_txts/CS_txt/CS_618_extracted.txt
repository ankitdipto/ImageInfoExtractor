4 Let Us C

 

(e) Mobile devices like cellular phones and palmtops are
becoming increasingly popular. Also, common consumer
devices like microwave oven, washing machines and digital
cameras are getting smarter by the day. This smartness comes
from a microprocessor, an operating system and a program
embedded in this devices. These programs not only have to
run fast but also have to work in limited amount of memory.
No wonder that such programs are written in C. With these
constraints on time and space, C is the language of choice
while building such operating systems and programs.

(f) You must have seen several professional 3D computer games
where the user navigates some object, like say a spaceship and
fires bullets at the invaders. The essence of all such games is
speed. Needless to say, such games won't become popular if
they takes a long time to move the spaceship or to fire a
bullet. To match the expectations of the player the game has
to react fast to the user inputs. This is where C language
scores over other languages. Many popular gaming
frameworks have been built using C language.

(g) At times one is required to very closely interact with the
hardware devices. Since C provides several language
elements that make this interaction feasible without
compromising the performance it is the preferred choice of
the programmer.

I hope that these are very convincing reasons why one should
adopt C as the first and the very important step in your quest for
learning programming languages.

Getting Started with C

Communicating with a computer involves speaking the language
the computer understands, which immediately rules out English as
the language of communication with computer. However, there is
