Chapter 1: Getting Started 5

a close analogy between learning English language and learning C
language. The classical method of learning English is to first learn
the alphabets used in the language, then learn to combine these
alphabets to form words, which in turn are combined to form
sentences and sentences are combined to form paragraphs.
Learning C is similar and easier. Instead of straight-away learning
how to write programs, we must first know what alphabets,
numbers and special symbols are used in C, then how using them
constants, variables and keywords are constructed, and finally how
are these combined to form an instruction. A group of instructions
would be combined later on to form a program. This is illustrated
in the Figure 1.1.
