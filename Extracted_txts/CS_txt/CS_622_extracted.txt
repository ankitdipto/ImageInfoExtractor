At this stage we would restrict our discussion to only Primary
Constants, namely, Integer, Real and Character constants. Let us
see the details of each of these constants. For constructing these
different types of constants certain rules have been laid down.
These rules are as under:

Rules for Constructing Integer Constants

(a) An integer constant must have at least one digit.

(bo) It must not have a decimal point.

(c) It can be either positive or negative.

(d) If no sign precedes an integer constant it is assumed to be
positive.

(e) No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.

(f) The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to 32767.

Truly speaking the range of an Integer constant depends upon the
compiler. For a 16-bit compiler like Turbo C or Turbo C++ the
