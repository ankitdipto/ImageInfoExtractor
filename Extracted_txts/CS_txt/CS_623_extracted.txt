range is —32768 to 32767. For a 32-bit compiler the range would
be even greater. Question like what exactly do you mean by a 16-
bit or a 32-bit compiler, what range of an Integer constant has to
do with the type of compiler and such questions are discussed in
detail in Chapter 16. Till that time it would be assumed that we are
working with a 16-bit compiler.

Ex.: 426
+782
-8000
-7605

Rules for Constructing Real Constants

Real constants are often called Floating Point constants. The real
constants could be written in two forms—Fractional form and
Exponential form.

Following rules must be observed while constructing real
constants expressed in fractional form:

(a) Areal constant must have at least one digit.

(b) It must have a decimal point.

(c) It could be either positive or negative.

(d) Default sign is positive.

(e) No commas or blanks are allowed within a real constant.

Ex.: +325.34
426.0
-32.16
-48.5792

The exponential form of representation of real constants is usually
used if the value of the constant is either too small or too large. It
however doesn’t restrict us in any way from using exponential
form of representation for other real constants.
