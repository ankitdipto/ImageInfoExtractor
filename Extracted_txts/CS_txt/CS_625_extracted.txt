10 Let Us C

 

In exponential form of representation, the real constant is
represented in two parts. The part appearing before ‘e’ is called
mantissa, whereas the part following ‘e’ is called exponent.

Following rules must be observed while constructing real
constants expressed in exponential form:

(a) The mantissa part and the exponential part should be
separated by a letter e.

(b) The mantissa part may have a positive or negative sign.

(c) Default sign of mantissa part is positive.

(d) The exponent must have at least one digit, which must be a
positive or negative integer. Default sign is positive.

(e) Range of real constants expressed in exponential form is
-3.4e38 to 3.438.

Ex.: +3.2e-5
4.108
-0.2e+3
-3.2e-5

Rules for Constructing Character Constants

(a) A character constant is a single alphabet, a single digit or a
single special symbol enclosed within single inverted
commas. Both the inverted commas should point to the left.
For example, ’A’ is a valid character constant whereas ‘A’ is
not.

(bo) The maximum length of a character constant can be 1
character.

Ex.: ‘A’
