SECTION S10 Design of Accumulator Logic 171

5-21. Derive the control gates associated with the program counterPC in the basic
computer.

$22, Deve the control gates for the write input of the memory in the basic
â€˜computer.

523, Show the complete logic of the interrupt Bip-fiops Rin the basic computer.
Use a JK fip-flop and minimize the number of gates.

524. Derive the Boolasn Jogic expression for x (see Table 5-7). Show that x: can
bbe generated with one AND gate andone OR gate.

525. Derive the apiaon expressianf or the gate structure thatclears the sequence
counter SC to 0. Draw the logic diagram of the gates and show how the
outputis connected tothe INR and CLRinpuis of SC (see Fig. 5-6). Minimize
the number of gates.
