12 Let Us C

 

matter. C compiler is able to distinguish between the variable
names by making it compulsory for you to declare the type of any
variable name that you wish to use im a program. This type
declaration is done at the beginning of the program. Following are
the examples of type declaration statements:

Ex.: int si, m_hra;
float bassal ;
char code ;

Since, the maximum allowable length of a variable name is 31
characters, an enormous number of variable names can be
constructed using the above-mentioned rules. It is a good practice
to exploit this enormous choice in naming variables by using
meaningful variable names.

Thus, if we want to calculate simple interest, it is always advisable
to construct meaningful variable names like prin, roi, noy to
represent Principle, Rate of interest and Number of years rather
than using the variables a, b, c.

C Keywords

Keywords are the words whose meaning has already been
explained to the C compiler (or in a broad sense to the computer).
The keywords cannot be used as variable names because if we do
so we are trying to assign a new meaning to the keyword, which is
not allowed by the computer. Some C compilers allow you to
construct variable names that exactly resemble the keywords.
However, it would be safer not to mix up the variable names and
the keywords. The keywords are also called ‘Reserved words’.

There are only 32 keywords available in C. Figure 1.5 gives a list
of these keywords for your ready reference. A detailed discussion
of each of these keywords would be taken up im later chapters
wherever their use is relevant.
