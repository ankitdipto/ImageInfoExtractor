Note that compiler vendors (like Microsoft, Borland, etc.) provide
their own keywords apart from the ones mentioned above. These
include extended keywords like near, far, asm, etc. Though it has
been suggested by the ANSI committee that every such compiler
specific keyword should be preceded by two underscores (as in
__asm ), not every vendor follows this rule.

The First C Program

Armed with the knowledge about the types of variables, constants
& keywords the next logical step is to combine them to form
instructions. However, instead of this, we would write our first C
program now. Once we have done that we would see in detail the
instructions that it made use of.

Before we begin with our first C program do remember the
following rules that are applicable to all C programs:

(a) Each instruction in a C program is written as a separate
statement. Therefore a complete C program would comprise
of a series of statements.
