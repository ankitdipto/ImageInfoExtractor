The statements in a program must appear in the same order in
which we wish them to be executed; unless of course the logic
of the problem demands a deliberate ‘jump’ or transfer of
control to a statement, which is out of sequence.

Blank spaces may be inserted between two words to improve
the readability of the statement. However, no blank spaces are
allowed within a variable, constant or keyword.

All statements are entered in small case letters.

C has no specific rules for the position at which a statement is
to be written. That’s why it is often called a free-form
language.

Every C statement must end with a ;. Thus ; acts as a
statement terminator.

Let us now write down our first C program. It would simply
calculate simple interest for a set of values representing principle,
number of years and rate of interest.

int p,n;
float r, si;

p= 1000;
n=3;
r= 8.5;

si=p*n*r/100;

printf ( "%f" , si) ;
