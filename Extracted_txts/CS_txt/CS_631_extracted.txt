Chapter 1: Getting Started 15

 

Now a few useful tips about the program...

— Comment about the program should be enclosed within /* */.
For example, the first two statements im our program are
comments.

— Though comments are not necessary, it is a good practice to
begin a program with a comment indicating the purpose of the
program, its author and the date on which the program was
written.

— Any number of comments can be written at any place in the
program. For example, a comment can be written before the
statement, after the statement or within the statement as shown
below:

/* formula */ si=p*n*r/ 100;
si=p*n*r/100; /* formula */
si=p*n*r//* formula */ 100;

— Sometimes it is not so obvious as to what a particular
statement in a program accomplishes. At such times it is
worthwhile mentioning the purpose of the statement (or a set
of statements) using a comment. For example:

/* formula for simple interest */
si=p*n*r/ 100;

— Often programmers seem to ignore writing of comments. But
when a team is building big software well commented code is
almost essential for other team members to understand it.
