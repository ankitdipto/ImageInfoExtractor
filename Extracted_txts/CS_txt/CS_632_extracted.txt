Although a lot of comments are probably not necessary in this
program, it is usually the case that programmers tend to use
too few comments rather than too many. An adequate number
of comments can save hours of misery and suffering when you
later try to figure out what the program does.

The normal language rules do not apply to text written within
/* .. */. Thus we can type this text in small case, capital or a
combination. This is because the comments are solely given
for the understanding of the programmer or the fellow
programmers and are completely ignored by the compiler.

Comments cannot be nested. For example,
!* Cal of SI /* Author sam date 01/01/2002 */ */
is invalid.
A comment can be split over more than one line, as in,
I" This is
a jazzy

comment â€œ/

Such a comment is often called a multi-line comment.

main( ) is a collective name given to a set of statements. This
name has to be main( ), it cannot be anything else. All
statements that belong to main( ) are enclosed within a pair of
braces { } as shown below.

main()

{
statement 1 ;
statement 2 ;
