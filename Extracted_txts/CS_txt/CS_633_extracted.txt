statement 3 ;

Technically speaking main( ) is a function. Every function has
a pair of parentheses () associated with it. We would discuss
functions and their working in great detail in Chapter 5.

Any variable used in the program must be declared before
using it. For example,

int p,n;
float r, si;

Any C statement always ends with a ;
For example,

float r, si;
r= 8.5;

In the statement,
si=p*n*r/100;

* and / are the arithmetic operators. The arithmetic operators
available in C are +, -, * and /. C is very rich in operators.
There are about 45 operators available in C. Surprisingly there
is no operator for exponentiation... a slip, which can be
forgiven considering the fact that C has been developed by an
individual, not by a committee.

Once the value of si is calculated it needs to be displayed on
the screen. Unlike other languages, C does not contain any
instruction to display output on the screen. All output to screen
is achieved using readymade library functions. One such
