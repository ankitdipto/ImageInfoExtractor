<format string> can contain,

%d for printing integer values
%c for printing character values

"Of", Si):

“Sd %d Vf %E", p, n, t, Si);
“Simple interest = Rs. %f", si) ;
"Prin = %d \nRate = %f", p, r) ;

The output of the last statement would look like this...

Prin = 1000
Rate = 8.5

What is ‘\n’ doing in this statement? It is called newline and it
takes the cursor to the next line. Therefore, you get the output
split over two lines. ‘\n’ is one of the several Escape
Sequences available in C. These are discussed in detail in
