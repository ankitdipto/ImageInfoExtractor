handy when we want to format the output properly on
separate lines.

printf() can not only print values of variables, it can also
print the result of an expression. An expression is nothing but
a valid combination of constants, variables and operators.
Thus, 3, 3 + 2, c anda + b * c — d all are valid expressions.
The results of these expressions can be printed as shown
below:

printf ("%d %d %d %d", 3,3 +2,c,a+b*c-d);

Note that 3 and ¢ also represent valid expressions.

Compilation and Execution

Once you have written the program you need to type it and instruct
the machine to execute it. To type your C program you need
another program called Editor. Once the program has been typed it
needs to be converted to machine language (0s and 1s) before the
machine can execute it. To carry out this conversion we need
another program called Compiler. Compiler vendors provide an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which consists of an
Editor as well as the Compiler.

There are several such IDEs available in the market targeted
towards different operating systems. For example, Turbo C, Turbo
C++ and Microsoft C are some of the popular compilers that work
under MS-DOS; Visual C++ and Borland C++ are the compilers
that work under Windows, whereas gcc compiler works under
Linux. Note that Turbo C++, Microsoft C++ and Borland C++
software also contain a C compiler bundled with them. If you are a
beginner you would be better off using a simple compiler like
Turbo C or Turbo C++. Once you have mastered the language
elements you can then switch over to more sophisticated compilers
like Visual C++ under Windows or gcc under Linux. Most of the
