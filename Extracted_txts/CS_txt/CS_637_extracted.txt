20 Let Us C

 

programs in this book would work with all the compilers.
Wherever there is a deviation I would point it out that time.

Assuming that you are using a Turbo C or Turbo C++ compiler
here are the steps that you need to follow to compile and execute
your first C program...

(a) Start the compiler at C> prompt. The compiler (TC.EXE is
usually present in C:\T'C\BIN directory).

(b) Select New from the File menu.

(c) Type the program.

(d) Save the program using F2 under a proper name (say
Program1.c).

(e) Use Ctrl+ F9 to compile and execute the program.

(f) Use Alt + F5 to view the output.

Note that on compiling the program its machine language
equivalent is stored as an EXE file (Program].EXE) on the disk.
This file is called an executable file. If we copy this file to another
machine we can execute it there without being required to
recompile it. In fact the other machine need not even have a
compiler to be able to execute the file.

A word of caution! If you run this program in Turbo C++
compiler, you may get an error — “The function printf should
have a prototype”. To get rid of this error, perform the following
steps and then recompile the program.

(a) Select ‘Options’ menu and then select ‘Compiler | C++
Options’. In the dialog box that pops up, select ‘CPP always’
in the ‘Use C++ Compiler’ options.

(b) Again select ‘Options’ menu and then select ‘Environment |
Editor’. Make sure that the default extension is ‘C’ rather than
“CPP”.
