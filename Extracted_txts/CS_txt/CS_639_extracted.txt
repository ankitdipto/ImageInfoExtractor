Receiving Input

In the program discussed above we assumed the values of p, n and
r to be 1000, 3 and 8.5. Every time we run the program we would
get the same value for simple interest. If we want to calculate
simple interest for some other set of values then we are required to
make the relevant change in the program, and again compile and
execute it. Thus the program is not general enough to calculate
simple interest for any set of values without being required to
make a change in the program. Moreover, if you distribute the
EXE file of this program to somebody he would not even be able
to make changes in the program. Hence it is a good practice to
create a program that is general enough to work for any set of
values.

To make the program general the program itself should ask the
user to supply the values of p, n and r through the keyboard during
execution. This can be achieved using a function called scanf( ).
This function is a counter-part of the printf( ) function. printf( )
outputs the values to the screen whereas scanf( ) receives them
from the keyboard. This is illustrated in the program shown below.
