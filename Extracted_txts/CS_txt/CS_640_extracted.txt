22 Let Us C

 

The first printf() outputs the message ‘Enter values of p, n, 1’ on
the screen. Here we have not used any expression in printf()
which means that using expressions in printf() is optional.

Note that the ampersand (&) before the variables in the scanf()
function is a must. & is an ‘Address of’ operator. It gives the
location number used by the variable in memory. When we say
&a, we are telling scanf( ) at which memory location should it
store the value supplied by the user from the keyboard. The
detailed working of the & operator would be taken up in Chapter
5.

Note that a blank, a tab or a new line must separate the values
supplied to scanf( ). Note that a blank is creating using a spacebar,
tab using the Tab key and new line using the Enter key. This is
shown below:

Ex.: The three values separated by blank

1000 5 15.5

Ex.: The three values separated by tab.
1000 5 15.5

Ex.: The three values separated by newline.
1000
5
15.5

So much for the tips. How about another program to give you a
feel of things...
