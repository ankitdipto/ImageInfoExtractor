C Instructions

Now that we have written a few programs let us look at the
instructions that we used in these programs. There are basically
three types of instructions in C:

(a) Type Declaration Instruction
(b) Arithmetic Instruction
(c) Control Instruction

The purpose of each of these instructions is given below:

(a) Type declaration instruction -— To declare the type of
variables used in a C
program.

(b) Arithmetic instruction — To perform arithmetic
operations between con-
stants and variables.

(c) Control instruction — To control the sequence of
execution of various state-
ments in a C program.

Since, the elementary C programs would usually contain only the
type declaration and the arithmetic instructions; we would discuss
only these two instructions at this stage. The other types of
instructions would be discussed in detail in the subsequent
chapters.
