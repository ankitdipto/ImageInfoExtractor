Type Declaration Instruction

This instruction is used to declare the type of variables being used
in the program. Any variable used in the program must be declared
before using it in any statement. The type declaration statement is
written at the beginning of main( ) function.

Ex.: int bas ;
float rs, grosssal ;
char name, code ;

There are several subtle variations of the type declaration
instruction. These are discussed below:

(a) While declaring the type of variable we can also initialize it as
shown below.

int i= 10, j= 25;
float a = 1.5, b = 1.99 + 2.4 * 1.44;

(b) The order in which we define the variables is sometimes
important sometimes not. For example,

inti = 10, j= 25;

is same as

intj = 25, j= 10;
However,

float a = 1.5, b= a+ 3.1;
is alright, but

float b=a+3.1,a=1.5;
