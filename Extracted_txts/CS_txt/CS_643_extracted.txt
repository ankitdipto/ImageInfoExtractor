Chapter 1: Getting Started 25

 

(c)

is not. This is because here we are trying to use a even before
defining it.

The following statements would work

inta, b, c,d;
a=b=c=10;

However, the following statement would not work
inta=b=c=d=10;

Once again we are trying to use b (to assign to a) before
defining it.

Arithmetic Instruction

A C arithmetic instruction consists of a variable name on the left
hand side of = and variable names & constants on the right hand
side of =. The variables and constants appearing on the right hand
side of = are connected by arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and /.

Ex. int ad;

float kot, deta, alpha, beta, gamma ;

ad = 3200 ;

kot = 0.0056 ;

deta = alpha * beta / gamma + 3.2*2/5;
Here,

*,/,-, t+ are the arithmetic operators.

= is the assignment operator.

2, 5 and 3200 are integer constants.

3.2 and 0.0056 are real constants.

ad is an integer variable.

kot, deta, alpha, beta, gamma are real variables.
