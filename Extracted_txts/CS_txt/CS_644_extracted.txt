26 Let Us C

 

The variables and constants together are called ‘operands’ that are
operated upon by the ‘arithmetic operators’ and the result is
assigned, using the assignment operator, to the variable on left-
hand side.

A C arithmetic statement could be of three types. These are as
follows:

(a) Integer mode arithmetic statement - This is an arithmetic
statement in which all operands are either integer variables or
integer constants.

Ex.: int i, king, issac, noteit ;
i=i+1;
king = issac * 234 + noteit - 7689 ;
(b) Real mode arithmetic statement - This is an arithmetic

statement in which all operands are either real constants or
teal variables.

Ex.: float qbee, antink, si, prin, anoy, roi ;
qbee = antink + 23.123 / 4.5 * 0.3442;
si = prin * anoy * roi / 100.0 ;

(c) Mixed mode arithmetic statement - This is an arithmetic
statement in which some of the operands are integers and
some of the operands are real.

Ex.: float si, prin, anoy, roi, avg ;
int a, b, c, num ;
si = prin * anoy * roi/ 100.0 ;
avg=(a+b+c+num)/4;

It is very important to understand how the execution of an
arithmetic statement takes place. Firstly, the right hand side is
evaluated using constants and the numerical values stored in the
variable names. This value is then assigned to the variable on the
left-hand side.
