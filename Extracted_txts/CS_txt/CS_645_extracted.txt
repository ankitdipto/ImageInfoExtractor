Though Arithmetic instructions look simple to use one often
commits mistakes in writing them. Let us take a closer look at
these statements. Note the following points carefully.

C allows only one variable on left-hand side of =. That is, z=
k * Lis legal, whereas k * 1 = z is illegal.

In addition to the division operator C also provides a modular
division operator. This operator returns the remainder on
dividing one integer with another. Thus the expression 10 / 2
yields 5, whereas, 10 % 2 yields 0. Note that the modulus
operator (%) cannot be applied on a float. Also note that on
using % the sign of the remainder is always same as the sign
of the numerator. Thus —5 % 2 yields —1, whereas, 5 % -2
yields 1.

An arithmetic instruction is often used for storing character
constants in character variables.

char a,b,d;
a=F';
b-C
d=

  

When we do this the ASCII values of the characters are stored
in the variables. ASCII values are used to represent any
character in memory. The ASCII values of ‘F’ and ‘G’ are 70
and 71 (refer the ASCII Table in Appendix E).

Arithmetic operations can be performed on ints, floats and
chars.

Thus the statements,

char x,y;
int Z;
