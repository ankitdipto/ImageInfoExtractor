Integer and Float Conversions

In order to effectively develop C programs, it will be necessary to
understand the rules that are used for the implicit conversion of
floating point and integer values in C. These are mentioned below.
Note them carefully.

(a) An arithmetic operation between an integer and integer
always yields an integer result.

(b) An operation between a real and real always yields a real
result.

(c) An operation between an integer and real always yields a real
result. In this operation the integer is first promoted to a real
and then the operation is performed. Hence the result is real.

I think a few practical examples shown in the following figure
would put the issue beyond doubt.

 

 

 

Operation Result Operation Result
5/2 2 2/5 0
5.0/2 2.5 2.0/5 04
5/20 2.5 2/5.0 04
5.0/2.0 2.5 2.0/5.0 04

Type Conversion in Assignments

It may so happen that the type of the expression and the type of the
variable on the left-hand side of the assignment operator may not
be same. In such a case the value of the expression is promoted or
