Note that though the following statements give the same result, 0,
the results are obtained differently.

 

k=2/9;
k=2.0/9;

In the first statement, since both 2 and 9 are integers, the result is
an integer, i.e. 0. This 0 is then assigned to k. In the second
statement 9 is promoted to 9.0 and then the division is performed.
Division yields 0.222222. However, this cannot be stored in k, k
being an int. Hence it gets demoted to 0 and then stored in k.

Hierarchy of Operations

While executing an arithmetic statement, which has two or more
operators, we may have some problems as to how exactly does it
get executed. For example, does the expression 2 * x - 3 * y
correspond to (2x)-(3y) or to 2(x-3y)? Similarly, does A / B * C
correspond to A / (B * C) or to (A / B) * C? To answer these
questions satisfactorily one has to understand the ‘hierarchy’ of
operations. The priority or precedence in which the operations in
