an arithmetic statement are performed is called the hierarchy of
operations. The hierarchy of commonly used operators is shown in
Figure 1.8.

Figure 1.8

Now a few tips about usage of operators in general.

(a) Within parentheses the same hierarchy as mentioned in Figure
1.11 is operative. Also, if there are more than one set of
parentheses, the operations within the innermost parentheses
would be performed first, followed by the operations within
the second innermost pair and so on.

(b) We must always remember to use pairs of parentheses. A
careless imbalance of the right and left parentheses is a
common error. Best way to avoid this error is to type () and
then type an expression inside it.

A few examples would clarify the issue further.

Example 1.1: Determine the hierarchy of operations and evaluate
the following expression:

i=2°3/4+4/4+8-2+5/8
Stepwise evaluation of this expression is shown below:

1=2°3/4+4/4+8-2+5/8
