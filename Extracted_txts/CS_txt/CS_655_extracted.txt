unambiguous. Unambiguous in what sense? It must not be
involved in evaluation of any other sub-expression. Similarly, in
case of Right to Left associativity the right operand must be
unambiguous. Let us understand this with an example.

Consider the expression
a=3/2*5;

Here there is a tie between operators of same priority, that is
between / and *. This tie is settled using the associativity of / and
* But both enjoy Left to Right associativity. Figure 1.10 shows for
each operator which operand is unambiguous and which is not.

 

 

 

Operator | Left Right Remark
/ 3 2 or 2 * | Left operand is
5 unambiguous, Right is not

 

* 3/2o0r2 | 5 Right operand is
unambiguous, Left is not

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.10

Since both / and * have L to R associativity and only / has
unambiguous left operand (necessary condition for L to R
associativity) it is performed earlier.

Consider one more expression
a=b=3;

Here both assignment operators have the same priority and same
associativity (Right to Left). Figure 1.11 shows for each operator
which operand is unambiguous and which is not.
