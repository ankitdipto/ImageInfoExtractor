Operator | Left Right Remark
= a borb=| Left operand is
3 unambiguous, Right is
not
= bora=b | 3 Right operand is
unambiguous, Left is not

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.11

Since both = have R to L associativity and only the second = has
unambiguous right operand (necessary condition for R to L
associativity) the second = is performed earlier.

Consider yet another expression
z=a*b+cld;

Here * and / enjoys same priority and same associativity (Left to
Right). Figure 1.12 shows for each operator which operand is
unambiguous and which is not.

 

 

Operator | Left | Right | Remark

 

* a b Both operands are unambiguous

 

/ c d Both operands are unambiguous

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.12

Here since left operands for both operators are unambiguous
Compiler is free to perform * or / operation as per its convenience
