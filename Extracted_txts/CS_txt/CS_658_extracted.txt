Control Instructions in C

As the name suggests the ‘Control Instructions’ enable us to
specify the order in which the various instructions in a program are
to be executed by the computer. In other words the control
instructions determine the ‘flow of control’ in a program. There
are four types of control instructions in C. They are:

(a) Sequence Control Instruction

(b) Selection or Decision Control Instruction
(c) Repetition or Loop Control Instruction
(d) Case Control Instruction

The Sequence control instruction ensures that the instructions are
executed in the same order in which they appear in the program.
Decision and Case control instructions allow the computer to take
a decision as to which instruction is to be executed next. The Loop
control instruction helps computer to execute a group of statements
repeatedly. In the following chapters we are going to learn these
instructions in detail. Try your hand at the Exercise presented on
the following pages before proceeding to the next chapter, which
discusses the decision control instruction.
