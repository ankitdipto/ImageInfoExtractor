p: all intermediate vertices in {1,2,...,k}

Figure 25.3 Path p is a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j, and k is the highest-numbered
intermediate vertex of p. Path p1, the portion of path p from vertex i to vertex k, has all intermediate
vertices in the set {1,2,...,k — 1}. The same holds for path p2 from vertex k to vertex j.

fore, p is a shortest path from i to k with all intermediate vertices in the set
{1,2,...,4 —1}. Similarly, p> is a shortest path from vertex k to vertex j with
all intermediate vertices in the set {1,2,...,k — 1}.

 

A recursive solution to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem

Based on the above observations, we define a recursive formulation of shortest-
path estimates that differs from the one in Section 25.1. Let di? be the weight
of a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j for which all intermediate vertices
are in the set {1,2,...,k}. When k = 0, a path from vertex i to vertex j with
no intermediate vertex numbered higher than 0 has no intermediate vertices at all.
Such a path has at most one edge, and hence d? = wij. Following the above

discussion, we define d\? recursively by

ra) Wij ifk =0,

oo 25.5

u min (df? de? +dk) ifk > 1. (25.5)
Because for any path, all intermediate vertices are in the set {1,2,...,}, the ma-

trix D™ = (a) gives the final answer: a” = 6(i, j) for alli, j eV.

Computing the shortest-path weights bottom up

Based on recurrence (25.5), we can use the following bottom-up procedure to com-
pute the values di in order of increasing values of k. Its input is an xn matrix W
defined as in equation (25.1). The procedure returns the matrix D) of shortest-
path weights.
