Chapter 2: The Decision Control Structure 51

 

Now let us learn each of these and their variations in turn.

The if Statement

Like most languages, C uses the keyword if to implement the
decision control instruction. The general form of if statement looks
like this:

if ( this condition is true )
execute this statement ;

The keyword if tells the compiler that what follows is a decision
control instruction. The condition following the keyword if is
always enclosed within a pair of parentheses. If the condition,
whatever it is, is true, then the statement is executed. If the
condition is not true then the statement is not executed; instead the
program skips past it. But how do we express the condition itself
in C? And how do we evaluate its truth or falsity? As a general
tule, we express a condition using C’s ‘relational’ operators. The
relational operators allow us to compare two values to see whether
they are equal to each other, unequal, or whether one is greater
than the other. Here’s how they look and how they are evaluated in
Cc.

 

 

 

this expression is true if

x=y xX is equal to y

x l=y X is not equal to y

x<y x is less thany

x>y X is greater than y

x<=y xX is less than or equal to y
xX>=y xX is greater than or equal to y
