52 Let Us C

 

The relational operators should be familiar to you except for the
equality operator == and the inequality operator !=. Note that = is
used for assignment, whereas, == is used for comparison of two
quantities. Here is a simple program, which demonstrates the use
of if and the relational operators.

/ Demonstration of if statement */
main()
{

int num;

printf ("Enter a number less than 10") ;
scanf ("%d", &num ) ;

if (num <= 10)
printf ("What an obedient servant you are !" ) ;
}

On execution of this program, if you type a number less than or
equal to 10, you get a message on the screen through printf( ). If
you type some other number the program doesnâ€™t do anything. The
following flowchart would help you understand the flow of control
in the program.
