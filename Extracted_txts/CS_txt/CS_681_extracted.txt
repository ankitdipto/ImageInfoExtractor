tot = (qty * rate ) - (qty * rate * dis / 100) ;
printf ( "Total expenses = Rs. %f", tot) ;
}

Here is some sample interaction with the program.

Enter quantity and rate 1200 15.50
Total expenses = Rs. 16740.000000

Enter quantity and rate 200 15.50
Total expenses = Rs. 3100.000000

In the first run of the program, the condition evaluates to true, as
1200 (value of qty) is greater than 1000. Therefore, the variable
dis, which was earlier set to 0, now gets a new value 10. Using this
new value total expenses are calculated and printed.

In the second run the condition evaluates to false, as 200 (the value
of qty) isnâ€™t greater than 1000. Thus, dis, which is earlier set to 0,
remains 0, and hence the expression after the minus sign evaluates
to zero, thereby offering no discount.

 

Is the statement dis = 0 necessary? The answer is yes, since in C, a
variable if not specifically initialized contains some unpredictable
value (garbage value).

The Real Thing

We mentioned earlier that the general form of the if statement is as
follows

if (condition )
statement ;

Truly speaking the general form is as follows:
