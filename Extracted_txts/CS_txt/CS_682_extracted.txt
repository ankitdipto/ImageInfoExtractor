56 Let Us C

 

if ( expression )

statement ;
Here the expression can be any valid expression including a
relational expression. We can even use arithmetic expressions in

the if statement. For example all the following if statements are
valid

if(3+2%5)
printf (â€œThis works" ) ;

if(a=10)
printf ("Even this works" ) ;

if(-5)
printf ("Surprisingly even this works" ) ;

Note that in C a non-zero value is considered to be true, whereas a
0 is considered to be false. In the first if, the expression evaluates
to 5 and since 5 is non-zero it is considered to be true. Hence the
printf() gets executed.

In the second if, 10 gets assigned to a so the if is now reduced to if
(a ) or if ( 10 ). Since 10 is non-zero, it is true hence again
printf() goes to work.

In the third if, -5 is a non-zero number, hence true. So again
printf() goes to work. In place of -5 even if a float like 3.14 were
used it would be considered to be true. So the issue is not whether
the number is integer or float, or whether it is positive or negative.
Issue is whether it is zero or non-zero.

Multiple Statements within if

It may so happen that in a program we want more than one
statement to be executed if the expression following if is satisfied.
If such multiple statements are to be executed then they must be
