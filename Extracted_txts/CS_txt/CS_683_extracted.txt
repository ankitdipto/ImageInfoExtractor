placed within a pair of braces as illustrated in the following
example.

Example 2.2: The current year and the year in which the
employee joined the organization are entered through the
keyboard. If the number of years for which the employee has
served the organization is greater than 3 then a bonus of Rs. 2500/-
is given to the employee. If the years of service are not greater
than 3, then the program should do nothing.

/* Calculation of bonus */
main()
{
int bonus, cy, yoj, yr_of_ser ;

printf ("Enter current year and year of joining " ) ;
scanf ("%d %d", &cy, &yoj) ;

yr_of_ser = cy - yoj;
if ( yr_of_ser > 3)

bonus = 2500 ;
printf ( "Bonus = Rs. %d", bonus ) ;

}

Observe that here the two statements to be executed on satisfaction
of the condition have been enclosed within a pair of braces. If a
pair of braces is not used then the C compiler assumes that the
programmer wants only the immediately next statement after the if
to be executed on satisfaction of the condition. In other words we
can say that the default scope of the if statement is the immediately
next statement after it.
