62 Let Us C

 

Note that the second if-else construct is nested in the first else
statement. If the condition in the first if statement is false, then the
condition in the second if statement is checked. If it is false as
well, then the final else statement is executed.

You can see in the program how each time a if-else construct is
nested within another if-else construct, it is also indented to add
clarity to the program. Inculcate this habit of indentation,
otherwise you would end up writing programs which nobody (you
included) can understand easily at a later date.

In the above program an if-else occurs within the else block of the
first if statement. Similarly, in some other program an if-else may

occur in the if block as well. There is no limit on how deeply the
ifs and the elses can be nested.

Forms of if
The if statement can take any of the following forms:

(a) _ if ( condition )

do this ;
(b) if ( condition )
{
do this ;
and this ;
}
(c)__ if ( condition )
do this ;
else
do this ;
(d)__ if ( condition )
{

do this ;
