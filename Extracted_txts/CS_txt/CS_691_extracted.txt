INPLICATION => (implies). A sentence such as (PA Q) = Ris called an implication (or conditional).

PREMISE Its premise or antecedent is P A Q, and its conclusion or consequent is R. Impli-

‘CONCLUSION cations are also known as rules or if-then statements. The implication symbol is
“sometimes written in other books as > or —.

EQUIVALENCE = (equivalent). The sentence (PA Q) < (QAP) is an equivalence (also called a
biconditional).

NEGATION — (not). A sentence such as —P is called the negation of P. All the other connectives
combine two sentences into one; — is the only connective that operates on a single
sentence. -

Figure 6.8 gives a formal grammar of propositional logic; see page 854 if you are not fa-
sromic SENTENCES ~—miliar with the BNF notation. The grammar introduces atomic sentences, which in propositional
SOUELEX logic consist ofa single symbol (e.g., P), and complex sentences, which contain connectives or
TITERAL parentheses (e.g., PA Q). The term literal is also used, meaning either an atomic sentences or a

  

negated atomic sentence.

Strictly speaking, the grammar is ambiguous — a sentence such as P A O V R could be
parsed as either (P A O) VR oras PA (OV R). This is similar to the ambiguity of arithmetic
expressions such as P + Ox R, and the way to resolve the ambiguity is also similar: we pick an
order of precedence for the operators, but use parentheses whenever there might be confusion.
The order of precedence in propositional logic is (from highest to lowest): =, A, V, >, and ©.
Hence, the sentence ~ -

 

“PVOAR=>S
is equivalent to the sentence

{(7P)V (QAR) = S.
