64 Let Us C

 

Use of Logical Operators

C allows usage of three logical operators, namely, &&, || and !.
These are to be read as ‘AND’ ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’ respectively.

There are several things to note about these logical operators. Most
obviously, two of them are composed of double symbols: || and
&&. Don’t use the single symbol | and &. These single symbols
also have a meaning. They are bitwise operators, which we would
examine in Chapter 14.

The first two operators, && and ||, allow two or more conditions
to be combined in an if statement. Let us see how they are used in
a program. Consider the following example.

Example 2.4: The marks obtained by a student in 5 different
subjects are input through the keyboard. The student gets a
division as per the following rules:

Percentage above or equal to 60 - First division
Percentage between 50 and 59 - Second division
Percentage between 40 and 49 - Third division
Percentage less than 40 - Fail

Write a program to calculate the division obtained by the student.

There are two ways in which we can write a program for this
example. These methods are given below.

/* Method - | */
main()
{
int m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, per ;

printf ("Enter marks in five subjects " ) ;
scanf ( "%d %d %d %d %d", &m1, &M2, &m3, &m4, &MS ) ;
per = (m1 +m2+m3+m4+m5)/5;
