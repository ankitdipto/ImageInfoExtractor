This is a straight forward program. Observe that the program uses
nested if-elses. This leads to three disadvantages:

(a) As the number of conditions go on increasing the level of
indentation also goes on increasing. As a result the whole

(b)
(c)

program creeps to the right.

Care needs to be exercised to match the corresponding ifs and

elses.

Care needs to be exercised to match the corresponding pair of

braces.

All these three problems can be eliminated by usage of ‘Logical
operators’. The following program illustrates this.

main()

{

int m1, m2, m3, m4, m6, per ;

printf ( “Enter marks in five subjects ") ;

scanf ("%d %d %d %d %d", &m1, &M2, &m3, &m4, &MS ) ;

per =(m1+m2+m3+m4+m5)/5;
