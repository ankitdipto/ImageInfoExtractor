68 Let Us C

 

to only two answers. For example, consider the following
example:

Example 2.5: A company insures its drivers in the following
cases:

— Ifthe driver is married.
— Ifthe driver is unmarried, male & above 30 years of age.
— Ifthe driver is unmarried, female & above 25 years of age.

In all other cases the driver is not insured. If the marital status, sex
and age of the driver are the inputs, write a program to determine
whether the driver is to be insured or not.

Here after checking a complicated set of instructions the final
output of the program would be one of the two—Either the driver
should be ensured or the driver should not be ensured. As
mentioned above, since these are the only two outcomes this
problem can be solved using logical operators. But before we do
that let us write a program that does not make use of logical
operators.

/* Insurance of driver - without using logical operators */

main()
char sex, ms;
int age;

printf ("Enter age, sex, marital status ") ;
scanf ("%d %c %c", &age, &Sex, &ms ) ;

if (ms == 'M’)

printf ( "Driver is insured” ) ;
else
{

if (ex == 'M')

{
