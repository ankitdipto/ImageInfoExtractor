if (age > 30)

printf ( "Driver is insured” ) ;

}

From the program it is evident that we are required to match
several ifs and elses and several pairs of braces. In a more real-life
situation there would be more conditions to check leading to the
program creeping to the right. Let us now see how to avoid these
problems by using logical operators.

As mentioned above, in this example we expect the answer to be
either ‘Driver is insured’ or ‘Driver is not insured’. If we list down
all those cases in which the driver is insured, then they would be:

(a) Driver is married.
(b) Driver is an unmarried male above 30 years of age.
(c) Driver is an unmarried female above 25 years of age.

Since all these cases lead to the driver being insured, they can be
combined together using && and || as shown in the program
below:

/" Insurance of driver - using logical operators */
main()
{

char sex, ms ;
