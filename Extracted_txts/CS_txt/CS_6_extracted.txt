Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths 645

Lemma 24.1 (Subpaths of shortest paths are shortest paths)

Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with weight function w : E > R,
let p = (Vo.V1..--. vx) be a shortest path from vertex Vo to vertex vg and, for any
i and j such thatO0 <i <j <k, let piy = (vi. Visi... vj) be the subpath of p
from vertex v; to vertex v;. Then, pj; is a shortest path from v; to v;.

Proof If we decompose path p into vo Roy, Ry vj Xs vz, then we have that
w(p) = w(Poi) + w(pij) + w(pjx). Now, assume that there is a path p/; from v;

Pi .
to v; with weight w(pi;) < w(pij). Then, vo Ry, AL vj id vx is a path from vo
to ve Whose weight w(po;) + w(p};) + w(pjx) is less than w(p), which contradicts
the assumption that p is a shortest path from vo to vg. .

Negative-weight edges

Some instances of the single-source shortest-paths problem may include edges
whose weights are negative. If the graph G = (V,£) contains no negative-
weight cycles reachable from the source s, then for all v € V, the shortest-path
weight 6(s,v) remains well defined, even if it has a negative value. If the graph
contains a negative-weight cycle reachable from s, however, shortest-path weights
are not well defined. No path from s to a vertex on the cycle can be a short-
est path—we can always find a path with lower weight by following the proposed
“shortest” path and then traversing the negative-weight cycle. If there is a negative-
weight cycle on some path from s to v, we define 6(s, v) = —oo.

Figure 24.1 illustrates the effect of negative weights and negative-weight cy-
cles on shortest-path weights. Because there is only one path from s to a (the
path (s,a)), we have 5(s,a) = w(s,a) = 3. Similarly, there is only one path
from s to b, and so 5(s,b) = w(s,a) + w(a,b) = 3 + (—4) = -1. There are
infinitely many paths from s to c: (s,c), (s.c,d.c), (s.c,d,c, d,c), and so on.
Because the cycle (c,d,c) has weight 6 + (—3) = 3 > 0, the shortest path from s
toc is (s,c), with weight 5(s,c) = w(s,c) = 5. Similarly, the shortest path from s
to d is (s,c,d), with weight 5(s,d) = w(s,c)+w(c,d) = 11. Analogously, there
are infinitely many paths from s to e: (s, e), (s,e. fie), (8,e, fie. fie), and so
on. Because the cycle (e, f, e) has weight 3 + (—6) = —3 < 0, however, there
is no shortest path from s to e. By traversing the negative-weight cycle (e, f. e)
arbitrarily many times, we can find paths from s to e with arbitrarily large negative
weights, and so 6(s,e) = —oo. Similarly, 5(s, f) = —oo. Because g is reachable
from f, we can also find paths with arbitrarily large negative weights from s to g,
and so (s, g) = —oo. Vertices h, i, and j also forma negative-weight cycle. They
are not reachable from s, however, and so 6(s,h) = 8(s,i) = 5(s, j) = 00.
