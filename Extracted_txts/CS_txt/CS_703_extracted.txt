The ! Operator

So far we have used only the logical operators && and ||. The
third logical operator is the NOT operator, written as !. This
operator reverses the result of the expression it operates on. For
example, if the expression evaluates to a non-zero value, then
applying ! operator to it results into a 0. Vice versa, if the
expression evaluates to zero then on applying ! operator to it
makes it 1, a non-zero value. The final result (after applying !) 0 or
1 is considered to be false or true respectively. Here is an example
of the NOT operator applied to a relational expression.

'(y<10)
This means “not y less than 10”. In other words, if y is less than
10, the expression will be false, since ( y < 10 ) is true. We can

express the same condition as ( y >= 10).

The NOT operator is often used to reverse the logical value of a
single variable, as in the expression
