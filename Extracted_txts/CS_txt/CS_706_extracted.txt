Chapter 2: The Decision Control Structure 75

 

if(i==5);
printf ( "You entered 5" ) ;
}

The ; makes the compiler to interpret the statement as if you have
written it in following manner:

if (i==5)
printf ("You entered 5") ;

Here, if the condition evaluates to true the ; (null statement, which
does nothing on execution) gets executed, following which the
printf( ) gets executed. If the condition fails then straightaway the
printf() gets executed. Thus, irrespective of whether the condition
evaluates to true or false the printf( ) is bound to get executed.
Remember that the compiler would not point out this as an error,
since as far as the syntax is concerned nothing has gone wrong, but
the logic has certainly gone awry. Moral is, beware of such
pitfalls.
