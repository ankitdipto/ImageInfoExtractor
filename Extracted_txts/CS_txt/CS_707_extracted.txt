The Conditional Operators

The conditional operators ? and : are sometimes called ternary
operators since they take three arguments. In fact, they form a kind
of foreshortened if-then-else. Their general form is,

expression 1 ? expression 2 : expression 3

What this expression says is: “if expression 1 is true (that is, if its
value is non-zero), then the value returned will be expression 2,
otherwise the value returned will be expression 3”. Let us
understand this with the help of a few examples:

(a) int xy;
scanf ("%d", &X)
y=(x>5273:4);

This statement will store 3 in y if x is greater than 5,
otherwise it will store 4 in y.

The equivalent if statement will be,

if(x>5)
y=3;
else
y=4;
(b) char a;
int y;
scanf ("%c", &a) ;
y =(a>= 65 && a <=9071:0);

Here 1 would be assigned to y if a >=65 && a <=90 evaluates to
true, otherwise 0 would be assigned.

The following points may be noted about the conditional
operators:
