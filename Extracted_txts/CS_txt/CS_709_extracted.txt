conditional operators and third way is to use the switch
statement.

The default scope of the if statement is only the next
statement. So, to execute more than one statement they must
be written in a pair of braces.

An if block need not always be associated with an else block.
However, an else block is always associated with an if
statement.

If the outcome of an if-else ladder is only one of two answers
then the ladder should be replaced either with an else-if clause
or by logical operators.

&& and || are binary operators, whereas, ! is a unary operator.
In C every test expression is evaluated in terms of zero and
non-zero values. A zero value is considered to be false and a
non-zero value is considered to be true.

Assignment statements used with conditional operators must
be enclosed within a pair of parenthesis.
