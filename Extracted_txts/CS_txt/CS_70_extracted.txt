Figure 25.5 shows the matrices 7 computed by the TRANSITIVE-CLOSURE
procedure on a sample graph. The TRANSITIVE-CLOSURE procedure, like the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm, runs in @(73) time. On some computers, though, log-
ical operations on single-bit values execute faster than arithmetic operations on
integer words of data. Moreover, because the direct transitive-closure algorithm
uses only boolean values rather than integer values, its space requirement is less
