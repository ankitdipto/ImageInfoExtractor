84 Let Us C

 

(k) Given the coordinates (x, y) of a center of a circle and it’s radius,
write a program which will determine whether a point lies inside
the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.

(Hint: Use sqrt() and pow( ) functions)

(I) Given a point (x, y), write a program to find out if it lies on the
X-axis, y-axis or at the origin, viz. (0, 0).

Logical Operators

If a = 10, b = 12, c = 0, find the values of the expressions in
the following table:

 

Expression Value

 

a!l=6 &&b>5 1
a==9||b<3
!(a<10)
W(a>5 &&c)
5 && c!=8 |) !c

 

 

 

[D] What would be the output of the following programs:

(a) main()

 

int i= 4,2=12;
if (i=5 |] z> 50)

printf ( "\nDean of students affairs" ) ;
else

printf ("\nDosa”) ;

 

}

(b) main()
{
int i= 4,2=12;
