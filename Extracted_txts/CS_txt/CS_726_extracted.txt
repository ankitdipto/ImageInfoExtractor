If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the
keyboard, write a program to check whether the triangle is
valid or not. The triangle is valid if the sum of two sides is
greater than the largest of the three sides.

If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the
keyboard, write a program to check whether the triangle is
isosceles, equilateral, scalene or right angled triangle.

In a company, worker efficiency is determined on the basis of
the time required for a worker to complete a particular job. If
the time taken by the worker is between 2 — 3 hours, then the
worker is said to be highly efficient. If the time required by
the worker is between 3 — 4 hours, then the worker is ordered
to improve speed. If the time taken is between 4 — 5 hours, the
worker is given training to improve his speed, and if the time
taken by the worker is more than 5 hours, then the worker has
to leave the company. If the time taken by the worker is input
through the keyboard, find the efficiency of the worker.

A university has the following rules for a student to qualify
for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the
subsidiary subject:

(a) He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or
more in B.

(b) If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or
more in B. However, he should get at least 45 percent in
A.

(c) If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more
in A he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to
qualify.

(d) In all other cases he is declared to have failed.

Write a program to receive marks in A and B and Output
whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to
reappear in B.
