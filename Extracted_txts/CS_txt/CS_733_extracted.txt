98 Let Us C

 

These programs were of limited nature, because when executed,
they always performed the same series of actions, in the same way,
exactly once. Almost always, if something is worth doing, it’s
worth doing more than once. You can probably think of several
examples of this from real life, such as eating a good dinner or
going for a movie. Programming is the same; we frequently need
to perform an action over and over, often with variations in the
details each time. The mechanism, which meets this need, is the
‘loop’, and loops are the subject of this chapter.

Loops

The versatility of the computer lies in its ability to perform a set of
instructions repeatedly. This involves repeating some portion of
the program either a specified number of times or until a particular
condition is being satisfied. This repetitive operation is done
through a loop control instruction.

There are three methods by way of which we can repeat a part of a
program. They are:

(a) Using a for statement
(b) Using a while statement
(c) Using a do-while statement

Each of these methods is discussed in the following pages.

The while Loop

It is often the case in programming that you want to do something
a fixed number of times. Perhaps you want to calculate gross
salaries of ten different persons, or you want to convert
temperatures from centigrade to fahrenheit for 15 different cities.
