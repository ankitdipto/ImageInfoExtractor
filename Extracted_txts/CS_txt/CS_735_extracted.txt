directly to truth and falsehood, that is, the label for a row in a truth table. Then the models of
a sentence are just those mappings that make the sentence true. The two views can easily be
reconciled because each possible assignment of true and false to a set of proposition symbols
can be viewed as an equivalence class of worlds that, under a given interpretation, have those
truth values for those symbols. There may of course be many different "real worlds" that have
the same truth values for those symbols. The only requirement to complete the reconciliation is
that each proposition symbol be either true orfalse in each world. This is, of course, the basic
ontological assumption of propositional logic, and is what allows us to expect that manipulations
of symbols lead to conclusions with reliable counterparts in the actual world.

Rules of inference for propositional logic

The process by which the soundness of an inference is established through truth tables can be
extended to entire classes of inferences. There are certain patterns of inferences that occur over
and over again, and their soundness can be shown once and for all. Then the pattern can be
captured in what is called an inference rule. Once a rule is established, it can be used to make
inferences without going through the tedious process of building truth tables

which emphasizes that this is not a sentence, but rather an inference rule. Whenever something in
the knowledge base matches the pattern above the line, the inference rule concludes the premise
