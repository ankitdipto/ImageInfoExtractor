100 Let Us C

 

while (count <= 3)

{
printf ( "\nEnter values of p, n andr") ;
scanf ("%d %d %f", &p, &n, &r ) ;
si=p*n*r/100;
printf ("Simple interest = Rs. %f", si ) ;
count = count +1 ;

}

}

And here are a few sample runs...

Enter values of p,n andr 1000 5 13.5
Simple interest = Rs. 675.000000

Enter values of p,n andr 2000 5 13.5
Simple interest = Rs. 1350.000000
Enter values of p, n andr 3500 5 3.5
Simple interest = Rs. 612.500000

The program executes all statements after the while 3 times. The
logic for calculating the simple interest is written within a pair of
braces immediately after the while keyword. These statements
form what is called the ‘body’ of the while loop. The parentheses
after the while contain a condition. So long as this condition
remains true all statements within the body of the while loop keep
getting executed repeatedly. To begin with the variable count is
initialized to 1 and every time the simple interest logic is executed
the value of count is incremented by one. The variable count is
many a times called either a ‘loop counter’ or an ‘index variable’.

The operation of the while loop is illustrated in the following
figure.
