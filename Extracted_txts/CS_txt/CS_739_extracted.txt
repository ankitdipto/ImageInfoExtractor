102 Let Us C

 

condition becomes false, the control passes to the first
statement that follows the body of the while loop.

In place of the condition there can be any other valid
expression. So long as the expression evaluates to a non-zero
value the statements within the loop would get executed.

— The condition being tested may use relational or logical
operators as shown in the following examples:

while (i <= 10)
while (i >= 10 && j <= 15)
while (j > 10 && (b< 15 || c< 20))

— The statements within the loop may be a single line or a block
of statements. In the first case the parentheses are optional. For
example,

while (i <= 10)
i=i+1;
is same as

while (i <= 10)
{

}

— Asa tule the while must test a condition that will eventually
become false, otherwise the loop would be executed forever,
indefinitely.

i=i+1;

main()

{
int i=1;
while (i <= 10)

printf (“%d\n", i) ;
