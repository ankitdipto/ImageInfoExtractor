Chapter 3: The Loop Control Structure 103

This is an indefinite loop, since i remains equal to 1 forever.
The correct form would be as under:

main()

{
int i=1;
while (i <= 10)

printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
}
}
— Instead of incrementing a loop counter, we can even decrement
it and still manage to get the body of the loop executed
repeatedly. This is shown below:

main()

int i=5;
while (i>=1)
{
printf ( "\nMake the computer literate!” ) ;
i=i-1;
}
}
— It is not necessary that a loop counter must only be an int. It
can even be a float.

main()

float a= 10.0;
while (a <= 10.5)

printf ("\nRaindrops on roses..." ) ;
printf ("...and whiskers on kittens" ) ;
a=a+0.1;
