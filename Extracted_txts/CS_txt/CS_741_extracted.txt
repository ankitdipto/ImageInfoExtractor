Even floating point loop counters can be decremented. Once
again the increment and decrement could be by any value, not
necessarily 1.

What do you think would be the output of the following
program?

main()

{
int i=1;
while (i <= 32767 )
{

printf (“%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
}
}

No, it doesn’t print numbers from 1 to 32767. It’s an
indefinite loop. To begin with, it prints out numbers from 1 to
32767. After that value of i is incremented by 1, therefore it
tries to become 32768, which falls outside the valid integer
range, so it goes to other side and becomes -32768 which
would certainly satisfy the condition in the while. This
process goes on indefinitely.

What will be the output of the following program?

main()

{
int i=1;
while (i<= 10);
{

printf ("“%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
