Chapter 3: The Loop Control Structure 105

 

This is another indefinite loop, and it doesn’t give any output
at all. The reason is, we have carelessly given a ; after the
while. This would make the loop work like this...

while (i <= 10)
( i
printf (“%d\n", i) ;

i=i+1;

}

Since the value of i is not getting incremented the control
would keep rotating within the loop, eternally. Note that
enclosing printf( ) and i = i+1 within a pair of braces is not
an error. In fact we can put a pair of braces around any
individual statement or set of statements without affecting the
execution of the program.

More Operators

There are variety of operators which are frequently used with
while. To illustrate their usage let us consider a problem wherein
numbers from 1 to 10 are to be printed on the screen. The program
for performing this task can be written using while in the
following different ways:

(a)

main()

{
int i=1;
while (i <= 10)

printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
