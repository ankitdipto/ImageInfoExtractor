106 Let Us C

 

(b) main()
{
int i=1;
while (i <= 10)
{
printf ("%d\n", i) ;
i++;
}
}

Note that the increment operator ++ increments the value of i
by 1, every time the statement i++ gets executed. Similarly, to
reduce the value of a variable by 1 a decrement operator -- is
also available.

However, never use nt+++ to increment the value of n by 2,
since C doesn’t recognize the operator +++.

(c) main()
{
int i=1;
while (i <= 10)
{

printf (“%d\n", i) ;
it=1;
}
}

Note that += is a compound assignment operator. It
increments the value of i by 1. Similarly, j = j + 10 can also
be written as j += 10. Other compound assignment operators
are -=, *=,/=and %=.

(d) main()
{
int i=0;
while (i++ < 10)
