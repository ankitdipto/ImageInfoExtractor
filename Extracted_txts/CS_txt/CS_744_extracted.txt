Chapter 3: The Loop Control Structure 107

 

printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
}

In the statement while ( i++ < 10 ), firstly the comparison of
value of i with 10 is performed, and then the incrementation
of i takes place. Since the incrementation of i happens after its
usage, here the ++ operator is called a post-incrementation
operator. When the control reaches printf( ), i has already
been incremented, hence i must be initialized to 0.

main()
{
int i=0;
while (++i <= 10)
printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
}

In the statement while ( ++i <= 10 ), firstly incrementation of
i takes place, then the comparison of value of i with 10 is
performed. Since the incrementation of i happens before its
usage, here the ++ operator is called a pre-incrementation
operator.

The for Loop

Perhaps one reason why few programmers use while is that they
are too busy using the for, which is probably the most popular
looping instruction. The for allows us to specify three things about
a loop ina single line:

(a)
()

()

Setting a loop counter to an initial value.

Testing the loop counter to determine whether its value has
reached the number of repetitions desired.

Increasing the value of loop counter each time the program
segment within the loop has been executed.
