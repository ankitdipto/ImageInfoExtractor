below the line. The letters a, ;3, etc., are intended to match any sentence, not just individual
proposition symbols. If there are several sentences, in either the premise or the conclusion, they
are separated by commas. Figure 6.13 gives a list of seven commonly used inference rules. ~

An inference rule is sound if the conclusion is true in all cases where the premises are true.
To verify soundness, we therefore construct a truth table with one line for each possible model
ofthe proposition symbols in the premise, and show that in all models where the premise is true,
the conclusion is also true. Figure 6,14 shows the truth table for the resolution rule

premise of the implication, you can infer the conclusion.)

else at all.)

Resolution: (This is the most difficult. Because 0 cannot be both true and false,
one of the other disjuncts must be true in one of the premises. Or equivalently,
implication is transitive.)

Figure 6.13 Seven inference rules for propositional logic. The unit resolution rule is a special
case of the resolution ule, which in tum is a special case of the full resolution rule for first-order
Togic discussed in Chapter 9.
