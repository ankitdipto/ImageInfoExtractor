110 Let Us C

 

If this program is compared with the one written using while, it
can be seen that the three steps—initialization, testing and
incrementation—required for the loop construct have now been
incorporated in the for statement.

Let us now examine how the for statement gets executed:

— When the for statement is executed for the first time, the value
of count is set to an initial value 1.

— Now the condition count <= 3 is tested. Since count is 1 the
condition is satisfied and the body of the loop is executed for
the first time.

— Upon reaching the closing brace of for, control is sent back to
the for statement, where the value of count gets incremented
by 1.

— Again the test is performed to check whether the new value of
count exceeds 3.

— If the value of count is still within the range 1 to 3, the
statements within the braces of for are executed again.

— The body of the for loop continues to get executed till count
doesn’t exceed the final value 3.

— When count reaches the value 4 the control exits from the loop
and is transferred to the statement (if any) immediately after
the body of for.

The following figure would help in further clarifying the concept
of execution of the for loop.
