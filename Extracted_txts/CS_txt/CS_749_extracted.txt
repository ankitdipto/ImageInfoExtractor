Translation to Binary

The translation of the symbolic program into binary is done by a special
program called an assembler. The tasks performed by the assembler will be
better understood if we first perform the translation on paper. The translation
of the symbolic program of Table 68 into an equivalent binary code may be
done by scanning the program and replacing the symbols by their machine
code binary equivalent. Starting from the first line, we encounter an ORG
pseudoinstruction. This tells us to start the binary program from hexadecimal
location 100. The second line has two symbols. It must be a memory-reference
instruction to be placed in location 100. Since the letter I is missing, the first
bit of the instruction code must be 0. The symbolic name of the operation is
LDA. Checking Table 6-1 we find that the first hexadecimal digit of the instruc-
tion should be 2. The binary value of the address part must be obtained from
the address symbol SUB. We scan the label column and find this symbol in line
9. To determine its hexadecimal value we note that line 2 contains an instruc-
tion for location 100 and every other line specifies a machine instruction or an
operand for sequential memory locations. Counting lines, we find that label
SUBin line 9 corresponds to memory location 107. So the hexadecimal address
of the instruction LDA must be 107. When the two parts of the instruction are
assembled, we obtain the hexadecimal code 2107. The other lines representing
machine instructions are translated in a similarfashion and their hexadecimal
code is listed in Table 6-9.

Two linesin the symbolic program specify decimal operands with the
pseudoinstruction DEC. A third specifies a zero by means of a HEX pseudo-
instruction (DEC could be used as well). Decimal 83 is converted to binary and
placed in location 106 in its hexadecimal equivalent. Decimal —23 is a negative
number and must be converted into binary in signed-2's complement form.
