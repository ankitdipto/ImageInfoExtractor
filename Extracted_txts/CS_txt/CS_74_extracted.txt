25.3 Johnson's algorithm for sparse graphs 701

that allows us to use the same method. The new set of edge weights @ must satisfy
two important properties:

1. For all pairs of vertices u,v € V,a path p is a shortest path from u to v using
weight function w if and only if p is also a shortest path from u to v using
weight function 0.

2. For all edges (u,v), the new weight t(u, v) is nonnegative.

As we shall see in a moment, we can preprocess G to determine the new weight
function @ in O(VE) time.

Preserving shortest paths by reweighting

The following lemma shows how easily we can reweight the edges to satisfy the
first property above. We use 6 to denote shortest-path weights derived from weight
function w and 6 to denote shortest-path weights derived from weight function #0.

Lemma 25.1 (Reweighting does not change shortest paths)

Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with weight function w : E > R,
let h : V — R be any function mapping vertices to real numbers. For each edge
(u,v) € E, define

w(u,v) = wu,v) +h(u) —h(v). (25.9)
Let p = (Vo, Vi, +++ 5 vz) be any path from vertex vp to vertex vg. Then p is a
shortest path from vo to v; with weight function w if and only if it is a shortest path
with weight function W. That is, w(p) = 5(vo, vg) if and only if O(p) = 3(vo. Vy).
Furthermore, G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function w if and only
if G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function 0.

Proof We start by showing that

O(p) = w(p) + h(v9) — h(v,) - (25.10)
