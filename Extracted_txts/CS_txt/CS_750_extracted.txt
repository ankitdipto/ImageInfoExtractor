It is important to note that the initialization, testing an
incrementation part of a for loop can be replaced by any vali
expression. Thus the following for loops are perfectly ok.

 

  

for (i= 10;i;i--)
printf ("%d", i) ;
for (i<4;j=5;j=0)

printf ("%d", i) ;
for (i= 1; i <=10 ; printf ("%d"i++ )

 

for (‘scant ("96d" &i) ;i <= 10; i++)
printf ("3%d", i) ;

Let us now write down the program to print numbers from 1 to 10
in different ways. This time we would use a for loop instead of a
while loop.
