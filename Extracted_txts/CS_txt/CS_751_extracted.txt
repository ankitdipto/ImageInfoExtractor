(a)

(

main()
{
int i;
for (i=1;i<=10;i=i+1)
printf (“%d\n", i) ;
}

Note that the initialisation, testing and incrementation of loop
counter is done in the for statement itself. Instead of i=i+ 1,
the statements i++ or i += 1 can also be used.

Since there is only one statement in the body of the for loop,
the pair of braces have been dropped. As with the while, the
default scope of for is the immediately next statement after
for.

main()
{
int i;
for (i=1;i<=10;)
{
printf (“%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
}
}

Here, the incrementation is done within the body of the for
loop and not in the for statement. Note that inspite of this the
semicolon after the condition is necessary.

main()
{
int i=1;
for (;i<=10;i=i+1)
printf (“%d\n", i) ;
