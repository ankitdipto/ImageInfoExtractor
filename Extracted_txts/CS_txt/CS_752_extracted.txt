Here the initialisation is done in the declaration statement
itself, but still the semicolon before the condition is necessary.

main()
{
int i=1;
for (;i<=10;)
{
printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1;
}
}

Here, neither the initialisation, nor the incrementation is done
in the for statement, but still the two semicolons are
necessary.

main()
{
int i;
for (i=0;i++<10;)
printf ( "%d\n", i) ;
}

Here, the comparison as well as the incrementation is done
through the same statement, it+ < 10. Since the ++ operator
comes after i firstly comparison is done, followed by
incrementation. Note that it is necessary to initialize i to 0.

main()
{
int i;
for (i=0;++i<=10;)
printf ("%d\n", i) ;
