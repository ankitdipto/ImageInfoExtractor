114 Let Us C

 

Here, both, the comparison and the incrementation is done
through the same statement, ++i <= 10. Since ++ precedes i
firstly incrementation is done, followed by comparison. Note
that it is necessary to initialize i to 0.

Nesting of Loops
The way if statements can be nested, similarly whiles and fors can
also be nested. To understand how nested loops work, look at the

program given below:

/" Demonstration of nested loops */

main()
{
int rc, sum;
for (r=1;1<=3;1++) /* outer loop */
{
for (c=1;c¢<=2;c++) /*“inner loop */
{
sum =1+C;
printf ( "r = %d c = %d sum = %d\n", r, c, sum) ;
}
}

When you run this program you will get the following output:

r=1c=1sum=2
r=1c=2sum=3
r=2c=1sum=3
r=2c=2sum=4
r=3c=1sum=4
r=3c=2sum=5

Here, for each value of r the inner loop is cycled through twice,
with the variable c taking values from 1 to 2. The inner loop
