The Odd Loop

The loops that we have used so far executed the statements within
them a finite number of times. However, in real life programming
one comes across a situation when it is not known beforehand how
many times the statements in the loop are to be executed. This
situation can be programmed as shown below:

/" Execution of a loop an unknown number of times */
main()

char another ;
int num ;
do
{
printf
scanf

"Enter a number") ;

"%d", &num) ;
printf ( "square of %d is %d", num, num * num) ;
printf ( "\nWant to enter another number y/n ") ;
scanf (" %c", &another ) ;

}while (another =='y') ;

}
And here is the sample output...

Enter a number 5
square of 5 is 25
Want to enter another number y/n y
Enter a number 7
square of 7 is 49
Want to enter another number y/n n

In this program the do-while loop would keep getting executed till
the user continues to answer y. The moment he answers n, the loop
terminates, since the condition ( another == 'y' ) fails. Note that
this loop ensures that statements within it are executed at least
once even if n is supplied first time itself.
