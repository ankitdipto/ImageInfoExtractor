The break Statement

We often come across situations where we want to jump out of a
loop instantly, without waiting to get back to the conditional test.
The keyword break allows us to do this. When break is
encountered inside any loop, control automatically passes to the
first statement after the loop. A break is usually associated with an
if. As an example, let’s consider the following example.

Example: Write a program to determine whether a number is
prime or not. A prime number is one, which is divisible only by 1
or itself.

All we have to do to test whether a number is prime or not, is to
divide it successively by all numbers from 2 to one less than itself.
If remainder of any of these divisions is zero, the number is not a
prime. If no division yields a zero then the number is a prime
number. Following program implements this logic.

main()
{
int num, i;

printf (“Enter a number" ) ;
scanf ("%d", &num ) ;

i=2;
while (i <= num - 1)
{
if (num %i==0)
{
printf ("Not a prime number" ) ;
break ;
}
i++;
