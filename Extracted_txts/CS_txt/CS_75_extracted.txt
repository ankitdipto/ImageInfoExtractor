Chapter 25 All-Pairs Shortest Paths

Therefore, any path p from vo to vg has W(p) = w(p) + h(vo) — h(vg). Be-
cause (vp) and h(vg) do not depend on the path, if one path from vo to vg is
shorter than another using weight function w, then it is also shorter using ©. Thus,
w(p) = 8(vo, vg) if and only if O(p) = (vo. Vy).

Finally, we show that G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function w if
and only if G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function #. Consider any

cycle ¢ = (V9. Vy....5 Ve), Where V9 = vz. By equation (25.10),
Wc) = wc) +h(vo) — A(z)
= wc),

and thus ¢ has negative weight using w if and only if it has negative weight us-
ing 0. /

Producing nonnegative weights by reweighting

Our next goal is to ensure that the second property holds: we want W(u,v) to be
nonnegative for all edges (u,v) € E. Given a weighted, directed graph G =
(V, E) with weight function w : E — R, we make a new graph G! = (V’, E’),
where V’ = V U {s} for some new vertex s ¢ V and E’ = E U{(s,v): ve V}.
We extend the weight function w so that w(s,v) = 0 for all v € V. Note that
because s has no edges that enter it, no shortest paths in G’, other than those with
source 5, contain s. Moreover, G’ has no negative-weight cycles if and only if G
has no negative-weight cycles. Figure 25.6(a) shows the graph G’ corresponding
to the graph G of Figure 25.1.

Now suppose that G and G’ have no negative-weight cycles. Let us define
h(v) = 4(s,v) for all v € V’. By the triangle inequality (Lemma 24.10),
we have h(v) < h(u) + w(u,v) for all edges (u,v) € E’. Thus, if we de-
fine the new weights W by reweighting according to equation (25.9), we have
W(u,v) = wu, v) + h(w) —h(v) = 0, and we have satisfied the second property.
Figure 25.6(b) shows the graph G’ from Figure 25.6(a) with reweighted edges.

Computing all-pairs shortest paths

Johnson’s algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest paths uses the Bellman-Ford al-
gorithm (Section 24.1) and Dijkstra’s algorithm (Section 24.3) as subroutines. It
assumes implicitly that the edges are stored in adjacency lists. The algorithm re-
turns the usual |V| x |V| matrix D = dj, where dj; = 6(i, j), or it reports that
the input graph contains a negative-weight cycle. As is typical for an all-pairs
shortest-paths algorithm, we assume that the vertices are numbered from | to |V|.
