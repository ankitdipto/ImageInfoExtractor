120 Let Us C

 

}

In this program when j equals 150, break takes the control outside
the inner while only, since it is placed inside the inner while.

The continue Statement

In some programming situations we want to take the control to the
beginning of the loop, bypassing the statements inside the loop,
which have not yet been executed. The keyword continue allows
us to do this. When continue is encountered inside any loop,
control automatically passes to the beginning of the loop.

A continue is usually associated with an if. As an example, let's
consider the following program.

main()
{
int ij;
for (i=1;i<=2;i++)
{
for (j=1;j<=2; j++)
{
if (i==j)
continue ;
printf ( â€œ\n%d %d\n", i,j);
}
}

}
The output of the above program would be...
