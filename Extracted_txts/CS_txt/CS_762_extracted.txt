Chapter 3: The Loop Control Structure 121

 

Note that when the value of i equals that of j, the continue
statement takes the control to the for loop (inner) bypassing rest of
the statements pending execution in the for loop (inner).

The do-while Loop

The do-while loop looks like this:

do

{
this ;
and this ;
and this ;
and this ;

} while ( this condition is true ) ;

There is a minor difference between the working of while and do-
while loops. This difference is the place where the condition is
tested. The while tests the condition before executing any of the
statements within the while loop. As against this, the do-while
tests the condition after having executed the statements within the
loop. Figure 3.5 would clarify the execution of do-while loop still
further.
