Chapter 3: The Loop Control Structure 123

 

Here, since the condition fails the first time itself, the printf() will
not get executed at all. Let's now write the same program using a
do-while loop.

main()
{
do
printf ("Hello there \n") ;
}while (4<1);
}

In this program the printf( ) would be executed once, since first
the body of the loop is executed and then the condition is tested.

There are some occasions when we want to execute a loop at least
once no matter what. This is illustrated in the following example:

break and continue are used with do-while just as they would be
in a while or a for loop. A break takes you out of the do-while
bypassing the conditional test. A continue sends you straight to
the test at the end of the loop.
