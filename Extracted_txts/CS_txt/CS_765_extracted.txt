The three type of loops available in C are for, while, and do-
while.

A break statement takes the execution control out of the loop.
A continue statement skips the execution of the statements
after it and takes the control to the beginning of the loop.

A do-while loop is used to ensure that the statements within
the loop are executed at least once.

The ++ operator increments the operand by 1, whereas, the --
operator decrements it by 1.

The operators +=, -=, *=, /=, %= are compound assignment
operators. They modify the value of the operand to the left of
them.

What would be the output of the following programs:

main()
{
int j;
while (j <= 10)
{
printf ( "\n%d", j) ;
Jaj+1;
}
}

main()
{
int i=1;
while (i<= 10);
{
printf ( “\n%d", i) ;
