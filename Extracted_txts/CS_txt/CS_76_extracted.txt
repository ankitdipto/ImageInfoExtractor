25.3 Johnson's algorithm for sparse graphs 703

 

Figure 25.6 Johnson’s all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm run on the graph of Figure 25.1. Ver-
tex numbers appear outside the vertices. (a) The graph G’ with the original weight function w.
The new vertex s is black. Within each vertex v is h(v) = 6(s,v). (b) After reweighting each
edge (u,v) with weight function (u,v) = w(w.v) + h(w) —h(v). (}-(g) The result of running
Dijkstra’s algorithm on each vertex of G using weight function @. In each part, the source vertex w
is black, and shaded edges are in the shortest-paths tree computed by the algorithm, Within each
vertex v are the values 5(w, v) and 5(w, v), separated by a slash. The value duy = 5(u, v) is equal to
3(u,v) + h(v) — h(u).
