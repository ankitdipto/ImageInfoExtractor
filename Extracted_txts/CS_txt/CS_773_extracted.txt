Representation of Symbolic Program in Memory

Prior to starting the assembly process, the symbolic program must be stored
in memory. The user types the symbolic program on a terminal. A loader
program is used to input the characters of the symbolic program into memory.
Since the program consists of symbols, its representation in memory must use
an alphanumeric character code. In the basic computer, each character is
represented by an8-bitcode. The high-order bit isalways Oand the other seven
bits are as specified by ASI. The hexadecimal equivalent of the character set
is listed in Table 6-10. Each character is assigned two hexadecimal digits which
can be easily converted to their equivalent 8-bit code. The last entry in the table
does not print a character but is associated with the physical movement of the
cursor in the terminal. The code for CR is produced when the return key
is depressed. This causes the “carriage” to return to its initial position to start
typing a new line. The assembler recognizes a CR code as the end of a line of
code.

‘Aline of code is stored in consecutive memory locations with two char-
acters in each location. Two characters can be stored in each word since a
memory word has a capacity of 16 bits. A label symbol is terminated with a
comma, Operation and address symbols are terminated with a space and the
end of the line is recognized by the CR code. For example, the following line
of code:
