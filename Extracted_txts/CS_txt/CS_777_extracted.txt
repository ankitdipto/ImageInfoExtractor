1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

(k) A machine is purchased which will produce earning of Rs.
1000 per year while it lasts. The machine costs Rs. 6000 and
will have a salvage of Rs. 2000 when it is condemned. If 12
percent per annum can be earned on alternate investments
what would be the minimum life of the machine to make it a
more attractive investment compared to alternative
investment?

(1) When interest compounds q times per year at an annual rate of
r % for n years, the principle p compounds to an amount a as per
the following formula

a=p(1+r/q)â„¢4

Write a program to read 10 sets of p, r, n & q and calculate
the corresponding as.

(m
