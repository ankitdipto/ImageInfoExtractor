Rosenblatt proved the famous perceptron convergence theorem, showing that his learning
algorithm could adjust the connection strengths of a perceptron to match any input data, provided
such a match existed. These topics are covered in Section 19.3

A dose of reality (1966-1974)

From the beginning, AI researchers were not shy in making predictions of their coming successes.
The following statement by Herbert Simon in 1957 is often quoted:

It is not my aim to surprise or shock you—but the simplest way I can summarize is to say
that there are now in the world machines that think, that leam and that create. Moreover, their
ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until—in a visible future—the range of
problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which human mind has been
applied.

Although one might argue that terms such as "visible future" can be interpreted in various ways,
some of Simon's predictions were more concrete. In 1958, he predicted that within 10 years
a computer would be chess champion, and an important new mathematical theorem would be
proved by machine. Claims such as these turned out to be wildly optimistic. The barrier that
faced almost all AI research projects was that methods that sufficed for demonstrations on one or
two simple examples turned out to fail miserably when tried out on wider selections of problems
and on more difficult problems.

The first kind of difficulty arose because early programs often contained little or no
knowledge of their subject matter, and succeeded by means of simple syntactic manipulations
Weizenbaum's ELIZA program (1965), which could apparently engage in serious conversation
