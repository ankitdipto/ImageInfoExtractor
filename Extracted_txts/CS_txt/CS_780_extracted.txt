can house a wumpus. The agent needs to know this for each square in the world, but here wejust
show sentences for three relevant squares, labeling each sentence with a rule number:

Res Si 4 = WW AW 2 AW)

Rot Sz) = AW AWa1 A 2W22 AAW

R32 S12 = AW ATW 2 ATW AW 3
Another useful fact is that ifthere is a stench in [1,2], then there must be a wumpus in [1,2] or in
one or more of the neighboring squares. This fact can be represented by the sentence

Ras Siz => WisVWi2V Wo2V Wi

Finding the wumpus
Given these sentences, we will now show how an agent can mechanically conclude W, 3. All the
agent has to do is construct the truth table for KB => W,, to show that this sentence is valid.
There are 12 propositional symbols,'° so the truth table will have 2'? = 4096 rows, and every
row in which the sentence KB is true also has W, 3 true. Rather than show all 4096 rows, we use
inference rules instead, but it is important to recognize that we could have done it in one (long)
step just by following the truth-table algorithm.
First, we will show that the wumpus is not in one ofthe other squares, and then conclude
by elimination that it must be in [1,3]:
1. Applying Modus Ponens with —$,,, and the sentence labelled R;, we obtain
AW A aWi2 AAW
2. Applying And-Elimination to this, we obtain the three separate sentences
Wi Wirz Wa
