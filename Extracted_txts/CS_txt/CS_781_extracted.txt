required to make a choice between a number of alternatives

rather than only one or two. For example, which school to join
or which hotel to visit or still harder which girl to marry (you
almost always end up making a wrong decision is a different
matter altogether!). Serious C programming is same; the choice we
are asked to make is more complicated than merely selecting
between two alternatives. C provides a special control statement
that allows us to handle such cases effectively; rather than using a
series of if statements. This control instruction is in fact the topic
of this chapter. Towards the end of the chapter we would also
study a keyword called goto, and understand why we should avoid
its usage in C programming.

I n real life we are often faced with situations where we are

Decisions Using switch

The control statement that allows us to make a decision from the
number of choices is called a switch, or more correctly a switch-
case-default, since these three keywords go together to make up
the control statement. They most often appear as follows:

switch (integer expression )

case constant 1 :
do this ;
case constant 2 :
do this ;
case constant 3 :
do this ;
default :
do this ;
}

The integer expression following the keyword switch is any C
expression that will yield an integer value. It could be an integer
constant like 1, 2 or 3, or an expression that evaluates to an
