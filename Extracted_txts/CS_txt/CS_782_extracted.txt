Chapter 4: The Case Control Structure 137

 

integer. The keyword case is followed by an integer or a character
constant. Each constant in each case must be different from all the
others. The “do this” lines in the above form of switch represent
any valid C statement.

What happens when we run a program containing a switch? First,
the integer expression following the keyword switch is evaluated.
The value it gives is then matched, one by one, against the
constant values that follow the case statements. When a match is
found, the program executes the statements following that case,
and all subsequent case and default statements as well. If no
match is found with any of the case statements, only the
statements following the default are executed. A few examples
will show how this control structure works.

Consider the following program:

main()
{
int i=2;
switch (i)
{
case 1:
printf ( "I amin case 1 \n") ;
case 2:
printf ( "lamin case 2 \n") ;
case 3:
printf ( "I amin case 3 \n") ;
default :
printf ("Il am in default \n" ) ;
}
}

The output of this program would be:

lam in case 2
