138 Let Us C

 

| am in case 3
| am in default

The output is definitely not what we expected! We didnâ€™t expect
the second and third line in the above output. The program prints
case 2 and 3 and the default case. Well, yes. We said the switch
executes the case where a match is found and all the subsequent
cases and the default as well.

If you want that only case 2 should get executed, it is upto you to
get out of the switch then and there by using a break statement.
The following example shows how this is done. Note that there is
no need for a break statement after the default, since the control
comes out of the switch anyway.

main()
{
int i=2;
switch (i)
{
case 1:
printf ("I am in case 1\n") ;
break ;
case 2:
printf ("I am in case 2 \n") ;
break ;
case 3:
printf ("I am in case 3\n") ;
break ;
default :
printf ("I am in default \n" ) ;
}
}

The output of this program would be:
| am in case 2
