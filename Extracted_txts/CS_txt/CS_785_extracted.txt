The Tips and Traps

A few useful tips about the usage of switch and a few pitfalls to be
avoided:

(a) The earlier program that used switch may give you the wrong
impression that you can use only cases arranged in ascending
order, 1, 2, 3 and default. You can in fact put the cases in any
order you please. Here is an example of scrambled case order:

main()
{
int i= 22;

switch (i)
{
case 121:
printf ( "lamin case 121 \n") ;
break ;
case 7:
printf ("lamin case 7 \n") ;
break ;
case 22:
printf (â€œlamin case 22 \n") ;
break ;
default :
printf ( "lam in default \n") ;
}
}

The output of this program would be:
| am in case 22

(b) You are also allowed to use char values in case and switch as
shown in the following program:

main()
