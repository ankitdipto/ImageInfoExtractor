Chapter 4: The Case Control Structure 141

 

{
char c='x';

switch ( c )
{
case'V':
printf ("I am in case v\n") ;
break ;
case'a':
printf ("I am in case a \n") ;
break ;
case'x':
printf ("I am in case x \n") ;
break ;
default :
printf ("I am in default \n" ) ;
}
}

The output of this program would be:

lam in case x

In fact here when we use ‘v’, ‘a’, ‘x’ they are actually
replaced by the ASCII values (118, 97, 120) of these character
constants.

(c) At times we may want to execute a common set of statements
for multiple cases. How this can be done is shown in the
following example.

main()
char ch;

printf (“Enter any of the alphabet a, b, orc") ;
scanf ("%c", &ch) ;
