switch (ch)
{

case ‘a’:
case 'A':
printf ("a as in ashar" ) ;
break ;

case 'b':

case 'B':

printf ("b as in brain” ) ;
break ;

case ''C:

case 'C':

printf ("c as in cookie" ) ;

break ;

default :

printf ( “wish you knew what are alphabets” ) ;
}

}

Here, we are making use of the fact that once a case is
satisfied the control simply falls through the case till it
doesn’t encounter a break statement. That is why if an
alphabet a is entered the case ‘a’ is satisfied and since there
are no statements to be executed in this case the control
automatically reaches the next case i.e. case ‘A’ and executes
all the statements in this case.

 

Even if there are multiple statements to be executed in each
case there is no need to enclose them within a pair of braces
(unlike if, and else).

Every statement in a switch must belong to some case or the
other. If a statement doesn’t belong to any case the compiler
won’t report an error. However, the statement would never get
executed. For example, in the following program the printf( )
never goes to work.
