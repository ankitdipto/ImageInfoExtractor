main()

int i,j;

printf (“Enter value of i") ;
scanf ("%d", &i) ;

switch (i)

printf (“Hello”) ;

If we have no default case, then the program simply falls
through the entire switch and continues with the next
instruction (if any,) that follows the closing brace of switch.

Is switch a replacement for if? Yes and no. Yes, because it
offers a better way of writing programs as compared to if, and
no because in certain situations we are left with no choice but
to use if. The disadvantage of switch is that one cannot have a
case in a switch which looks like:

case i <= 20:

All that we can have after the case is an int constant or a char
constant or an expression that evaluates to one of these
constants. Even a float is not allowed.

The advantage of switch over if is that it leads to a more
structured program and the level of indentation is manageable,
