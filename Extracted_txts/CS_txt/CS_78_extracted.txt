Problems for Chapter 25 705

25.3-2
What is the purpose of adding the new vertex s to V, yielding V’?

25.3-3
Suppose that w(u,v) > 0 for all edges (u,v) € E. What is the relationship
between the weight functions w and #?

25.3-4

Professor Greenstreet claims that there is a simpler way to reweight edges than
the method used in Johnson’s algorithm. Letting w* = ming,y)eg {w(u, v)}, just
define (u,v) = w(u, v) — w* for all edges (u,v) € E. What is wrong with the
professor’s method of reweighting?

25.3-5

Suppose that we run Johnson’s algorithm on a directed graph G with weight func-
tion w. Show that if G contains a 0-weight cycle c, then (u,v) = 0 for every
edge (u,v) inc.

25.3-6

Professor Michener claims that there is no need to create a new source vertex in
line 1 of JOHNSON. He claims that instead we can just use G’ = G and let s be any
vertex. Give an example of a weighted, directed graph G for which incorporating
the professor’s idea into JOHNSON causes incorrect answers. Then show that if G
is strongly connected (every vertex is reachable from every other vertex), the results
returned by JOHNSON with the professor’s modification are correct.

 

Problems

25-1 Transitive closure of a dynamic graph

Suppose that we wish to maintain the transitive closure of a directed graph G =
(V, E) as we insert edges into E. That is, after each edge has been inserted, we
want to update the transitive closure of the edges inserted so far. Assume that the
graph G has no edges initially and that we represent the transitive closure as a
boolean matrix.

a. Show how to update the transitive closure G* = (V, E*) of a graph G = (V, E)
in O(V?) time when a new edge is added to G.

b. Give an example of a graph G and an edge e such that Q(V) time is required
to update the transitive closure after the insertion of e into G, no matter what
algorithm is used.
