more so if there are multiple statements within each case of a
switch.

(bh) We can check the value of any expression in a switch. Thus
the following switch statements are legal.

switch (i+j*k)
switch (23 + 45 %4*k)
switch (a<4&&b>7)

Expressions can also be used in cases provided they are
constant expressions. Thus case 3 + 7 is correct, however,
case a + b is incorrect.

(i) The break statement when used in a switch takes the control
outside the switch. However, use of continue will not take
the control to the beginning of switch as one is likely to
believe.

Gj) In principle, a switch may occur within another, but in
practice it is rarely done. Such statements would be called
nested switch statements.

(k) The switch statement is very useful while writing menu
driven programs. This aspect of switch is discussed in the
exercise at the end of this chapter.

switch Versus if-else Ladder

There are some things that you simply cannot do with a switch.
These are:

(a) A float expression cannot be tested using a switch

(b) Cases can never have variable expressions (for example it is
wrong to say case a +3: )

(c) Multiple cases cannot use same expressions. Thus the
following switch is illegal:
