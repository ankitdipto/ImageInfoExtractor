A few remarks about the program would make the things clearer.

— Ifthe condition is satisfied the goto statement transfers control
to the label ‘sos’, causing printf() following sos to be
executed.

— The label can be on a separate line or on the same line as the
statement following it, as in,

sos : printf ("To err is human!" ) ;
— Any number of gotos can take the control to the same label.

— The exit() function is a standard library function which
terminates the execution of the program. It is necessary to use
this function since we don't want the statement

printf ("To err is human!" )

to get executed after execution of the else block.

— The only programming situation in favour of using goto is
when we want to take the control out of the loop that is
contained in several other loops. The following program
illustrates this.
