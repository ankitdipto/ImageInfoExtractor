148 Let Us C

 

main()
{
int i,j,k;

for (i= 1; 1 <= 3; i++)
{
for (j=1;j<=3;j++)
{
for (k=1;k <=3;k++)
{
if (i == 3 &&j==3 &&k ==3)
goto out ;
else
printf ("%d %d %d\n", i, j, k) ;

}
}
out :
printf ( "Out of the loop at last!" ) ;
}

Go through the program carefully and find out how it works. Also
write down the same program without using goto.

Summary

(a) When we need to choose one among number of alternatives, a
switch statement is used.

(b) The switch keyword is followed by an integer or an
expression that evaluates to an integer.

(c) The case keyword is followed by an integer or a character
constant.

(d) The control falls through all the cases unless the break
statement is given.

(e) The usage of the goto keyword should be avoided as it usually
violets the normal flow of execution.
