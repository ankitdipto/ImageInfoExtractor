of code has no label, the assembler checks the symbol in the instruction field.
If it contains an ORG pseudoinstruction, the assembler sets LC to the number
thatfollows ORG and goes back to process the next line. If the line hasan END
pseudoinstruction, the assembler terminates the first pass and goes to the
second pass. (Note that a line with ORG or END should not havea label) If
the line of code containsa label, itis stored in the address symbol table together
with its binary equivalent number specified by the content of LC. Nothing is
stored in the table if no label is encountered. LC is then incremented by 1 and
anew line of code is processed.

For theprogramof Table 68, the assembler generates the address symbol
table listed in Table 6-12. Each label symbol is stored in two memory locations
and is terminated by a comma. If the label contains less than three characters,
the memory locations are filled with the code for space. The value found in LC
while the line was processed is stored in the next sequential memory location.
â€˜The program has three symbolic addresses: MIN, SUB, and DIF. These sym-
bols represent 12-bit addresses equivalent to hexadecimal 106, 107, and 108,
