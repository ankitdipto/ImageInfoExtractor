160 Let Us C

 

italy()
{
printf (“\nl am in italy" ) ;

}
brazil()

printf (“\nl am in brazil") ;

}
argentina()

printf ( "\nl am in argentina” ) ;
}

The output of the above program when executed would be as
under:

| am in main

| am in italy

| am in brazil

| am in argentina

From this program a number of conclusions can be drawn:
— Any C program contains at least one function.

— Ifa program contains only one function, it must be main().

— IfaC program contains more than one function, then one (and
only one) of these functions must be main( ), because program
execution always begins with main().

— There is no limit on the number of functions that might be
present in a C program.

— Each function in a program is called in the sequence specified
by the function calls in main( ).
