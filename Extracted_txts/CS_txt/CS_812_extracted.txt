| am in main

| am in italy

| am in brazil

| am in argentina

| am back in italy

| am finally back in main

Here, main() calls other functions, which in turn call still other
functions. Trace carefully the way control passes from one
function to another. Since the compiler always begins the program
execution with main(), every function in a program must be
called directly or indirectly by main( ). In other words, the main( )
function drives other functions.

Let us now summarize what we have learnt so far.
(a) C program is a collection of one or more functions.

(b) A function gets called when the function name is followed by
a semicolon. For example,

main()
{

argentina( ) ;
}

(c) A function is defined when function name is followed by a
pair of braces in which one or more statements may be
present. For example,

argentina()

{
statement 1 ;
statement 2 ;
statement 3 ;
