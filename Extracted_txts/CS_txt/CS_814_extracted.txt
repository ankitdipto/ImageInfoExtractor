Chapter 5: Functions & Pointers 163

()

@

Any function can be called from any other function. Even
main( ) can be called from other functions. For example,

main()
{
message( ) ;
}
message( )

printf ( "\nCan't imagine life without C" ) ;
main() ;

}

A function can be called any number of times. For example,

main()
{
message( ) ;
message( ) ;
}
message( )

printf ( â€œ\nJewel Thief!!" ) ;
}

The order in which the functions are defined in a program and
the order in which they get called need not necessarily be
same. For example,

main()
{
message1() ;
message2() ;
}
message2()

printf ("\nBut the butter was bitter" ) ;
