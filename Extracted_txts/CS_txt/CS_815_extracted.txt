}
message1()
{
printf ( "\nMary bought some butter” ) ;

Here, even though messagel() is getting called before
message2(), still, messagel() has been defined after
message2(). However, it is advisable to define the functions
in the same order in which they are called. This makes the
program easier to understand.

A function can call itself. Such a process is called ‘recursion’.
We would discuss this aspect of C functions later in this
chapter.

A function can be called from other function, but a function
cannot be defined in another function. Thus, the following
program code would be wrong, since argentina() is being
defined inside another function, main().

main()

{
printf (“\nl am in main” ) ;
argentina()
{

printf ( "\nl am in argentina” ) ;
}
}

There are basically two types of functions:

Library functions Ex. printf(), scanf() etc.
User-defined functions Ex. argentina( ), brazil() etc.

As the name suggests, library functions are nothing but
commonly required functions grouped together and stored in
