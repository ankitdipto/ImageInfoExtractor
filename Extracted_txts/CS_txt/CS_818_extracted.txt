printf ( "\nSum = %d", sum) ;
}

calsum (x, y, Z)
int x,y, Z;
{

int d;

d=X+y+Z;
return (d);
}

And here is the output...

Enter any three numbers 10 20 30
Sum = 60

There are a number of things to note about this program:

(a) In this program, from the function main( ) the values of a, b
and ¢ are passed on to the function calsum(), by making a
call to the function calsum() and mentioning a, b and c in the
parentheses:

sum = calsum (a,b, C);

In the calsum() function these values get collected in three
variables x, y and z:

calsum (x, y, Z)
int x,y, Z;

(b) The variables a, b and c¢ are called ‘actual arguments’,
whereas the variables x, y and z are called ‘formal
arguments’. Any number of arguments can be passed to a
function being called. However, the type, order and number of
the actual and formal arguments must always be same.
