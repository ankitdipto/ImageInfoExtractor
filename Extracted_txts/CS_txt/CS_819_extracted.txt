Instead of using different variable names x, y and z, we could
have used the same variable names a, b and c. But the
compiler would still treat them as different variables since
they are in different functions.

There are two methods of declaring the formal arguments.
The one that we have used in our program is known as
Kernighan and Ritchie (or just K & R) method.

calsum (x, y, Z)
int x, y, Z;

Another method is,

calsum (int x, int y, int z)

This method is called ANSI method and is more commonly
used these days.

In the earlier programs the moment closing brace ( } ) of the
called function was encountered the control returned to the
calling function. No separate return statement was necessary
to send back the control.

This approach is fine if the called function is not going to
return any meaningful value to the calling function. In the
above program, however, we want to return the sum of x, y
and z. Therefore, it is necessary to use the return statement.

The return statement serves two purposes:

(1) On executing the return statement it immediately
transfers the control back to the calling program.

(2) It returns the value present in the parentheses after
return, to th3e calling program. In the above program
the value of sum of three numbers is being returned.
