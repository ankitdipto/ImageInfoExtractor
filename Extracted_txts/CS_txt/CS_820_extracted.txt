(g)

There is no restriction on the number of return statements
that may be present in a function. Also, the return statement
need not always be present at the end of the called function.
The following program illustrates these facts.

fun()

{
char ch;

printf ( "\nEnter any alphabet " ) ;
scanf ("%c", &ch) ;

if (ch >= 65 && ch <= 90)
return (ch) ;

else
return (ch+ 32);

In this function different return statements will be executed
depending on whether ch is capital or not.

Whenever the control returns from a function some value is
definitely returned. If a meaningful value is returned then it
should be accepted in the calling program by equating the
called function to some variable. For example,

sum = calsum (a,b, C);

All the following are valid return statements.
return (a);
return (23);
return (12.34) ;
return ;
