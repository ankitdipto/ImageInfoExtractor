170 Let Us C

G)

In the last statement a garbage value is returned to the calling
function since we are not returning any specific value. Note
that in this case the parentheses after return are dropped.

If we want that a called function should not return any value,
in that case, we must mention so by using the keyword void

as shown below.

void display()
{

 

printf ("\nHeads | win..." ) ;
printf ( â€œ\nTails you lose" ) ;
}

A function can return only one value at a time. Thus, the
following statements are invalid.

return (a,b);
return (x, 12) ;

There is a way to get around this limitation, which would be
discussed later in this chapter when we learn pointers.

If the value of a formal argument is changed in the called
function, the corresponding change does not take place in the
calling function. For example,

main()
{

int a= 30;

fun (a);

printf ( "\n%d", a) ;
}

fun (int b)
{
b=60;
