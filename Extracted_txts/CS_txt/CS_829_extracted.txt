Function Declaration and Prototypes

Any C function by default returns an int value. More specifically,
whenever a call is made to a function, the compiler assumes that
this function would return a value of the type int. If we desire that a
function should return a value other than an int, then it is necessary
to explicitly mention so in the calling function as well as in the
called function. Suppose we want to find out square of a number
using a function. This is how this simple program would look like:

main()
{
float a,b;

printf ( "\nEnter any number " ) ;
scanf ("%f", &a) ;

b = square (a) ;
printf ( "\nSquare of %f is %f", a, b ) ;

}

square (float x )

float y ;
y=X"X;

\ return (y);

And here are three sample runs of this program...

Enter any number 3
Square of 3 is 9.000000
Enter any number 1.5
Square of 1.5 is 2.000000
Enter any number 2.5
Square of 2.5 is 6.000000
