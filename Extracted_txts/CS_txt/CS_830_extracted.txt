176 Let Us C

 

The first of these answers is correct. But square of 1.5 is definitely
not 2. Neither is 6 a square of 2.5. This happened because any C
function, by default, always returns an integer value. Therefore,
even though the function square() calculates the square of 1.5 as
2.25, the problem crops up when this 2.25 is to be returned to
main(). square() is not capable of returning a float value. How
do we overcome this? The following program segment illustrates
how to make square() capable of returning a float value.

main()

{
float square (float) ;
float a,b;

printf ( "\nEnter any number ") ;
scanf ("%f", &a) ;

b = square (a);
printf ( "\nSquare of %f is %f", a, b) ;

}
float square (float x )
{
float y ;
yaX"X;
return (y) ;
}

And here is the output...

Enter any number 1.5
Square of 1.5 is 2.250000
Enter any number 2.5
Square of 2.5 is 6.250000
