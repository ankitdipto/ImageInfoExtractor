Chapter 5: Functions & Pointers 177

 

Now the expected answers i.e. 2.25 and 6.25 are obtained. Note
that the function square( ) must be declared in main() as

float square (float) ;

This statement is often called the prototype declaration of the
square() function. What it means is square( ) is a function that
receives a float and returns a float. We have done the prototype
declaration in main( ) because we have called it from main( ).
There is a possibility that we may call square() from several other
functions other than main( ). Does this mean that we would need
prototype declaration of square( ) in all these functions. No, in
such a case we would make only one declaration outside all the
functions at the beginning of the program.

In practice you may seldom be required to return a value other
than an int, but just in case you are required to, employ the above
method. In some programming situations we want that a called
function should not return any value. This is made possible by
using the keyword void. This is illustrated in the following
program.

main()

{
void gospel() ;
gospel() ;

void gospel( )
{

printf ( "\nViruses are electronic bandit
printf ( "\nwho eat nuggets of information.
(
(

 

 

printf ( "\nand chunks of bytes..." ) ;
printf ("\nwhen you least expect...
