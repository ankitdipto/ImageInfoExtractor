Chapter 5: Functions & Pointers 179

 

The difficulty beginners have with pointers has much to do with
C’s pointer terminology than the actual concept. For instance,
when a C programmer says that a certain variable is a “pointer”,
what does that mean? It is hard to see how a variable can point to
something, or in a certain direction.

It is hard to get a grip on pointers just by listening to programmer’s
jargon. In our discussion of C pointers, therefore, we will try to
avoid this difficulty by explainmg pointers in terms of

programming concepts we already understand. The first thing we
want to do is explain the rationale of C’s pointer notation.

Pointer Notation

Consider the declaration,

int i=3;

This declaration tells the C compiler to:

(a) Reserve space in memory to hold the integer value.
(b) Associate the name i with this memory location.

(c) Store the value 3 at this location.

We may represent i’s location in memory by the following
memory map.

 

i ————~ location name

value at location

65524 ————> location number
