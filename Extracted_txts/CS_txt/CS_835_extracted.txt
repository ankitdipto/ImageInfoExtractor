180 Chapter 6. Agents that Reason Logically

 

hinted at in 1943 by the psychologist Kenneth Craik, who writes, "My hypothesis then is that
thought models, or parallels, reality—that its essential feature is not ‘the mind,’ “the self, ‘sense-
data,’ nor propositions but symbolism, and that this symbolism is largely of the same kind as that
which is familiar to us in mechanical devices which aid thought and calculation. ..” (Craik, 1943).
Further work along these lines has been done by Rosenschein and Kaelbling (Rosenschein, 1985; }
Kaelbling and Rosenschein, 1990). Rosenschein and Genesereth (1987) have researched the
problem of cooperative action among agents using propositional logic internally to represent
the world. Gabbay (1991) has explored extensions to standard logic to enhance guidance of
reasoning and retrieval from large knowledge bases.

 

EXERCISES
6.1 We said that truth tables can be used to establish the validity ofa complex sentence. Show
how they can be used to decide ifa given sentence is valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable.

62 Use truth tables to show that the following sentences are valid, and thus that the equivalences
hold. Some of these equivalence rules have standard names, which are given in the right column.

63 Look at the following sentences and decide for each if it is valid, unsatisfiable, or neither.
Verify your decisions using truth tables, or by using the equivalence rules of Exercise 6.2. Were
there any that initially confused you?
