Figure 1-9 Map for F(A,B, C) = 3 (0,2.4.5.6).

The third example needs a four-variable map.
F(A,B,C,D) = & (0,1,2,6,8,9, 10)

The area in the map covered by this four-variable function consists of the
squares marked with 1’s in Fig, 1-10. The function contains 1’s in the four
corners that, when taken as a group, give the term B’D’. This is possible
because these four squares are adjacent when the map is considered with top
and bottom or left and right edges touching. The two 1’s on the left of the top
row are combined with the two 1’s on the left of the bottom row to give the
term B’C’. The remaining 1 in the square of minterm 6 is combined with
minterm 2 to give the term A’CD’. The simplified function is

F =B’D’+B'C’ + A'CD’

Product-of-Sums Simplification

The Boolean expressions derived from the maps in the preceding examples
were expressed in sum-of-products form. The product terms are AND terms
and the sum denotes the ORing of these terms. It is sometimes convenient to
obtain the algebraic expression for the function in a product-of-sums form The
