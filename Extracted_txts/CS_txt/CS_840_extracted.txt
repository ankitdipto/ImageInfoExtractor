The concept of pointers can be further extended. Pointer, we know
is a variable that contains address of another variable. Now this
variable itself might be another poimter. Thus, we now have a
pointer that contains another pointer’s address. The following
example should make this point clear.

main()

{
int i =3, 9, “k;
j=8i;
k = &;

printf ( "\nAddress of i= %u", &i )

printf ("\nAddress of i= %u", j ) ;

printf ("\nAddress of i = %u", *k ) ;
printf ("\nAddress of j = %u", &j) ;
printf ("\nAddress of j = %u", k) ;

printf ("\nAddress of ;
printf ( "\nValue of j =
printf ( "“\nValue of k
printf ("nValue of i =
printf ("\nValue of i =
printf ( "nValue of
printf ( "“\nValue of i

  
   
 
 
 

}

The output of the above program would be:

Address of i = 65524

Address of i = 65524
Address of i = 65524
Address of j = 65522
Address of j = 65522
Address of k = 65520
Value of | = 65524

Value of k = 65522
