the change effective in main(). That is why when the control
returns from the function areaperi() we are able to output the
values of area and perimeter.

Thus, we have been able to indirectly return two values from a
called function, and hence, have overcome the limitation of the
return statement, which can return only one value from a function
at a time.

Conclusions

From the programs that we discussed here we can draw the
following conclusions:

(a) Ifwe want that the value of an actual argument should not get
changed in the function being called, pass the actual argument
by value.

(b) If we want that the value of an actual argument should get
changed in the function being called, pass the actual argument
by reference.

(c) Ifa function is to be made to return more than one value at a
time then return these values indirectly by using a call by
reference.

Recursion

In C, it is possible for the functions to call themselves. A function
is called ‘recursive’ if a statement within the body of a function
calls the same function. Sometimes called ‘circular definition’,
recursion is thus the process of defining something in terms of
itself.

Let us now see a simple example of recursion. Suppose we want to
calculate the factorial value of an integer. As we know, the
