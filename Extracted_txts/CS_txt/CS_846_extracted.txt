Summary 181

 

e. ((SmokeA Heat) = Fire) < ((Smoke => Fire) V (Heat = Fire))
f. (Smoke = Fire) = ((SmokeA Heat) = Fire)

g. Big V Dumb V (Big = Dumb)

h. (Big Dumb) V ~Dumb

6.4 Is the sentence "Either 2 + 2 = 4 and itis raining, or 2+2 = 4 and itis not raining" making
aclaim about arithmetic, weather, or neither? Explain.

65 (Adapted from (Barwise and Etchemendy, 1993).) Given the following, can you prove that

the unicorn is mythical? How about magical? Horned?

Ne! If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not mythical, then it is a

mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is homed.
The unicorn is magical if it is horned.

6.6 What ontological and epistemological commitments are made by the language of real-
number arithmetic?

6.7 Consider a world in which there are only four propositions, 4, B, C, and D. How many
models are there for the following sentences?

a. ANB

b. AVB
C.AABAC

68 We have defined four different binary logical connectives.

a. Are there any others that might be useful?
b. How many binary connectives can there possibly be?
c. Why are some of them not very useful?

69 Some agents make inferences as soon as they are told a new sentence, while others wait until
they are asked before they do any inferencing. What difference does this make at the knowledge
level, the logical level, and the implementation level?

6.10 We said it would take 64 propositional logic sentences to express the simple rule "don't
go forward if the wumpus is in front of you." What ifwe represented this fact with the single rule
WumpusAhead => Forward

Is this feasible? What effects does it have on the rest of the knowledge base?
6.11 Provide a formal syntax, semantics, and proof theory for algebraic equations including

variables, numbers, +, â€”, x, and +. You should be able to provide inference steps for most
standard equation manipulation techniques.
