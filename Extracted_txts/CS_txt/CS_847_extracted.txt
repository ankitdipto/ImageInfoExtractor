190 Let Us C

 

factorial of a number is the product of all the integers between 1
and that number. For example, 4 factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. This can
also be expressed as 4! = 4 * 3! where â€˜!â€™ stands for factorial. Thus
factorial of a number can be expressed in the form of itself. Hence
this can be programmed using recursion. However, before we try
to write a recursive function for calculating factorial let us take a
look at the non-recursive function for calculating the factorial
value of an integer.

main()
{
int a, fact ;

printf ( "\nEnter any number ") ;
scanf ("%d", &a) ;

fact = factorial (a) ;
printf ( "Factorial value = %d", fact ) ;

}
factorial (int x )
{
int f=1i;
for (i=X;i>=1;i-)
f=f*i;
return (f) ;
}

And here is the output...

Enter any number 3
Factorial value = 6
