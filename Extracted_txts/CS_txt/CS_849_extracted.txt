Chapter 5: Functions & Pointers 191

 

Work through the above program carefully, till you understand the
logic of the program properly. Recursive factorial function can be
understood only if you are thorough with the above logic.

Following is the recursive version of the function to calculate the
factorial value.

main()
{
int a, fact ;

printf ( "\nEnter any number " ) ;
scanf ("%d", &a) ;

fact = rec (a);
printf ("Factorial value = %d", fact) ;

}
rec (int x)
{
int f;
if (x==1)
return(1);
else
f=x"rec(x-1);
return (f);
}

And here is the output for four runs of the program

Enter any number 1
Factorial value = 1
Enter any number 2
Factorial value = 2
Enter any number 3
