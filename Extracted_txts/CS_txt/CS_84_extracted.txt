5-2 Computer Registers

‘Computer instructions are normally stored in consecutive memory locations
and are executed sequentially one at a time. The control reads an instruction
from aspecific address in memory and executes it. It then continues by reading
the next instruction in sequence and executes it, and so on. This type of
instruction sequencing needs a counter to calculate the address of the next
instruction after execution of the current instruction is completed. It is also
necessary to provide a register in the control unit for storing the instruction
