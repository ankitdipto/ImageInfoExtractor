198 Let Us C

 

compilers provide a utility called ‘tlib.exe’ (Turbo Librarian). Let
us use this utility to add a function factorial() to the library.

Given below are the steps to do so:

Write the function definition of factorial( ) in some file, say
‘fact.c’.

int factorial (int num )

 

{
int i, f=1;
for (i=1;i<= num; i++)
f=f*i;
return (f);
}

Compile the ‘fact.c’ file using Alt F9. A new file called
‘fact.obj’ would get created containing the compiled code in
machine language.

Add the function to the library by issuing the command

C:\stlib- math.lib + c:\fact.obj

Here, ‘math.lib’ is a library filename, + is a switch, which
means we want to add new function to library and ‘c:\fact.obj’
is the path of the ‘.obj’ file.

Declare the prototype of the factorial( ) function in the header
file, say ‘fact.h’. This file should be included while calling the
function.

To use the function present inside the library, create a
program as shown below:

#include "c:\Mfact.h"
main()
