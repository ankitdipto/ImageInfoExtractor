{
intf;
f = factorial (5);
printf ("%6d", f) ;

(f) Compile and execute the program using Ctrl F9.

If we wish we can delete the existing functions present in the
library using the minus (- ) switch.

Instead of modifying the existing libraries we can create our own
library. Let’s see how to do this. Let us assume that we wish to
create a library containing the functions factorial( ), prime() and
fibonacci( ). As their names suggest, factorial( ) calculates and
returns the factorial value of the integer passed to it, prime( )
reports whether the number passed to it is a prime number or not
and fibonacci( ) prints the first n terms of the Fibonacci series,
where n is the number passed to it. Here are the steps that need to
be carried out to create this library. Note that these steps are
specific to Turbo C/C++ compiler and would vary for other
compilers.

(a) Define the functions factorial( ), prime() and fibonacci( ) in
a file, say ‘myfuncs.c’. Do not define main( ) in this file.

(b) Create a file ‘myfuncs.h’ and declare the prototypes of
factorial( ), prime( ) and fibonacci() in it as shown below:

int factorial ( int ) ;
int prime (int) ;
void fibonacci ( int ) ;
(c) From the Options menu select the menu-item ‘Application’.

From the dialog that pops us select the option ‘Library’.
Select OK.
