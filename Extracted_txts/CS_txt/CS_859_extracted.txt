200 Let Us C

 

@

Compile the program using Alt F9. This would create the
library file called ‘myfuncs.lib’.

That’s it. The library now stands created. Now we have to use the
functions defined in this library. Here is how it can be done.

Create a file, say ‘sample.c’ and type the following code in it.

#include "myfuncs.h"
main()
{
int f, result ;
f = factorial (5) ;
result = prime (13) ;
fibonacci (6 ) ;
printf ("\n%d %d", f, result ) ;

Note that the file ‘myfuncs.h’ should be in the same directory
as the file ‘sample.c’. If not, then while including ‘myfuncs.h’
mention the appropriate path.

Go to the ‘Project’ menu and select ‘Open Project...’ option.
On doing so a dialog would pop up. Give the name of the
project, say ‘sample.prj’ and select OK.

From the ‘Project’ menu select ‘Add Item’. On doing so a file
dialog would appear. Select the file ‘sample.c’ and then select
‘Add’. Also add the file ‘myfuncs.lib’ in the same manner.
Finally select ‘Done’.

Compile and execute the project using Ctrl F9.
