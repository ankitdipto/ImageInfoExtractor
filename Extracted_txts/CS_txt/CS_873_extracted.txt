Attempt the following:

A 5-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard,
write a function to calculate sum of digits of the 5-digit
number:

(1) Without using recursion
(2) Using recursion

A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a
program to obtain the prime factors of the number. Modify the
function suitably to obtain the prime factors recursively.

Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a
Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two
successive terms gives the third term. Following are the first
few terms of the Fibonacci sequence:

1 123 5 8 13 21 34 55 89...

A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a
function to find the binary equivalent of this number using
recursion.

Write a recursive function to obtain the running sum of first
25 natural numbers.

Write a C function to evaluate the series

sin(x) = x —(x°/3!) +(x° /SI)— (x7 / TN) te
