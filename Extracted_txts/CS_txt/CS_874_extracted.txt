to five significant digits.

Given three variables x, y, z write a function to circularly shift
their values to right. In other words if x = 5, y = 8, z = 10 after
circular shift y = 5, z = 8, x =10 after circular shift y= 5, z= 8
and x = 10. Call the function with variables a, b, ¢ to
circularly shift values.

Write a function to find the binary equivalent of a given
decimal integer and display it.

If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are denoted by a, b,
and c, then area of triangle is given by

area = .{S(S —a)(S —b)(S —c)
where, S=(a+b+c)/2

Write a function to compute the distance between two points
and use it to develop another function that will compute the
area of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2),
and C(x3, y3). Use these functions to develop a function
which returns a value 1 if the point (x, y) lines inside the
triangle ABC, otherwise a value 0.

Write a function to compute the greatest common divisor
given by Euclid’s algorithm, exemplified for J = 1980, K =
1617 as follows:

-1* =
1980/1617=1 1980 —1 * 1617 = 363

1617 / 363 =4 1617 —4 * 363 = 165
363/165 =2 363 —2 * 165 = 33
5/33=5 165-5 * 33=0

Thus, the greatest common divisor is 33.
