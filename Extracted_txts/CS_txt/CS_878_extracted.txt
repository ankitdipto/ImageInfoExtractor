216 Let Us C

 

long int i;
long int abc ;

long integers cause the program to run a bit slower, but the range
of values that we can use is expanded tremendously. The value of
a long integer typically can vary from -2147483648 to
+2147483647. More than this you should not need unless you are
taking a world census.

If there are such things as longs, symmetry requires shorts as
well—integers that need less space in memory and thus help speed
up program execution. short integer variables are declared as,

short int j;
short int height ;

C allows the abbreviation of short int to short and of long int to
long. So the declarations made above can be written as,

long i;

long abc ;
short j;
short height ;

Naturally, most C programmers prefer this short-cut.
Sometimes we come across situations where the constant is small
enough to be an int, but still we want to give it as much storage as

a long. In such cases we add the suffix ‘L’ or ‘I’ at the end of the
number, as in 23L.

Integers, signed and unsigned

Sometimes, we know in advance that the value stored in a given
integer variable will always be positive—when it is being used to
