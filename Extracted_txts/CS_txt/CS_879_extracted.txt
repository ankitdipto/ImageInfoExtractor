Chapter 6, Agents that Reason Logically

 

See Selman et al. (1992) for more on GSAT. They present an implementation of GSAT that solves
even the hardest 3SAT problems with N = 70 in under a second. GSAT can be used to solve a
wide variety of problems by constructing a reduction from each class of problems to 3SAT. It
is so efficient that it often outperforms special-purpose algorithms that are expertly designed for
specific problems

6.16 Consider the problem of designing a logical agent for the wumpus world using a Boolean
circuitâ€”that is, a collection of logic gates connecting the inputs (percept values) to outputs
(action values).

a. Explain why you would need flip-flops.

b. Give an order-of-magnitude estimate of how many gates and flip-flops would you need.
