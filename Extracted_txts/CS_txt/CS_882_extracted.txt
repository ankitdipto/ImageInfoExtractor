Chapter 6: Data Types Revisited 219

 

overcome this difficulty? Would declaring ch as an unsigned char
solve the problem? Even this would not serve the purpose since
when ch reaches a value 255, cht++ would try to make it 256
which cannot be stored in an unsigned char. Thus the only
altemative is to declare ch as an int. However, if we are bent upon
writing the program using unsigned char, it can be done as shown
below. The program is definitely less elegant, but workable all the
same.

main()
{
unsigned char ch ;

for (ch=0; ch <= 254; ch++)
printf ( “\n%d %c", ch, ch ) ;

printf (“\n%d %c", ch, ch) ;
}

Floats and Doubles

A float occupies four bytes in memory and can range from -3.4e38
to +3.4e38. If this is insufficient then C offers a double data type
that occupies 8 bytes in memory and has a range from -1.7e308 to
+1.7e308. A variable of type double can be declared as,

double a, population ;

If the situation demands usage of real numbers that lie even
beyond the range offered by double data type, then there exists a
long double that can range from -1.7e4932 to +1.7e4932. A long
double occupies 10 bytes in memory.

You would see that most of the times in C programming one is
required to use either chars or ints and cases where floats,
doubles or long doubles would be used are indeed rare.
