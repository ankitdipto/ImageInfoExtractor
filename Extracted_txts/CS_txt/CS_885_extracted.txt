The essence of all the data types that we have learnt

Data Type Range Bytes | Format
signed char -128 to+ 127 1 %e
unsigned char 0 to 255 1 Yc
short signed int -32768 to +32767 2 %d
short unsigned int | 0 to 65535 2 Yu

long unsigned int | 0 to 4294967295 4 %lu
float -3.4e38 to +3.4e38 4 %E
double -1.7e308 to +1.7€308 8 “lt
long double -1.7e4932 to +1.7e4932 10 %LE

 

 

 

 

Note: The sizes and ranges of int, short and long are compiler
dependent. Sizes in this figure are for 16-bit compiler.

A Few More Issues...

Having seen all the variations of the primary types let us take a
look at some more related issues.

(a) We saw earlier that size of an integer is compiler dependent.
This is even true in case of chars and floats. Also, depending
upon the microprocessor for which the compiler targets its
code the accuracy of floating point calculations may change.
For example, the result of 22.0/7.0 would be reported more
