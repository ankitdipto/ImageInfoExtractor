also true. If we exceed the range from negative side we end up
on positive side.

Storage Classes in C

We have already said all that needs to be said about constants, but
we are not finished with variables. To fully define a variable one
needs to mention not only its ‘type’ but also its ‘storage class’. In
other words, not only do all variables have a data type, they also
have a ‘storage class’.

We have not mentioned storage classes yet, though we have
written several programs in C. We were able to get away with this
because storage classes have defaults. If we don’t specify the
storage class of a variable in its declaration, the compiler will
assume a storage class depending on the context in which the
variable is used. Thus, variables have certain default storage
classes.

From C compiler’s point of view, a variable name identifies some
physical location within the computer where the string of bits
representing the variable’s value is stored. There are basically two
kinds of locations in a computer where such a value may be kept—
Memory and CPU registers. It is the variable’s storage class that
determines in which of these two locations the value is stored.

Moreover, a variable’s storage class tells us:

(a) Where the variable would be stored.

(b) What will be the initial value of the variable, if initial value is
not specifically assigned.(i.e. the default initial value).

(c) What is the scope of the variable; i.e. in which functions the
value of the variable would be available.

(d) What is the life of the variable; i.e. how long would the
variable exist.
