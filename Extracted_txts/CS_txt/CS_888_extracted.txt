224 Let Us C

 

There are four storage classes in C:

(a) Automatic storage class
(b) Register storage class
(c) Static storage class

(d) External storage class

Let us examine these storage classes one by one.

Automatic Storage Class

The features of a variable defined to have an automatic storage
class are as under:

Storage — Memory.

Default initial value - An unpredictable value, which is often
called a garbage value.

Scope — Local to the block in which the variable
is defined.

Life — Till the control remains within the block

in which the variable is defined.

Following program shows how an automatic storage class variable
is declared, and the fact that if the variable is not initialized it
contains a garbage value.

main()
{
auto int i, j ;
printf ("\n%d_%d", i,j);
The output of the above program could be...
1211 221

where, 1211 and 221 are garbage values of i and j. When you run
this program you may get different values, since garbage values
