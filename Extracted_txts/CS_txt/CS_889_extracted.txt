are unpredictable. So always make it a point that you initialize the
automatic variables properly, otherwise you are likely to get
unexpected results. Note that the keyword for this storage class is
auto, and not automatic.

Scope and life of an automatic variable is illustrated in the
following program.

main()
{
auto int i= 1;
{
{
{
printf ( "\n%d ", i);
}
printf ("%d", i) ;
}
printf ( "%d", i);
}
}

The output of the above program is:
111

This is because, all printf() statements occur within the outermost
block (a block is all statements enclosed within a pair of braces) in
which i has been defined. It means the scope of i is local to the
block in which it is defined. The moment the control comes out of
the block in which the variable is defined, the variable and its
value is irretrievably lost. To catch my point, go through the
following program.

main()

{
auto int i= 1;
{
