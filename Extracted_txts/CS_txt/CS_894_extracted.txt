228 Let Us C

 

Scope — Local to the block in which the variable
is defined.
Life — Value of the variable persists between

different function calls.

Compare the two programs and their output given in Figure 6.3 to
understand the difference between the automatic and static
storage classes.

 

 

 

 

 

main() main()
{ {
increment() ; increment() ;
increment() ; increment() ;
increment() ; increment() ;
} }
increment() increment()
{
auto inti = 1; static int i= 1;
printf ("%d\n", i) ; printf (“%d\n", i) ;
i=i+1; i=i+1;
}
The output of the above programs would be:
1 1
1 2
1 3
Figure 6.3

The programs above consist of two functions main() and
increment( ). The function increment( ) gets called from main( )
thrice. Each time it increments the value of i and prints it. The only
difference in the two programs is that one uses an auto storage
class for variable i, whereas the other uses static storage class.
