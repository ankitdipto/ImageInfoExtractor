Chapter 6: Data Types Revisited 231

 

External variables differ from those we have already discussed in
that their scope is global, not local. External variables are declared
outside all functions, yet are available to all functions that care to
use them. Here is an example to illustrate this fact.

int i;
main()
{
printf ( â€œ\ni = %d", i) ;

increment() ;
increment() ;
decrement ) ;
decrement ) ;
}

increment( )
{

i=i+1;

printf ( "\non incrementing i = %d", i) ;
}

decrement( )
{

i=i-1;

printf ( "\non decrementing i = %d", i) ;
}

The output would be:

i=0

on incrementing i = 1

on incrementing i = 2

on decrementing i = 1
on decrementing i = 0
