232 Let Us C

 

As is obvious from the above output, the value of i is available to
the functions increment( ) and decrement( ) since i has been
declared outside all functions.

Look at the following program.

int X= 21;
main()

externint y ;
printf ( "In%d %d", x, y);

}
inty = 31;

Here, x and y both are global variables. Since both of them have
been defined outside all the functions both enjoy external storage
class. Note the difference between the following:

extern int y ;

int y = 31;

Here the first statement is a declaration, whereas the second is the
definition. When we declare a variable no space is reserved for it,
whereas, when we define it space gets reserved for it in memory.
We had to declare y since it is being used in printf( ) before it’s
definition is encountered. There was no need to declare x since its
definition is done before its usage. Also remember that a variable
can be declared several times but can be defined only once.

Another small issue—what will be the output of the following
program?

int x= 10;
main()
{

int x = 20;

printf ( "\n%d", x) ;
