Figure 26.3 Converting a multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-flow problem into a problem
with a single source and a single sink. (a) A flow network with five sources S = {51,52,53.54,95}
and three sinks T = {f1, 12,3}. (b) An equivalent single-source, single-sink flow network, We add
a supersource s and an edge with infinite capacity from s to each of the multiple sources. We also
add a supersink r and an edge with infinite capacity from each of the multiple sinks to r.

26.1-2

Extend the flow properties and definitions to the multiple-source, multiple-sink
problem. Show that any flow in a multiple-source, multiple-sink flow network
corresponds to a flow of identical value in the single-source, single-sink network
obtained by adding a supersource and a supersink, and vice versa.

26.1-3

Suppose that a flow network G = (V, £) violates the assumption that the network
contains a path s ~+ v ~+ ¢ for all vertices v € V. Let u be a vertex for which there
is no path s ~+ u ~+ t. Show that there must exist a maximum flow f in G such
that f(u,v) = f(v,u) = 0 for all vertices v € V.
