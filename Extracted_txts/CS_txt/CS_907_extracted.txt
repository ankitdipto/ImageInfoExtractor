Storage for a register storage class variable is allocated
each time the control reaches the block in which it is
present.

An extern storage class variable is not available to the
functions that precede its definition, unless the variable is
explicitly declared in these functions.

The value of an automatic storage class variable persists
between various function invocations.

If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage
class variables are treated as static storage class variables.

The register storage class variables cannot hold float
values.

If we try to use register storage class for a float variable
the compiler will flash an error message.
