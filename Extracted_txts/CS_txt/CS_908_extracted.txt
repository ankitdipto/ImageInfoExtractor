240 Let Us C

 

(g) If the variable x is defined as extern and a variable x is
also defined as a local variable of some function, then the
global variable gets preference over the local variable.

(hb) The default value for automatic variable is zero.

(i) The life of static variable is till the control remains within
the block in which it is defined.

Gj) If a global variable is to be defined, then the extern
keyword is necessary in its declaration.

(k) The address of register variable is not accessible.

[D] Following program calculates the sum of digits of the number
12345. Go through it and find out why is it necessary to
declare the storage class of the variable sum as static.

main()

{
int a;
a = sumdig ( 12345 ) ;
printf ( "\n%d", a) ;

sumdig (int num )
{
static int sum ;
int a,b;
a=num % 10;
b=(num-a)/10;
sum = sum +a;
if(b!=0)
sumdig (b ) ;
else
return (sum) ;
