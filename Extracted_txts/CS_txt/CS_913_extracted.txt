interpretation, might refer to the evil King John, king of England from 1199 to 1216
and younger brother of Richard the Lionheart. The symbol King could refer to the same
object/person in the same interpretation.

& Predicate symbols: Round, Brother, ...

An interpretation specifies that a predicate symbol refers to a particular relation in
the model. For example, the Brother symbol might refer to the relation of brotherhood.
Brother is a binary predicate symbol, and accordingly brotherhood is a relation that holds
(or fails to hold) between pairs of objects. In any given model, the relation is defined by
the set of tuples of objects that satisfy it. A tuple is a collection of objects arranged in
a fixed order. They are written with angle brackets surrounding the objects. In a model
containing three objects, King John, Robin Hood, and Richard the Lionheart, the relation
of brotherhood is defined by the set of tuples

{ (King John, Richard the Lionheart),
(Richard the Lionheart, King John) }

Thus, formally speaking, Brother refers to this set of tuples under the interpretation we
have chosen.
