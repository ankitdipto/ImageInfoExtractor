244 Let Us C

 

(c) Conditional Compilation
(d) Miscellaneous directives

Let us understand these features of preprocessor one by one.

Macro Expansion
Have a look at the following program.

#define UPPER 25
main()
{
int i;
for (i= 1;i <= UPPER ; i++)
printf (“\n%d", i) ;
}

In this program instead of writing 25 in the for loop we are writing
it in the form of UPPER, which has already been defined before
main( ) through the statement,

#define UPPER 25

This statement is called ‘macro definition’ or more commonly, just
a ‘macro’. What purpose does it serve? During preprocessing, the
preprocessor replaces every occurrence of UPPER in the program
with 25. Here is another example of macro definition.

#define Pl 3.1415

main()

{
float r= 6.25 ;
float area ;
area = PI*r*r;

printf ( "\nArea of circle = %f", area ) ;
