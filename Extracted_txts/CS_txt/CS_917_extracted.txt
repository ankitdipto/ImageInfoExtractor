Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 247

 

Thus, using #define can produce more efficient and more easily
understandable programs. This directive is used extensively by C
programmers, as you will see in many programs in this book.

Following three examples show places where a #define directive is
popularly used by C programmers.

A #define directive is many a times used to define operators as
shown below.

#define AND &&
#define OR ||
main()
{
int f= 1,x=4,y=90;

if ((f<5) AND (x <=200Ry<-45))
printf ( "\nYour PC will always work fine..." ) ;
else
printf ( "\nIn front of the maintenance man” ) ;
}

A #define directive could be used even to replace a condition, as
shown below.

#define AND &&
#define ARANGE (a > 25 AND a< 50)
main()
{
int a= 30;

if (ARANGE )

printf ( “within range" ) ;
else

printf (“out of range") ;
