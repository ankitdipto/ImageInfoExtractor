248 Let Us C

 

A #define directive could be used to replace even an entire C
statement. This is shown below.

#define FOUND printf ("The Yankee Doodle Virus" ) ;
main()

char signature ;

if (signature == 'Y' )
FOUND
else
printf ( “Safe... as yet !") ;
}

Macros with Arguments
The macros that we have used so far are called simple macros.
Macros can have arguments, just as functions can. Here is an

example that illustrates this fact.

#define AREA(x) (3.14 *x * x)

main()

{
float r1 = 6.25, 12 = 2.5, a;
a=AREA(r1);
printf ( "\nArea of circle = %f", a) ;
a=AREA(12);

printf ("\nArea of circle = %f", a ) ;
}

Here’s the output of the program...

Area of circle = 122.656250
Area of circle = 19.625000
