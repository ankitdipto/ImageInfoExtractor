Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 249

 

In this program wherever the preprocessor finds the phrase
AREA(x) it expands it into the statement ( 3.14 * x * x ).
However, that’s not all that it does. The x in the macro template
AREA(x) is an argument that matches the x in the macro
expansion ( 3.14 * x * x ). The statement AREA(r1) in the
program causes the variable r1 to be substituted for x. Thus the
statement AREA(r1) is equivalent to:

(3.14 *11*11)

After the above source code has passed through the preprocessor,
what the compiler gets to work on will be this:

main()
{
float r1 = 6.25, 12 = 2.5,a;

a=3.14° 11;
printf ("Area of circle = fin", a) ;
a= 3.14 "12 "12;
printf ( "Area of circle = %f", a) ;
}

Here is another example of macros with arguments:

#define ISDIGIT(y) (y >= 48 && y <= 57)
main()
{

char ch;

printf ( “Enter any digit") ;
scanf ("%c", &ch ) ;

if (ISDIGIT (ch) )
printf ( "\nYou entered a digit" ) ;
else
printf ( “\nlllegal input” ) ;
