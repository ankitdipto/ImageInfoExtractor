Here are some important points to remember while writing macros
with arguments:

(a)

()

Be careful not to leave a blank between the macro template
and its argument while defining the macro. For example, there
should be no blank between AREA and (x) in the definition,
#define AREA(x) (3.14 *x*x)

If we were to write AREA (x) instead of AREA(s), the (x)
would become a part of macro expansion, which we certainly
don’t want. What would happen is, the template would be
expanded to

(11) (3.14 *r1*11)
which won’t run. Not at all what we wanted.

The entire macro expansion should be enclosed within
parentheses. Here is an example of what would happen if we
fail to enclose the macro expansion within parentheses.

#define SQUARE(n) n*n
main()
{
int j;
j=64/ SQUARE (4);
printf ("j= %d", j) ;
}

The output of the above program would be:
j=64

whereas, what we expected was j = 4.
