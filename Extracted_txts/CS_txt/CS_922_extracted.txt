What went wrong? The macro was expanded into
j=64/4*4;
which yielded 64.

Macros can be split into multiple lines, with a ‘\’ (back slash)
present at the end of each line. Following program shows how
we can define and use multiple line macros.

#define HLINE for (i=0;i1<79;i++)\
printf ("%c", 196 ) ;

#define VLINE( X,Y) {\
gotoxy (X,Y) ;\
printf ("%c", 179) ;\

}
main()
{
inti, y;
clrscr() ;

gotoxy (1,12);
HLINE

for(y=1;y<25;y++)
VLINE (39, y);
}

This program draws a vertical and a horizontal line in the
center of the screen.

If for any reason you are unable to debug a macro then you
should view the expanded code of the program to see how the
macros are getting expanded. If your source code is present in
the file PR1.C then the expanded source code would be stored
