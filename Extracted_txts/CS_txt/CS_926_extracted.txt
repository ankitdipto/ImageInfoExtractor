254 Let Us C

 

needed functions and macro definitions can be stored in a file,
and that file can be included in every program we write,
which would add all the statements in this file to our program
as if we have typed them in.

It is common for the files that are to be included to have a h
extension. This extension stands for ‘header file’, possibly because
it contains statements which when included go to the head of your
program. The prototypes of all the library functions are grouped
into different categories and then stored in different header files.
For example prototypes of all mathematics related functions are
stored in the header file ‘math.h’, prototypes of console
input/output functions are stored in the header file ‘conio.h’, and
so on.

Actually there exist two ways to write #include statement. These
are:

#include "filename"
#include <filename>

The meaning of each of these forms is given below:

#include "goto.c" This command would look for the file goto.c
in the current directory as well as the
specified list of directories as mentioned in
the include search path that might have been
set up.

#include <goto.c> This command would look for the file goto.c
in the specified list of directories only.

The include search path is nothing but a list of directories that
would be searched for the file being included. Different C
compilers let you set the search path in different manners. If you
are using Turbo C/C++ compiler then the search path can be set up
by selecting ‘Directories’ from the ‘Options’ menu. On doing this
