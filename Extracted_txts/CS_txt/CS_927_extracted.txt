Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 255

 

a dialog box appears. In this dialog box against ‘Include
Directories’ we can specify the search path. We can also specify
multiple include paths separated by ‘;’ (semicolon) as shown
below:

c:\tc\lib ; c:\mylib ; d:\libfiles

The path can contain maximum of 127 characters. Both relative
and absolute paths are valid. For example ‘..\dir\incfiles’ is a valid
path.

Conditional Compilation

We can, if we want, have the compiler skip over part of a source
code by inserting the preprocessing commands #ifdef and #endif,
which have the general form:

#ifdef macroname
statement 1 ;
statement 2 ;
statement 3 ;

#endif

If macroname has been #defined, the block of code will be
processed as usual; otherwise not.

Where would #ifdef be useful? When would you like to compile
only a part of your program? In three cases:

(a) To “comment out” obsolete lines of code. It often happens
that a program is changed at the last minute to satisfy a client.
This involves rewriting some part of source code to the
client’s satisfaction and deleting the old code. But veteran
programmers are familiar with the clients who change their
mind and want the old code back again just the way it was.
