256 Let Us C

 

()

Now you would definitely not like to retype the deleted code
again.

One solution in such a situation is to put the old code within a
pair of /* */ combination. But we might have already
written a comment in the code that we are about to “comment
out”. This would mean we end up with nested comments.
Obviously, this solution won’t work since we can’t nest
comments in C.

Therefore the solution is to use conditional compilation as
shown below.

main()

#ifdef OKAY
statement 1;
statement 2; /* detects virus “/
statement 3 ;
statement 4 ; /* specific to stone virus */
#endif

statement 5 ;

statement 6 ;

statement 7 ;
}

Here, statements 1, 2, 3 and 4 would get compiled only if the
macro OKAY has been defined, and we have purposefully
omitted the definition of the macro OKAY. At a later date, if
we want that these statements should also get compiled all
that we are required to do is to delete the #ifdef and #endif
statements.

A more sophisticated use of #ifdef has to do with making the
programs portable, i.e. to make them work on two totally
different computers. Suppose an organization has two
