Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 257

 

different types of computers and you are expected to write a
program that works on both the machines. You can do so by
isolating the lines of code that must be different for each
machine by marking them off with #ifdef. For example:

main()
{
#ifdef INTEL
code suitable for a Intel PC
#else
code suitable for a Motorola PC
#endif
code common to both the computers
}

When you compile this program it would compile only the
code suitable for a Intel PC and the common code. This is
because the macro INTEL has not been defined. Note that the
working of #ifdef - #else - #endif is similar to the ordinary if -
else control instruction of C.

If you want to run your program on a Motorola PC, just add a
statement at the top saying,

#define INTEL

Sometimes, instead of #ifdef the #ifndef directive is used.
The #ifndef (which means ‘if not defined’) works exactly
opposite to #ifdef. The above example if written using
#ifndef, would look like this:

main()

#ifndef INTEL

code suitable for a Intel PC
#else

code suitable for a Motorola PC
