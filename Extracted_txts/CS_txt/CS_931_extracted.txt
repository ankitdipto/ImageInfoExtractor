Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 259

 

A simple example of #if directive is shown below:

main()
{

#if TEST <=5
statement 1;
statement 2 ;
statement 3 ;

#else
statement 4 ;
statement 5 ;
statement 6 ;

#endif

}

If the expression, TEST <= 5 evaluates to true then statements 1, 2
and 3 are compiled otherwise statements 4, 5 and 6 are compiled.
In place of the expression TEST <= 5 other expressions like
(LEVEL == HIGH || LEVEL == LOW) or ADAPTER ==
CGA can also be used.

If we so desire we can have nested conditional compilation
directives. An example that uses such directives is shown below.

#if ADAPTER == VGA
code for video graphics array
#else
#if ADAPTER == SVGA
code for super video graphics array
#else
code for extended graphics adapter
#endif
#endif

The above program segment can be made more compact by using
another conditional compilation directive called #elif. The same
program using this directive can be rewritten as shown below.
