260 Let Us C

 

Observe that by using the #elif directives the number of #endifs
used in the program get reduced.

#if ADAPTER == VGA

code for video graphics array
#elif ADAPTER == SVGA

code for super video graphics array
#else

code for extended graphics adapter
#endif

Miscellaneous Directives

There are two more preprocessor directives available, though they
are not very commonly used. They are:

(a) #undef

(b) #pragma

#undef Directive

On some occasions it may be desirable to cause a defined name to
become ‘undefined’. This can be accomplished by means of the
#undef directive. In order to undefine a macro that has been earlier
#defined, the directive,

#undef macro template

can be used. Thus the statement,

#undef PENTIUM

would cause the definition of PENTIUM to be removed from the
system. All subsequent #ifdef PENTIUM statements would
evaluate to false. In practice seldom are you required to undefine a

macro, but for some reason if you are required to, then you know
that there is something to fall back upon.
