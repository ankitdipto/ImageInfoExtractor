Chapter 7: The C Preprocessor 261

 

#pragma Directive

This directive is another special-purpose directive that you can use
to turn on or off certain features. Pragmas vary from one compiler
to another. There are certain pragmas available with Microsoft C
compiler that deal with formatting source listings and placing
comments in the object file generated by the compiler. Turbo
C/C++ compiler has got a pragma that allows you to suppress
warnings generated by the compiler. Some of these pragmas are
discussed below.

(a) #pragma startup and #pragma exit: These directives allow
us to specify functions that are called upon program startup
(before main( )) or program exit (just before the program
terminates). Their usage is as follows:

void fun1() ;
void fun2() ;

#pragma startup fun
#pragma exit fun2

main()

printf ("\nInside maim” ) ;
}

void funt()

printf (“\ninside funt" ) ;
}

void fun2( )

printf ( "\nInside fun2" ) ;
}
