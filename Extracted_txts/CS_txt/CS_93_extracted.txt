Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

it has already sent along an edge. Sending flow back along an edge is equiva-
lent to decreasing the flow on the edge, which is a necessary operation in many
algorithms.

More formally, suppose that we have a flow network G = (V, E) with source s
and sink t. Let f be a flow in G, and consider a pair of vertices u,v € V. We
define the residual capacity cf (u,v) by

clu.v)—f(u.v) if(uvye EB,
cr(u,v) = 4 f(v,u) if(yueE, (26.2)
0 otherwise .

Because of our assumption that (u,v) € E implies (v,u) ¢ E, exactly one case in
equation (26.2) applies to each ordered pair of vertices.

As an example of equation (26.2), if c(u,v) = 16 and f(u,v) = 11, then we
can increase f(u,v) by up to c¢(u,v) = 5 units before we exceed the capacity
constraint on edge (u,v). We also wish to allow an algorithm to return up to 11
units of flow from v to wv, and hence c¢(v,u) = 11.

Given a flow network G = (V, E) and a flow f, the residual network of G
induced by f is Gf = (V, Ey), where

Er ={(u.v) €V x V ve¢(uyv) > 0}. (26.3)

That is, as promised above, each edge of the residual network, or residual edge,
can admit a flow that is greater than 0. Figure 26.4(a) repeats the flow network G
and flow f of Figure 26.1(b), and Figure 26.4(b) shows the corresponding residual
network Gy. The edges in E¥ are either edges in E or their reversals, and thus

|Er| <2 ||.

Observe that the residual network G+ is similar to a flow network with capacities
given by cr. It does not satisfy our definition of a flow network because it may
contain both an edge (u,v) and its reversal (v,w). Other than this difference, a
residual network has the same properties as a flow network, and we can define a
flow in the residual network as one that satisfies the definition of a flow, but with
respect to capacities cy in the network Gy.

A flow in a residual network provides a roadmap for adding flow to the original
flow network. If f is a flow in G and f’ is a flow in the corresponding residual
network Gy, we define f ¢ f’, the augmentation of flow f by f’, to be a function
from V x V to R, defined by
