the exclusive-OR relation of the variables (see the discussion at the end of Sec.
12). The squares with 1’s for the C output may be combined in a variety of
ways. One possible expression for C is
Cm ay t (ly + xyz

Realizing that x’y + xy’ = x@®y and including the expression for output, we
obtain the two Boolean expressions for the full-adder:

S=x@y@z

Cay t (yz
The logic diagram of the full-adder is drawn in Fig. 1-18. Note that the full-
adder circuit consists of two half-adders and an OR gate When used in

subsequent chapters, the full-adder (FA) will be designated by a block diagram
as shown in Fig. 1-18(b).
