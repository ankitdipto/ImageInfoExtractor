272 Let Us C

 

any given array must be of the same type. i.e. we cannot have an
array of 10 numbers, of which 5 are ints and 5 are floats.

A Simple Program Using Array

Let us try to write a program to find average marks obtained by a
class of 30 students in a test.

main()

{
int avg, sum = 0;
int i;

int marks[30] ; /* array declaration */

for (i= 0 ;i <= 29; i++)
{

printf ( â€œ\nEnter marks ") ;

scanf ("%d", &marks[i]) ; /* store data in array */
}

for (i= 0; <= 29; i++)
sum = sum + marks[i] ; /* read data from an array*/

avg = sum/ 30;
printf ( "\nAverage marks = %d", avg ) ;
}

There is a lot of new material in this program, so let us take it apart
slowly.

Array Declaration

To begin with, like other variables an array needs to be declared so
that the compiler will know what kind of an array and how large
an array we want. In our program we have done this with the
statement:
