26.2. The Ford-Fulkerson method 717

 

Figure 26.4 (a) The flow network G and flow f of Figure 26.1(b). (b) The residual network Gy
with augmenting path p shaded; its residual capacity is cf(p) = cy¢(v2.v3) = 4. Edges with
residual capacity equal to 0, such as (v1, 13), are not shown, a convention we follow in the remainder
of this section. (c) The flow in G that results from augmenting along path p by its residual capacity 4.
Edges carrying no flow, such as (v3, v2), are labeled only by their capacity, another convention we
follow throughout. (d) The residual network induced by the flow in (c).

The intuition behind this definition follows the definition of the residual network.
We increase the flow on (u,v) by f’(u,v) but decrease it by f’(v,u) because
pushing flow on the reverse edge in the residual network signifies decreasing the
flow in the original network. Pushing flow on the reverse edge in the residual
network is also known as cancellation. For example, if we send 5 crates of hockey
pucks from u to v and send 2 crates from v to u, we could equivalently (from the
perspective of the final result) just send 3 creates from u to v and none from v to u.
Cancellation of this type is crucial for any maximum-flow algorithm.

Lemma 26.1

Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s and sink t, and let f be a flow
in G. Let Gy be the residual network of G induced by /, and let f’ be a flow
in Gr. Then the function f ¢ f’ defined in equation (26.4) is a flow in G with

value |f tf") =|f|+1f'1-

Proof We first verify that f ¢ f’ obeys the capacity constraint for each edge in E
and flow conservation at each vertex in V — {s, f}.
