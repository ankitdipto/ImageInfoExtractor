More on Arrays

Array is a very popular data type with C programmers. This is
because of the convenience with which arrays lend themselves to
programming. The features which make arrays so convenient to
program would be discussed below, along with the possible pitfalls
in using them.

Array Initialisation

So far we have used arrays that did not have any values in them to
begin with. We managed to store values in them during program
execution. Let us now see how to initialize an array while
declaring it. Following are a few examples that demonstrate this.

int num[6] = { 2, 4, 12, 5, 45, 5};

int n[] ={2, 4, 12, 5, 45, 5};

float press[] = { 12.3, 34.2 -23.4, -11.3};
Note the following points carefully:

(a) Till the array elements are not given any specific values, they
are supposed to contain garbage values.

(b) Ifthe array is initialised where it is declared, mentioning the
dimension of the array is optional as in the 2" example above.

Array Elements in Memory

Consider the following array declaration:

int arr[8] ;

What happens in memory when we make this declaration? 16

bytes get immediately reserved in memory, 2 bytes each for the 8
integers (under Windows/Linux the array would occupy 32 bytes
