as each integer would occupy 4 bytes). And since the array is not
being initialized, all eight values present in it would be garbage
values. This so happens because the storage class of this array is
assumed to be auto. If the storage class is declared to be static
then all the array elements would have a default initial value as
zero. Whatever be the initial values, all the array elements woul
always be present in contiguous memory locations. This
arrangement of array elements in memory is shown in Figure 8.1.

Bounds Checking

In C there is no check to see if the subscript used for an array
exceeds the size of the array. Data entered with a subscript
exceeding the array size will simply be placed in memory outside
the array; probably on top of other data, or on the program itself.
This will lead to unpredictable results, to say the least, and there
will be no error message to warn you that you are going beyond
the array size. In some cases the computer may just hang. Thus,
the following program may turn out to be suicidal.

main()
{
int num[40], i;

for (i= 0;i <= 100; i++)
num{i] =i;
