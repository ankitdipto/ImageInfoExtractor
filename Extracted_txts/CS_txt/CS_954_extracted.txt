Chapter 8: Arrays 277

 

Thus, to see to it that we do not reach beyond the array size is
entirely the programmer’s botheration and not the compiler’s.

Passing Array Elements to a Function

Array elements can be passed to a function by calling the function
by value, or by reference. In the call by value we pass values of
array elements to the function, whereas in the call by reference we
pass addresses of array elements to the function. These two calls
are illustrated below:

/" Demonstration of call by value */
main()
{
int i;
int marks[] = { 55, 65, 75, 56, 78, 78, 90} ;

for (i=0;i<=6; i++)
display ( marks[i] ) ;
display (int m)
{

printf (°%d", m) ;
}

And here’s the output...

55 65 75 56 78 78 90

Here, we are passing an individual array element at a time to the
function display() and getting it printed in the function display( ).
Note that since at a time only one element is being passed, this
element is collected in an ordinary integer variable m, in the

function display( ).

And now the call by reference.
