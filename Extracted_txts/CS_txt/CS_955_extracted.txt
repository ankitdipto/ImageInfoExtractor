278 Let Us C

 

/* Demonstration of call by reference */
main()
{
int i;
int marks[ ] = { 55, 65, 75, 56, 78, 78, 90};

for (i= 0; <=6;i++)
disp ( &marks[i] ) ;

disp (int *n)
{

printf ("%d", "n) ;
}

And here’s the output...
55 65 75 56 78 78 90

Here, we are passing addresses of individual array elements to the
function display( ). Hence, the variable in which this address is
collected (n) is declared as a pointer variable. And since n contains
the address of array element, to print out the array element we are
using the ‘value at address’ operator (*).

Read the following program carefully. The purpose of the function
disp( ) is just to display the array elements on the screen. The
program is only partly complete. You are required to write the
function show() on your own. Try your hand at it.

main()
{
int i;
int marks[] = (55, 65, 75, 56, 78, 78, 90};

for (i=0;i<=6;i++)
disp ( &marks[i] ) ;
