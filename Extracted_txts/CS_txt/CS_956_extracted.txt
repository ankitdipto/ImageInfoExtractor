Pointers and Arrays

To be able to see what pointers have got to do with arrays, let us
first learn some pointer arithmetic. Consider the following

  

example:

main()

{
int i= 3, °x;
float j = 1.5, *y;
char k ='c,*Z;

}

 
  

printf ( "\nValue of i =
printf ( "\nValue of j =
printf ( “\nValue of k = %c", k) ;

X= 8i;

y= 8;

Z = &k;

printf ( “\nOriginal address in x = %u", x) ;
printf ( "\nOriginal address in y = %u", y ) ;
printf ( “\nOriginal address in z = %u", z ) ;
X++}

Ytt;

Z++)

 

printf ( "\nNew address in
printf ( "\nNew address in z = %u", z) ;

Here is the output of the program.
