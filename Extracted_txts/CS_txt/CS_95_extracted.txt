Chapter 26 Maximum Flow

For the capacity constraint, first observe that if (u,v) € E, then cf(v,u) =
Sf (u,v). Therefore, we have f’(v.u) < c¢(v.u) = f (u,v), and hence

(Ft f/IVQLv) = flv) + fu.v) = f"v,w) (by equation (26.4)

= fu.) + f'u.v)— flu.v) (because f’(v.u) < f(u.v))
= fur)
> 0.
In addition,
(Ft #)@.¥)
= f(u,v)+ f’u.v)— f'(v.u) (by equation (26.4))
< f(u.v) + f’u.v) (because flows are nonnegative)
<= f(u.v) +er(u.v) (capacity constraint)
f(u.v) + c(u.v) — f(u.v) — definition of cr)
c(u,v).

For flow conservation, because both f and f’ obey flow conservation, we have
that for all wu € V — {s,t},

Vt A anr) = Yfonv) + fav) = f'o,w)

“ = Y fu +D aw) -Y Poa
= > soa + > son - y fur)
= So +o" - rw, »))
= vu TA/IO.W.

where the third line follows from the second by flow conservation.

Finally, we compute the value of f + f’. Recall that we disallow antiparallel
edges in G (but not in Gy), and hence for each vertex v € V, we know that there
can be an edge (s,v) or (v,5), but never both. We define V; = {v : (s,v) € E}
to be the set of vertices with edges from s, and V. = {v : (v,s) € E} to be the
set of vertices with edges to s. We have V; U V2 C V and, because we disallow
antiparallel edges, V; N V2 = %. We now compute
