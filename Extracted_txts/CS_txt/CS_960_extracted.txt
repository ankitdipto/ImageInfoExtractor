Subtraction of one pointer from another.

One pointer variable can be subtracted from another provided
both variables point to elements of the same array. The
resulting value indicates the number of bytes separating the
corresponding array elements. This is illustrated in the
following program.

main()
{
int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 45, 67, 56, 74};
int “i,j;
i= gar];
j= &arr[5] ;

printf ("%d %d", j-i, *j-*i);
}

Here i and j have been declared as integer pointers holding
addresses of first and fifth element of the array respectively.

Suppose the array begins at location 65502, then the elements
arr[1] and arr[5] would be present at locations 65504 and
65512 respectively, since each integer in the array occupies
two bytes in memory. The expression j - i would print a value
4 and not 8. This is because j and i are pointing to locations
that are 4 integers apart. What would be the result of the
expression *j - *i? 36, since *j and *i return the values
present at addresses contained in the pointers j and i.
