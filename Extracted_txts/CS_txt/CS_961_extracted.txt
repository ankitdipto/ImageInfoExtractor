282 Let Us C

 

Pointer variables can be compared provided both variables
point to objects of the same data type. Such comparisons can
be useful when both pointer variables point to elements of the
same array. The comparison can test for either equality or
inequality. Moreover, a pointer variable can be compared with
zero (usually expressed as NULL). The following program
illustrates how the comparison is carried out.

main()

{
int arr[] = { 10, 20, 36, 72, 45, 36};
intâ€œ), *k;

printf ("The two pointers point to the same location" ) ;
else

printf ("The two pointers do not point to the same location" ) ;
}

A word of caution! Do not attempt the following operations on
pointers... they would never work out.

(a) Addition of two pointers
(b) Multiplication of a pointer with a constant
(c) Division of a pointer with a constant

Now we will try to correlate the following two facts, which we
have learnt above:

(a) Array elements are always stored in contiguous memory
locations.

(b) A pointer when incremented always points to an immediately
next location of its type.
