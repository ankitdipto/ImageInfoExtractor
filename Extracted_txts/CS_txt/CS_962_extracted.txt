Chapter 8: Arrays 283

 

Suppose we have an array num ] = { 24, 34, 12, 44, 56, 17 }. The
following figure shows how this array is located in memory.

 

 

24 34 2 44 56 W

65512 65514 65516 = 65518 65520 65522

 

 

 

Figure 8.2

Here is a program that prints out the memory locations in which
the elements of this array are stored.

main()

{
int num] = { 24, 34, 12, 44, 56, 17};
int i;

for (i=0;1<=5; i++)

printf ( â€œ\nelement no. %d ", i) ;
printf ("address = %u", &numli] ) ;
}
}

The output of this program would look like this:

element no. 0 address = 65512
element no. 1 address = 65514
element no. 2 address = 65516
element no. 3 address = 65518
element no. 4 address = 65520
element no. 5 address = 65522

Note that the array elements are stored in contiguous memory
locations, each element occupying two bytes, since it is an integer
