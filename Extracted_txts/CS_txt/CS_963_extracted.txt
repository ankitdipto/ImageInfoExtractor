array. When you run this program, you may get different
addresses, but what is certain is that each subsequent address
would be 2 bytes (4 bytes under Windows/Linux) greater than its
immediate predecessor.

Our next two programs show ways in which we can access the
elements of this array.

main()

{
int num[] = (24, 34, 12, 44, 56, 17};
int i;

for (i=O;i<=5;i++)
{
printf ("\naddress = %u ", &numfi] ) ;
printf (â€œelement = %d", numf[i] ) ;
}
}

The output of this program would be:

address = 65512 element = 24
address = 65514 element = 34
address = 65516 element = 12
address = 65518 element = 44
address = 65520 element = 56
address = 65522 element = 17

This method of accessing array elements by using subscripted
variables is already known to us. This method has in fact been
given here for easy comparison with the next method, which
accesses the array elements using pointers.

main()

int num[] = { 24, 34, 12, 44, 56, 17};
