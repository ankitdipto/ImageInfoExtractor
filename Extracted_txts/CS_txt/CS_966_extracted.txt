Chapter 8: Arrays 287

 

int i;
for (i=O;i<=n-1; i++)

printf ( "\nelement = %d", *j) ;
j++; /° increment pointer to point to next element “/
}
}

Here, the display() function is used to print out the array
elements. Note that the address of the zeroth element is being
passed to the display() function. The for loop is same as the one
used in the earlier program to access the array elements using
pointers. Thus, just passing the address of the zeroth element of the
array to a function is as good as passing the entire array to the
function. It is also necessary to pass the total number of elements
in the array, otherwise the display() function would not know
when to terminate the for loop. Note that the address of the zeroth
element (many a times called the base address) can also be passed
by just passing the name of the array. Thus, the following two
function calls are same:

display ( &num[0}, 6) ;
display (num, 6 ) ;

The Real Thing

If you have grasped the concept of storage of array elements in
memory and the arithmetic of pointers, here is some real food for
thought. Once again consider the following array.

 

 

24 34 12 44 56 17
65512 65514 65516 65518 65520 65522
