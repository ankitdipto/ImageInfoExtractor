Two Dimensional Arrays
So far we have explored arrays with only one dimension. It is also
possible for arrays to have two or more dimensions. The two-

dimensional array is also called a matrix.

Here is a sample program that stores roll number and marks
obtained by a student side by side in a matrix.

main()
{
int stud[4][2] ;
int i,j;
for (i=0;i<= 3; i++)
{
printf ("\n Enter roll no. and marks" ) ;
scanf ("%d %d", &studfi][0], &studfi][1] ) ;
}

for (i=0;i<=3; i++)
printf ( "\n%d %d", studfij[0], studfi][1] ) ;
}

There are two parts to the programâ€”in the first part through a for
loop we read in the values of roll no. and marks, whereas, in
second part through another for loop we print out these values.

Look at the scanf() statement used in the first for loop:

 

scanf ("%d %d", &stud[iJ[O], &studfi][1] ) ;
