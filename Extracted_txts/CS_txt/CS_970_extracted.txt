290 Let Us C

 

In stud [i][0] and stud[i][1] the first subscript of the variable stud,
is row number which changes for every student. The second
subscript tells which of the two columns are we talking aboutâ€”the
zeroth column which contains the roll no. or the first column
which contains the marks. Remember the counting of rows and
columns begin with zero. The complete array arrangement is
shown below.

 

 

 

 

 

col. no. 0 col. no. 1
row no. 0 1234 56
row no. 1 1212 33
row no. 2 1434 80
row no. 3 1312 78

Thus, 1234 is stored in stud[0][0], 56 is stored in stud[0][1] and
so on. The above arrangement highlights the fact that a two-
dimensional array is nothing but a collection of a number of one-
dimensional arrays placed one below the other.

In our sample program the array elements have been stored
rowwise and accessed rowwise. However, you can access the array
elements columnwise as well. Traditionally, the array elements are
being stored and accessed rowwise; therefore we would also stick
to the same strategy.
