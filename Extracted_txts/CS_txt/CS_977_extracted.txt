And here is the output...

Here p is a pointer to an array of two integers. Note that the
parentheses in the declaration of p are necessary. Absence of them
would make p an array of 2 integer pointers. Array of pointers is
covered in a later section in this chapter. In the outer for loop each
time we store the address of a new one-dimensional array. Thus
first time through this loop p would contain the address of the
zeroth 1-D array. This address is then assigned to an integer
pointer pint. Lastly, in the inner for loop using the pointer pint we
