have printed the individual elements of the 1-D array to which p is
pointing.

But why should we use a pointer to an array to print elements of a
2-D array. Is there any situation where we can appreciate its usage
better? The entity pointer to an array is immensely useful when we
need to pass a 2-D array to a function. This is discussed in the next
section.

Passing 2-D Array to a Function

There are three ways in which we can pass a 2-D array to a
function. These are illustrated in the following program.

show (a, 3, 4);

print (a, 3, 4);
}
display (int *q, int row, int col)
{

int i,j;

for (i=0;i< row; i++)
{
for (j=0;j<col; j++)
printf ("%d", *(q+i*col+j));
