where the second line follows because (f ¢ f’)(w, x) is 0 if (w,x) ¢ E. We now
apply the definition of f ¢ f’ to equation (26.5), and then reorder and group terms
to obtain

In equation (26.6), we can extend all four summations to sum over V, since each
additional term has value 0. (Exercise 26.2-1 asks you to prove this formally.) We

thus have
Ifthl = Vfow-Y fo.9y+ Ve row- PFs) 6.7)

Augmenting paths

Given a flow network G = (V,£) and a flow f, an augmenting path p is a
simple path from s to f in the residual network Gy. By the definition of the resid-
ual network, we may increase the flow on an edge (u,v) of an augmenting path
by up to c¢(u, v) without violating the capacity constraint on whichever of (u,v)
and (v, 1) is in the original flow network G.

The shaded path in Figure 26.4(b) is an augmenting path. Treating the residual
network G+ in the figure as a flow network, we can increase the flow through each
edge of this path by up to 4 units without violating a capacity constraint, since the
smallest residual capacity on this path is cf (v2, v3) = 4. We call the maximum
amount by which we can increase the flow on each edge in an augmenting path p
the residual capacity of p, given by

cf(p) = min {cf (u,v) : (u,v) is on p} «
