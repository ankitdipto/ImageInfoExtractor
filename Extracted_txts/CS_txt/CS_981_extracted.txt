In the display() function we have collected the base address of the
2-D array being passed to it in an ordinary int pointer. Then
through the two for loops using the expression * (q +i* col+j)
we have reached the appropriate element in the array. Suppose i is
equal to 2 and j is equal to 3, then we wish to reach the element
a[2][3]. Let us see whether the expression * (q +i* col +j ) does
give this element or not. Refer Figure 8.7 to understand this.

 

 

1 31 4 5 | 6 7| 8 9 0 1 6
65502 ...04 ...06 ...08 ...10 ...12 ...14...16 ...18 ...20 ...22 ...24

 

 

 

Figure 8.7

The expression * (q +i * col +j ) becomes * ( 65502 +2 * 4 +3).
This turns out to be * (65502 + 11 ). Since 65502 is address of an
integer, * ( 65502 + 11 ) turns out to be * (65524). Value at this
address is 6. This is indeed same as a[2][3]. A more general
formula for accessing each array element would be:

â€œ(base address + row no. * no. of columns + column no. )

In the show( ) function we have defined q to be a pointer to an
array of 4 integers through the declaration:
