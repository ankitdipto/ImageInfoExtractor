SECTION 6.7 Subroutines 201

totransfer one operand and to receive the result. The other operandisinserted
in the location following the BSA instruction This is demonstrated in the
program of Table 6-17. The first operand in location X is loaded into the AC.
The second operand is stored in location 202 following the BSA instruction.
After the branch, the first location in the subroutine holds the number 202
Note that in this case, 202 is not the return address but the address of the
second operand. The subroutine starts performing the OR operation by com-
plementing the first operand in the AC and storing it in a temporary location
‘TMP. The second operand is loaded into the AC by an indirect instruction at
location OR. Remember that location OR contains the number 202. When the
instructionrefersto it indirectly, the operand at location 202 is loaded into the
AC. This operand is complemented and then ANDed with the operand stored
in TMP. Complementing the result forms the OR operation

The return from the subroutine must be manipulated so that the main
programcontinues from location 203wherethe nextinstruction islocated. This,
is accomplished by incrementing location OR with the ISZ instruction. Now
location OR holds the number 203 and an indirect BUN instruction causes a
return to the proper place.

Itis possible to have more than one operand following the BSA instruc-
