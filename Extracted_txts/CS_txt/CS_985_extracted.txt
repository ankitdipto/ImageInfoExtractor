302 Let Us C

 

int “p[]={a,a+1,a+2,a+3,a+4};

printf ("\n%u %u %d", p, “p, * ("p)):
}

I would leave it for you to figure out the output of this program.

Three-Dimensional Array

We aren’t going to show a programming example that uses a three-
dimensional array. This is because, in practice, one rarely uses this
array. However, an example of initializing a three-dimensional
array will consolidate your understanding of subscripts:

int arr[3)[4][2] = {

{2,4},
{7,8},
{3,4},
{5,6}

{7,6},
{3,4},

A three-dimensional array can be thought of as an array of arrays
of arrays. The outer array has three elements, each of which is a
