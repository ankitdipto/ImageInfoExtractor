Chapter 8: Arrays 303

 

two-dimensional array of four one-dimensional arrays, each of
which contains two integers. In other words, a one-dimensional
array of two elements is constructed first. Then four such one-
dimensional arrays are placed one below the other to give a two-
dimensional array containing four rows. Then, three such two-
dimensional arrays are placed one behind the other to yield a three-
dimensional array containing three 2-dimensional arrays. In the
array declaration note how the commas have been given. Figure
8.9 would possibly help you in visualising the situation better.

Again remember that the arrangement shown above is only
conceptually true. In memory the same array elements are stored
linearly as shown in Figure 8.10.
