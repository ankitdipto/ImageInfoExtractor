310 Let Us C

 

(d) Implement the following procedure to generate prime
numbers from 1 to 100 into a program. This procedure is
called sieve of Eratosthenes.

step 1 Fill an array num[100] with numbers from 1 to 100

step 2 Starting with the second entry in the array, set all its
multiples to zero.

step 3 Proceed to the next non-zero element and set all its
multiples to zero.

step 4 Repeat step 3 till you have set up the multiples of
all the non-zero elements to zero

step 5 At the conclusion of step 4, all the non-zero entries
left in the array would be prime numbers, so print
out these numbers.

[E] What would be the output of the following programs:

(a) main()
{
int bl] ={10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int i;
for (i=0;i<=4; i++)
printf ( "\n%d" *(b +i) );

}
(b) main()

{
int b[] = {0, 20, 0, 40, 5};
int i,*k;
k=b;
for (i=0;1<=4; i++)
{

printf ( "\n%d" *k) ;
