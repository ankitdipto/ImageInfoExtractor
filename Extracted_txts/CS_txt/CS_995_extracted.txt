CHAPTER SIX Programming the Basic Computer

tion. The subroutine must increment the return address stored in its first
location for each operand that it extracts from the calling program. Moreover,
the calling program can reserve one or more locations for the subroutine to
return results that are computed. The first location in the subroutine must be
incremented for these locations as well, before the return. If there is a large
amount of data to be transferred, the data can be placed in a block of storage
and the address of the first item in the block is then used as the linking
parameter.

Asubroutine that moves ablock of data starting at address 100into ablock
starting with address 200 is listed in Table 6-18. The length of the block is 16
words. The first introduction isa branch to subroutine MVE. The first part of
the subroutine transfers the three parameters 100, 200 and — 16 from the main
program and places them in its own storage location. The items are retrieved
from their blocks by the use of two pointers. The counter ensures that only 16
items are moved. When the subroutine completes its operation, the data
required is in the block starting from the location 200. The return to the main
program is to the HLT instruction.
