Figure 26.5 A cut (S,7) in the flow network of Figure 26.1(b), where S = {s,v1,v2} and
T ={v3,v4,t}. The vertices in S are black, and the vertices in T are white. The net flow
across (S, T) is f(S, T) = 19, and the capacity is c(S, 7) = 26.

The capacity of the cut (S,T) is
c(S.T) = > Yo etu.v). (26.10)

ues veT
A minimum cut of a network is a cut whose capacity is minimum over all cuts of
the network.

The asymmetry between the definitions of flow and capacity of a cut is inten-
tional and important. For capacity, we count only the capacities of edges going
from S to T, ignoring edges in the reverse direction. For flow, we consider the
flow going from S to T minus the flow going in the reverse direction from T to S.
The reason for this difference will become clear later in this section.

Figure 26.5 shows the cut ({s,v1.V2}.{¥3.V4.f}) in the flow network of Fig-
ure 26.1(b). The net flow across this cut is

F (V1.3) + fv2,¥4) — f (3,2) = 124+11-4
19,
and the capacity of this cut is

12+ 14
26.

(V1, V3) + C(V2, V4)

The following lemma shows that, for a given flow /’, the net flow across any cut
is the same, and it equals | f|, the value of the flow.

Lemma 26.4
Let f be a flow in a flow network G with source s and sink f, and let (S, 7) be any
cut of G. Then the net flow across (S,T) is f(S.T) = |f|-
