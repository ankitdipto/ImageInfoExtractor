Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths

  

Figure 24.2 (a) A weighted, directed graph with shortest-path weights from source s. (b) The
shaded edges form a shortest-paths tree rooted at the source s. (¢) Another shortest-paths tree with
the same root.

Shortest paths are not necessarily unique, and neither are shortest-paths trees. For
example, Figure 24.2 shows a weighted, directed graph and two shortest-paths trees
with the same root.

Relaxation

The algorithms in this chapter use the technique of relaxation. For each vertex
v € V, we maintain an attribute v.d, which is an upper bound on the weight of
a shortest path from source s to v. We call v.d a shortest-path estimate. We
initialize the shortest-path estimates and predecessors by the following @(V)-time
procedure:

INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, 5)
1 for each vertex v € G.V

2 v.d = 00
3 v. = NIL
4 sd=0

After initialization, we have v.2 = NIL for all v € V,s.d = 0, and v.d = oo for
veV —{s}.

The process of relaxing an edge (u,v) consists of testing whether we can im-
prove the shortest path to v found so far by going through wu and, if so, updat-
ing v.d and v.z. A relaxation step! may decrease the value of the shortest-path

 

1Tt may seem strange that the term “relaxation” is used for an operation that tightens an upper bound.
The use of the term is historical. The outcome of a relaxation step can be viewed as a relaxation
of the constraint v.d < u.d + w(w,v), which, by the triangle inequality (Lemma 24.10), must be
satisfied if u.d = 8(s, u) and v.d = 8(s, v). That is, if v.d < u.d + w(w,v), there is no “pressure”
to satisfy this constraint, so the constraint is “relaxed.”
