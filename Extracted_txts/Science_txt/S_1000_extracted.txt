FIGURE 49.13

A myelinated neuron. Many dendrites
arise from the cell body, as does a
single long axon. In some neurons
specialized for rapid signal conduction,
the axon is encased in a myelin sheath
that is interrupted at intervals. At its far
end, the axon may branch to terminate
on more than one cell.

SENSORY NEURONS

Typical Location

Eyes; ears; surface of skin

Function

from sensory receptors to CNS

Characteristic Cell Types
Rods and cones; muscle stretch receptors

MOTOR NEURONS

Typical Location

Brain and spinal cord

Function

Stimulate muscles and glands; conduct impulses out of CNS toward muscles and glands
Characteristic Cell Types

Motor neurons

ASSOCIATION NEURONS

Typical Location

Brain and spinal cord

Function

Integrate information; conduct impulses between neurons within CNS
