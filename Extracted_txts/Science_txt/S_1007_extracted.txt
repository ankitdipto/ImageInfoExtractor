The Sliding Filament Mechanism of
Contraction

Each skeletal muscle contains numerous muscle fibers, as
described in chapter 49. Each muscle fiber encloses a bun-
dle of 4 to 20 elongated structures called myofibrils. Each
myofibril, in turn, is composed of thick and thin myofila-
ments (figure 50.7). The muscle fiber is striated (has cross-
striping) because its myofibrils are striated, with dark and
light bands. The banding pattern results from the organiza-
tion of the myofilaments within the myofibril. The thick
myofilaments are stacked together to produce the dark

bands, called A bands; the thin filaments alone are found in
the light bands, or I bands.

Each I band in a myofibril is divided in half by a disc of
protein, called a Z Jine because of its appearance in electron
micrographs. The thin filaments are anchored to these
discs of proteins that form the Z lines. If you look at an
electron micrograph of a myofibril (figure 50.8), you will
see that the structure of the myofibril repeats from Z line
to Z line. This repeating structure, called a sarcomere, is
the smallest subunit of muscle contraction.

The thin filaments stick partway into the stack of thick
filaments on each side of an A band, but, in a resting

is composed of many myofibrils, which are each, in turn, composed of myofilaments.
