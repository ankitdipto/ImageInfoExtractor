muscle, do not project all the way to
the center of the A band. As a result,
the center of an A band (called an H
band) is lighter than each side, with
its interdigitating thick and thin fila-
ments. This appearance of the sar-
comeres changes when the muscle
contracts.

A muscle contracts and shortens be-
cause its myofibrils contract and
shorten. When this occurs, the myofil-
aments do mot shorten; instead, the
thin filaments slide deeper into the A
bands (figure 50.9). This makes the H
bands narrower until, at maximal
shortening, they disappear entirely. It
also makes the I bands narrower, be-
cause the dark A bands are brought
closer together. This is the sliding fil-
ament mechanism of contraction.

FIGURE 50.8
An electron micrograph of a skeletal muscle fiber. The Z lines that serve as the borders
of the sarcomeres are clearly seen within each myofibril. The thick filaments comprise the A
bands; the thin filaments are within the I bands and stick partway into the A bands,
overlapping with the thick filaments. There is no overlap of thick and thin filaments at the
central region of an A band, which is therefore lighter in appearance. This is the H band.

the centers of the sarcomeres, the Z lines are brought closer together. (1) Relaxed muscle; (2) partially contracted muscle.
