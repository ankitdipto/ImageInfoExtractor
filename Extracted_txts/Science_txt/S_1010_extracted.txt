FIGURE 50.12

â€˜The interaction of thick and thin filaments in striated muscle sarcomeres. The heads on the two ends of the thick filaments are
oriented in opposite directions (a), so that the cross-bridges pull the thin filaments and the Z. lines on each side of the sarcomere toward
the center. (6) This sliding of the filaments produces muscle contraction.

The cross-bridge cycle in muscle
contraction. (2) With ADP and P;
attached to the myosin head, (#) the
head is in a conformation that can
bind to actin and form a cross-
bridge. (6) Binding causes the myosin
head to assume a more bent
conformation, moving the thin
filament along the thick filament (to
the left in this diagram) and releasing
ADP and P;. (d) Binding of ATP to
the head detaches the cross-bridge;
cleavage of ATP into ADP and P;
puts the head into its original
conformation, allowing the cycle to
begin again.
