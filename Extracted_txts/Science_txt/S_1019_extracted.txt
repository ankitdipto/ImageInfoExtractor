¢ There are three types of skeleton: hydrostatic
skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons.

* Bone is formed by the secretion of an organic matrix
by osteoblasts; this organic matrix becomes calcified.

1, What are the two major
components of the extracellular 7
matrix in bone? What structural
properties does each component
have? How do the two
components combine to make v
bone resistant to fracture? a

thin filaments of actin.

* There are small cross-bridges of myosin that extend
out toward the actin; the cross-bridges are activated
by the hydrolysis of ATP so that it can bind to actin
and undergo a power stroke that causes the sliding of
the myofilaments.

¢ When Ca** binds to troponin, the tropomyosin shifts
position in the thin filament, allowing the cross-
bridges to bind to actin and undergo a power stroke.

* The release of Ca** from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
is stimulated by impulses in the muscle fiber
produced by neural stimulation.

*¢ Slow-twitch fibers are adapted for aerobic respiration
and are resistant to fatigue; fast-twitch fibers can pro-
vide power quickly but produce lactic acid and fatigue
quickly.

* Cardiac muscle cells have gap junctions that permit
the spread of electric impulses from one cell to the
next.

* Cardiac and smooth muscles are involuntary and reg-
ulated by autonomic nerves; the contractions are au-
tomatically produced in cardiac muscle and some
smooth muscles.

¢ Animals have adapted modes of locomotion to three
different environments: water, land, and air.

5. Describe the steps involved
in the cross-bridge cycle. What
functions does ATP perform in
the cycle?

6. Describe the steps involved
in excitation-contraction
coupling. What functions do
acetylcholine and Ca++ perform
in this process?

7. How does a somatic motor
neuron stimulate a muscle fiber
to contract?

8. What is the difference
between a muscle twitch and
tetanus?

9. Why can’t a myocardium
produce a sustained contraction?

10. How does smooth muscle
differ from skeletal muscle in
terms of thick and thin filament
organization, the role of Ca++ in
contraction, and the effect of
stretching on the muscle’s ability
to contract?
