Intestinal microvilli. Microvilli, shown in an electron
micrograph, are very densely clustered, giving the small intestine
an enormous surface area important in efficient absorption of the
digestion products.

FIGURE 51.14

Brush border enzymes. These enzymes, which are labeled “EN”
in this diagram, are part of the plasma membrane of the microvilli
in the small intestine. They catalyze many of the terminal steps in
digestion.
