Hormonal control of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrin is secreted by the mucosa of the stomach and stimulates the secretion of
pepsinogen (which is converted into pepsin) and HCI. The duodenum secretes three hormones: cholecystokinin (CCK), which stimulates
contraction of the gallbladder and secretion of pancreatic enzymes; secretin, which stimulates secretion of pancreatic bicarbonate; and an
enterogastrone, which inhibits stomach emptying.
