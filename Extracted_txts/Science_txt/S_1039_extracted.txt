Summary

51.1 Animals employ a digestive system to prepare food for assimilation by cells.

 

¢ The digestive system of vertebrates consists of a
gastrointestinal tract and accessory digestive organs.

¢ Different regions of the digestive tract display
specializations of structure and function.

1. What are the layers that
make up the wall of the
vertebrate gastrointestinal tract?
What type of tissue is found in
each layer?

51.2 Food is ingested, swallowed, and transported to the stomach.

 

* Art Activity:
Digestive tract wall

* Digestion overview

 

¢ The teeth of carnivores are different from those of
herbivores

¢ The esophagus contracts in peristaltic waves to drive
the swallowed food to the stomach.

* Cells of the gastric mucosa secrete hydrochloric acid,
which activates pepsin, an enzyme that promotes the
partial hydrolysis of ingested proteins.

2. How does tooth structure
vary among carnivores,
herbivores, and omnivores?

3. What normally prevents
regurgitation in humans, and
why can’t horses regurgitate?

4, What inorganic substance is
secreted by parietal cells?

51.3. The small and large intestines have very different functions.

© The duodenum receives pancreatic juice and bile,
which help digest the chyme that arrives from the
stomach through the pyloric valve.

* Digestive enzymes in the small intestine finish the
breakdown of food into molecules that can be
absorbed by the small intestine.

¢ The large intestine absorbs water and ions, as well as
certain organic molecules such as vitamin K; the
remaining material passes out of the anus.

51.4 Accessory organs, neural stimulation, and endocrine secretions assist in digestion.

5. How are the products of
protein and carbohydrate
digestion absorbed across the
intestinal wall, and where do
they go after they are absorbed?

6. What anatomical and
behavioral specializations do
ruminants have for making use
of microorganisms?

* Stomach to small

digestion

 

¢ Pancreatic juice contains bicarbonate to neutralize
the acid chyme from the stomach. Bile contains bile
pigment and bile salts, which emulsify fat. The liver
metabolizes toxins and hormones that are delivered to
it in the hepatic portal vein; the liver also helps to
regulate the blood glucose concentration.

¢ The stomach secretes the hormone gastrin, and the
small intestine secretes various hormones that help to
regulate the digestive system.

7. What are the main exocrine
secretions of the pancreas, and
what are their functions?

8. What is the function of bile
salts in digestion?

9. Describe the role of gastrin
and secretin in digestion.

51.5 All animals require food energy and essential nutrients.

 

* Art Activity:
Digestive system

* formation of
gallstones

 

© The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the lowest level of
energy consumption of the body.

* Vitamins, minerals, and the essential amino acids and
fatty acids must be supplied in the diet.

the difference between an
essential amino acid and any
other amino acid?
