‘Transmit information

“Self” recognition

Tissue recognition

How It Works

Excludes water-soluble
molecules from nonpolar
interior of bilayer

“Escort” molecules through
the membrane ina series of
conformational changes

Create a tunnel that acts as a
passage through membrane

Signal molecules bind to cell-
surface portion of the receptor
protein; this alters the portion
of the receptor protein within
the cell, inducing activity
Form supporting scaffold
beneath membrane,
anchored to both membrane
and cytoskeleton

Proteins line coated pits and
facilitate binding to specific
molecules

Create a protein/carbohydrate
chain shape characteristic of
individual

Create a lipid/carbohydrate

Example

Bilayer of cell is
impermeable to water-
soluble molecules, like
glucose

Glycophorin carrier for
sugar transport

Sodium and potassium
channels in nerve cells

Specific receptors bind

2. Transmembrane proteins. A major component of
every membrane is a collection of proteins that float
on or in the lipid bilayer. These proteins provide pas-
sageways that allow substances and information to
cross the membrane. Many membrane proteins are
not fixed in position; they can move about, as the
phospholipid molecules do. Some membranes are
crowded with proteins, while in others, the proteins
are more sparsely distributed.

3. Network of supporting fibers.
structurally supported by intracellular proteins that
reinforce the membrane’s shape. For example, a red
blood cell has a characteristic biconcave shape because
a scaffold of proteins called spectrin links proteins in
the plasma membrane with actin filaments in the cell’s
cytoskeleton. Membranes use networks of other pro-
teins to control the lateral movements of some key
membrane proteins, anchoring them to specific sites.

4. Exterior proteins and glycolipids. Membrane
sections assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum,
transfer to the Golgi complex, and then are trans-
ported to the plasma membrane. The endoplasmic
reticulum adds chains of sugar molecules to mem-
brane proteins and lipids, creating a “sugar coating”
called the glycocalyx that extends from the membrane
on the outside of the cell only. Different cell types ex-
hibit different varieties of these glycoproteins and
glycolipids on their surfaces, which act as cell identity
markers.

 

The fluid mosaic model proposes that membrane
proteins are embedded within the lipid bilayer.
Membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer within
which proteins are anchored. Plasma membranes are
supported by a network of fibers and coated on the
exterior with cell identity markers.
