© Vertebrates have a closed circulation, where the
blood stays within vessels as it travels away from and
back to the heart.

¢ The circulatory system serves a variety of functions,
including transport, regulation, and protection.

1. What is the difference
between a closed circulatory
system and an open circulatory
system? In what types of animals
would you find each?

52.2 A network of vessels transports blood through the body.

¢ Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. A variety of
plasma proteins, ions, metabolites, wastes, and
hormones are dissolved in the plasma.

* Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, contain hemoglobin
and function to transport oxygen; the leukocytes, or
white blood cells, function in immunological
defenses.

¢ The heart pumps blood into arteries, which branch
into smaller arterioles.

* Blood from the arterial system empties into
capillaries with thin walls; all exchanges between the
blood and tissues pass across the walls of capillaries.

© Blood returns to the heart in veins, which have one-
way valves to ensure that blood travels toward the
heart only.

¢ Lymphatic vessels return interstitial fluid to the
venous system.

2. What are the major
components of blood plasma?

3. Describe the structure of
arteries and veins, explaining
their similarities and differences.
Why do arteries differ in
structure from veins?

4, What is the relationship
between vessel diameter and the
resistance to blood flow? How

do the arterial trees adjust their
resistance to flow?

5. What drives the flow of fluid
within the lymphatic system, and
in what direction does the fluid
flow?

*¢ The fish heart consists of four chambers in a row; the
beat originates in the sinus venosus and spreads
through the atrium, ventricle, and conus arteriosus.

* In the circulation of fishes, blood from the heart goes
to the gills and then to the rest of the body before

returning to the heart; in terrestrial vertebrates, blood

returns from the lungs to the heart before it is
pumped to the body.

6. Describe the pattern of
circulation through a fish and an
amphibian, and compare the
structure of their hearts. What
new circulatory pattern
accompanies the evolution of
lungs?
