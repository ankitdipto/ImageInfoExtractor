Examining Cell
Membranes

Biologists examine the delicate, filmy struc-
ture of a cell membrane using electron mi-
croscopes that provide clear magnification
to several thousand times. We discussed
two types of electron microscopes in chap-
ter 5: the transmission electron microscope
(TEM) and the scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM). When examining cell mem-
branes with electron microscopy, speci-
mens must be prepared for viewing.

In one method of preparing a specimen,
the tissue of choice is embedded in a hard
matrix, usually some sort of epoxy (figure
6.6). The epoxy block is then cut with a
microtome, a machine with a very sharp
blade that makes incredibly thin slices.
The knife moves up and down as the spec-
imen advances toward it, causing transpar-
ent “epoxy shavings” less than 1 microme-
ter thick to peel away from the block of
tissue. These shavings are placed on a grid
and a beam of electrons is directed
through the grid with the TEM. At the
high magnification an electron microscope
provides, resolution is good enough to re-
veal the double layers of a membrane.

Freeze-fracturing a specimen is another
way to visualize the inside of the mem-
brane. The tissue is embedded in a
medium and quick-frozen with liquid ni-
trogen. The frozen tissue is then “tapped”
with a knife, causing a crack between the
phospholipid layers of membranes. Pro-
teins, carbohydrates, pits, pores, channels,
or any other structure affiliated with the
membrane will pull apart (whole, usually)
and stick with one side of the split mem-
brane. A very thin coating of platinum is
then evaporated onto the fractured surface
forming a replica of “cast” of the surface.
Once the topography of the membrane has
been preserved in the “cast,” the actual tis-
sue is dissolved away, and the “cast” is ex-
amined with electron microscopy, creating
a strikingly different view of the mem-
brane (see figure 5.100).

Visualizing a plasma membrane
requires a very powerful electron
microscope. Electrons can either be
passed through a sample or bounced
off it.

directing a beam of electrons
through the grid in the transmission
electron microscope (TEM).

allows detailed examination of
