‘The regulation of breathing by chemoreceptors. Peripheral and central chemoreceptors sense a fall in the pH of blood and
cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, when the blood carbon dioxide levels rise as a result of inadequate breathing. In response, they stimulate
the respiratory control center in the medulla oblongata, which directs an increase in breathing. Asa result, the blood carbon dioxide

concentration is returned to normal, completing the negative feedback loop.
