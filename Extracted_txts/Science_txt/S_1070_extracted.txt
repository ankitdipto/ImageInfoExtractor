Because arterial blood still contains 97% oxyhemoglobin
(ventilation increases proportionately with exercise), the
amount of oxygen unloaded is now 62% (97% minus
35%), instead of the 22% at rest. In addition to this func-
tion, the oxygen reserve also ensures that the blood con-
tains enough oxygen to maintain life for four to five min-
utes if breathing is interrupted or if the heart stops
pumping.

Oxygen transport in the blood is affected by other con-
ditions. The CO? produced by metabolizing tissues as a
product of aerobic respiration combines with HO to ulti-
mately form bicarbonate and H*, lowering the pH of the
blood. This reaction occurs primarily inside red blood
cells, where the lowered pH reduces hemoglobin’s affinity
for oxygen and thus causes it to release oxygen more read-
ily. The effect of pH on hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen
is known as the Bohr effect and is shown graphically by a
shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right
(figure 53.172). Increasing temperature has a similar affect
on hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen (figure 53.17b) Be-
cause skeletal muscles produce carbon dioxide more
rapidly during exercise and active muscles produce heat,
the blood unloads a higher percentage of the oxygen it
carries during exercise.

 

Deoxyhemoglobin combines with oxygen in the lungs
to form oxyhemoglobin, which dissociates in the tissue
capillaries to release its oxygen. The degree to which
the loading reaction occurs depends on ventilation; the
degree of unloading is influenced by such factors as pH
and temperature.

FIGURE 53.16

The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Hemoglobin combines
with O, in the lungs, and this oxygenated blood is carried by
arteries to the body cells. After oxygen is removed from the blood
to support cell respiration, the blood entering the veins contains
less oxygen. The difference in O, content between arteries and
veins during rest and exercise shows how much OQ) was unloaded
to the tissues.

FIGURE 53.17

‘The effect of pH and temperature on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Lower blood pH (a) and higher blood temperatures
(d) shift the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, facilitating oxygen unloading. This can be seen as a lowering of the
oxyhemoglobin percent saturation from 60 to 40% in the example shown, indicating that the difference of 20% more oxygen is unloaded

to the tissues.
