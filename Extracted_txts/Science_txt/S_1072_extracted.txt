CO, diffuses out from red blood cells
into the alveolar spaces of the lung,
while O, diffuses into red blood cells
from airin the lungs.

 

 

 

Oxygen-poor blood is carried back to
the heart and pumped to the lungs.

super nitric oxide as NO into the blood, making blood
vessels expand because NO acts as a relaxing agent. Or,
hemoglobin can trap any excess of NO on its iron atoms
left vacant by the release of oxygen, causing blood vessels
to constrict. When the red blood cells return to the lungs,
hemoglobin dumps its CO) and the regular form of NO
bound to the iron atoms. It is then ready to pick up O2

 

  
  

0, diffuses out from red blood cells

Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in three
ways: dissolved in the plasma, bound to hemoglobin,
and the majority as bicarbonate in the plasma following
an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the red blood cells.
Nitric oxide is also transported in the blood providing
yet another explanation of NO actions on blood vessels.
