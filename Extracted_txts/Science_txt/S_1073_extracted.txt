¢ The factors that influence the rate of diffusion,
surface area, concentration gradient, and diffusion
distance, are described by Fick’s Law.

* Animals have evolved to maximize the diffusion rate
across respiratory membranes by increasing the
respiratory surface area, increasing the concentration
gradient across the membrane, or decreasing the
diffusion distance.

1. Approximately what
percentage of dry air is oxygen,
and what percentage is carbon
dioxide?

2. Why is it that only very small
organisms can satisfy their
respiratory requirements by
direct diffusion to all cells from
the body surface?

53.2 Gills are used for respiration by aquatic vertebrates.

* As water flows past a gill’s lamellae, it comes close to
blood flowing in an opposite, or countercurrent,
direction; this maximizes the concentration difference
between the two fluids, thereby maximizing the
diffusion of gases.

3. What is countercurrent flow,
and how does it help make the
fish gill the most efficient
respiratory organ?

53.3 Lungs are used for respiration by terrestrial vertebrates.

 

* Reptiles, birds, and mammals use negative pressure
breathing; air is taken into the lungs when the lung
volume is expanded to create a partial vacuum.

¢ Mammals have lungs composed of millions of alveoli,
where gas exchange occurs; this is very efficient, but
because inspiration and expiration occur through the
same airways, new air going into the lungs is mixed
with some old air.

53.4 Mammalian breathing is a dynamic process.

4. How do amphibians get air
into their lungs? How do other
terrestrial vertebrates get air into
their lungs?

5. What two features in birds
make theirs the most efficient of
all terrestrial respiratory
systems?

¢ The lungs are covered with a wet membrane that
sticks to the wet membrane lining the thoracic cavity,
so the lungs expand as the chest expands through
muscular contractions.

¢ Breathing is controlled by centers in the medulla
oblongata of the brain; breathing is stimulated by a
rise in blood COp, and consequent fall in blood pH,
as sensed by chemoreceptors located in the aorta and
carotid artery.

53.5 Blood transports oxygen and carbon dioxide.

6. How are the lungs connected
to and supported within the
thoracic cavity?

7. How does the brain control
inspiration and expiration? How
do peripheral and central
chemoreceptors influence the
brain’s control of breathing?

 

* Boyle’s Law

* Breathing

* Mechanics of
ventilation

* Control of respiration

 

* Hemoglobin loads with oxygen in the lungs; this
oxyhemoglobin then unloads oxygen as the blood
goes through the systemic capillaries.

* Carbon dioxide combines with water as the carbon
dioxide is transported to the lungs for exhalation.

8. In what form does most of the
carbon dioxide travel in the
blood? How and where is this
molecule produced?
