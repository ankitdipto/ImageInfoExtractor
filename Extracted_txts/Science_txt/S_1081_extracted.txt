Action Potentials

Generation of Action Potentials

If the plasma membrane is depolarized slightly, an oscillo-
scope will show a small upward deflection of the line that
soon decays back to the resting membrane potential. These
small changes in membrane potential are called graded po-
tentials because their amplitudes depend on the strength of
the stimulus. Graded potentials can be either depolarizing
or hyperpolarizing and can add together to amplify or re-
duce their effects, just as two waves add to make one bigger
one when they meet in synchrony or cancel each other out
when a trough meets with a crest. The ability of graded po-
tentials to combine is called summation (figure 54.9). Once
a particular level of depolarization is reached (about -55
mV in mammalian axons), however, a nerve impulse, or ac-
tion potential, is produced. The level of depolarization
needed to produce an action potential is called the thresh-
old.

A depolarization that reaches or exceeds the threshold
opens both the Nat and the K* channels, but the Na* chan-
nels open first. The rapid diffusion of Nat into the cell
shifts the membrane potential toward the equilibrium po-
tential for Na* (+60 mV—recall that the positive sign indi-
cates that the membrane reverses polarity as Na* rushes in).

Graded potentials. (1) A weak excitatory stimulus, E), elicits a
smaller depolarization than (2) a stronger stimulus, E>. (3) An
inhibitory stimulus, I, produces a hyperpolarization. (4) Because
graded potentials can summate, if all three stimuli occur very close
together, the resulting polarity change will be the algebraic sum of
the three changes individually.

The action potential. (/) At resting membrane potential, some K* channels are open. (2) In response to a stimulus, the cell begins to
depolarize, and once the threshold level is reached, an action potential is produced. (3) Rapid depolarization occurs (the rising portion of
the spike) because sodium channels open, allowing Nat to diffuse into the axon. (4) At the top of the spike, Na* channels close, and K+
channels that were previously closed begin to open. (5) With the K+ channels open, repolarization occurs because of the diffusion of K+ out
of the axon. (6) An undershoot occurs before the membrane returns to its original resting potential.
