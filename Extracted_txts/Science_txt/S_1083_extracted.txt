Saltatory Conduction.

Action potentials are conducted without decrement (with-
out decreasing in amplitude); thus, the last action potential
at the end of the axon is just as large as the first action po-
tential. The velocity of conduction is greater if the diame-
ter of the axon is large or if the axon is myelinated (table
54.2). Myelinated axons conduct impulses more rapidly
than nonmyelinated axons because the action potentials in
myelinated axons are only produced at the nodes of Ran-
vier. One action potential still serves as the depolarization
stimulus for the next, but the depolarization at one node
must spread to the next before the voltage-gated channels
can be opened. The impulses therefore seem to jump from
node to node (figure 54.12) in a process called saltatory
conduction (Latin sa/tare, “to jump”).

To see how saltatory conduction speeds nervous trans-
mission, return for a moment to the “wave” analogy used
on the previous page to describe propagation of an action
potential. The “wave” moves across the seats of a crowded
stadium as fans standing up in one section trigger the next
section to stand up in turn. Because the “wave” will skip
sections of empty bleachers, it actually
progresses around the stadium even
faster with more empty sections. The
wave doesn’t have to wait for the miss-
ing people to stand, simply “jumping”
the gaps—just as saltatory conduction
jumps the nonconduction “gaps” of
myelin between exposed nodes.

The rapid inward diffusion of Na*
followed by the outward diffusion
of K* produces a rapid change in
the membrane potential called an
action potential. Action potentials
are all-or-none events and cannot
summate. Action potentials are
regenerated along an axon as one
action potential serves as the
depolarization stimulus for the next
action potential.

Saltatory conduction in a myelinated axon. Action potentials are only produced at the
nodes of Ranvier in a myelinated axon. One node depolarizes the next node so that the
action potentials can skip between nodes. As a result, saltatory (“leaping”) conduction in a
myelinated axon is more rapid than conduction in an unmyelinated axon.
