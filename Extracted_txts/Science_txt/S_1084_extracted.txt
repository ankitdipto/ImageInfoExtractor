54.3 Neurons form junctions called synapses with other cells.

Structure of Synapses

An action potential passing down an axon eventually
reaches the end of the axon and all of its branches. These

branches may form junctions with the dendrites of other

 

 
   
   
 
 
  
   
   
 

neurons, with muscle cells, or with gland cells. Such inter- â€˜Axon Mitochondria
cellular junctions are called synapses. The neuron whose terminal
axon transmits action potentials to the synapse is the presy-
naptic cell, while the cell on the other side of the synapse is
the postsynaptic cell. Although the presynaptic and postsy- Synaptic
naptic cells may appear to touch when the synapse is seen vesicle
under a light microscope, examination with an electron mi- .
croscope reveals that most synapses have a synaptic cleft, a / Synaptic
narrow space that separates these two cells (figure 54.13). Postsynaptic

The end of the presynaptic axon is swollen and contains eg
numerous synaptic vesicles, which are each packed with
chemicals called neurotransmitters. When action poten- FIGURE 54.13

action of a few of the important neuro-
transmitter chemicals.

The presynaptic axon is separated
from the postsynaptic cell by a
narrow synaptic cleft.
Neurotransmitters diffuse across it
to transmit a nerve impulse.
