Neurotransmitters and Their
Functions

Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter chemical to be
discovered and is widely used in the nervous system. Many
other neurotransmitter chemicals have been shown to play
important roles, however, and ongoing research continues
to produce new information about neurotransmitter func-
tion.

Acetylcholine

Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter that crosses
the synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber.
This synapse is called a mewromuscular junction (figure
54.15). Acetylcholine binds to its receptor proteins in the
postsynaptic membrane and thereby causes ion channels
within these proteins to open (figure 54.16). The gates to
these ion channels are said to be chemically gated because
they open in response to ACh, rather than in response to
depolarization. The opening of the chemically regulated
channels permits Na* to diffuse into the postsynaptic cell
and K* to diffuse out. Although both ions move at the same
time, the inward diffusion of Na* occurs at a faster rate and
has the predominant effect. As a result, that site on the

‘The binding of ACh to its receptor opens ion channels. The chemically regulated gates to these channels open when the

neurotransmitter ACh binds to the receptor.
