Anchoring proteins. Spectrin extends as a
mesh anchored to the cytoplasmic side of a
red blood cell plasma membrane. The

spectrin protein is represented as a twisted Glycophorin

dimer, attached to the membrane by special Ankyrin

proteins such as junctional complexes and Cytoskeletal
ankyrin; glycophorins can also be involved in Linker , proteins
attachments. This cytoskeletal protein Protein dunetional
