The Dominant Forebrain

Starting with the amphibians and continuing more promi-
nently in the reptiles, processing of sensory information is
increasingly centered in the forebrain. This pattern was the
dominant evolutionary trend in the further development of
the vertebrate brain (figure 54.25).

The forebrain in reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mam-
mals is composed of two elements that have distinct func-
tions. The diencephalon (Greek dia, “between”) consists of
the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus is an inte-
grating and relay center between incoming sensory infor-

mation and the cerebrum. The hypothalamus participates
in basic drives and emotions and controls the secretions of
the pituitary gland. The telencephalon, or “end brain”
(Greek telos, “end”), is located at the front of the forebrain
and is devoted largely to associative activity. In mammals,
the telencephalon is called the cerebrum.

The evolution of the vertebrate brain involved changes in the relative sizes of different brain regions. In sharks and other fishes,
the hindbrain is predominant, and the rest of the brain serves primarily to process sensory information. In amphibians and reptiles, the
forebrain is far larger, and it contains a larger cerebrum devoted to associative activity. In birds, which evolved from reptiles, the cerebrum
is even more pronounced. In mammals, the cerebrum covers the optic tectum and is the largest portion of the brain. The dominance of the
cerebrum is greatest in humans, in whom it envelops much of the rest of the brain.
