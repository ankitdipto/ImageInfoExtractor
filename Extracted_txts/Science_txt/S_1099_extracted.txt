The Spinal Cord

The spinal cord is a cable of neurons extending from the
brain down through the backbone (figure 54.31). It is en-
closed and protected by the vertebral column and layers of
membranes called meninges, which also cover the brain. In-
side the spinal cord there are two zones. The inner zone,
called gray matter, consists of interneurons and the cell
bodies of motor neurons. The outer zone, called white
matter, contains the axons and dendrites of nerve cells.
Messages from the body and the brain run up and down the
spinal cord, an “information highway.”

In addition to relaying messages, the spinal cord also
functions in reflexes, the sudden, involuntary movement of
muscles. A reflex produces a rapid motor response to a
stimulus because the sensory neuron passes its information
to a motor neuron in the spinal cord, without higher level
processing. One of the most frequently used reflexes in
your body is blinking, a reflex that protects your eyes. If
anything, such as an insect or a cloud of dust, approaches
your eye, the eyelid blinks before you realize what has hap-
pened. The reflex occurs before the cerebrum is aware the
eye is in danger.

A view down the human spinal cord. Pairs of spinal nerves can
be seen extending from the spinal cord. It is along these nerves, as
well as the cranial nerves that arise from the brain, that the central
nervous system communicates with the rest of the body.
