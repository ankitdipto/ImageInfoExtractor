The Autonomic Nervous System

The autonomic nervous system is composed of the sympa-
thetic and parasympathetic divisions and the medulla ob-
longata of the hindbrain, which coordinates this system.
Though they differ, the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions share several features. In both, the efferent motor
pathway involves two neurons: the first has its cell body in
the CNS and sends an axon to an autonomic ganglion,
while the second has its cell body in the autonomic gan-
glion and sends its axon to synapse with a smooth muscle,
cardiac muscle, or gland cell (figure 54.35). The first neu-
ron is called a preganglionic neuron, and it always releases
ACh at its synapse. The second neuron is a postganglionic
neuron; those in the parasympathetic division release ACh,
while those in the sympathetic division release norepineph-
rine.

In the sympathetic division, the preganglionic neurons
originate in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal
cord (figure 54.36). Most of the axons from these neurons
synapse in two parallel chains of ganglia immediately out-
side the spinal cord. These structures are usually called
the sympathetic chain of ganglia. The sympathetic chain
contains the cell bodies of postganglionic neurons, and it
is the axons from these neurons that innervate the differ-
ent visceral organs. There are some exceptions to this
general pattern, however. Most importantly, the axons of
some preganglionic sympathetic neurons pass through the

An autonomic reflex. There are two motor neurons in the
efferent pathway. The first, or preganglionic neuron, exits the
CNS and synapses at an autonomic ganglion. The second, or
postganglionic neuron, exits the ganglion and regulates the
visceral effectors (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands).
