sympathetic chain without synapsing and,
instead, terminate within the adrenal
gland. The adrenal gland consists of an
outer part, or cortex, and an inner part, or
medulla. The adrenal medulla receives
sympathetic nerve innervation and se-
cretes the hormone epinephrine (adrena-
line) in response.

When the sympathetic division be-
comes activated, epinephrine is released
into the blood as a hormonal secretion,
and norepinephrine is released at the
synapses of the postganglionic neurons.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine act to
prepare the body for fight or flight (fig-
ure 54.37). The heart beats faster and
stronger, blood glucose concentration
increases, blood flow is diverted to the
muscles and heart, and the bronchioles
dilate (table 54.5).

These responses are antagonized by the
parasympathetic division. Preganglionic

parasympathetic neurons originate in the brain and sacral re-
gions of the spinal cord. Because of this origin, there cannot
be a chain of parasympathetic ganglia analogous to the sym-
pathetic chain. Instead, the preganglionic axons, many of
which travel in the vagus (the tenth cranial) nerve, terminate

in ganglia located near or even within the internal organs.
The postganglionic neurons then regulate the internal or-
gans by releasing ACh at their synapses. Parasympathetic
nerve effects include a slowing of the heart, increased secre-
tions and activities of digestive organs, and so on.
