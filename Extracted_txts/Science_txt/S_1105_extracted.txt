54.1 The nervous system consists of neurons and supporting cells.

 

¢ The nervous system is subdivided into the central
nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system
(PNS).

1. What are the differences and
similarities among the three
types of neurons?

* Nervous system
divisions

* Nervous system cells I

* Nervous system cells II

54.2 Nerve impulses are produced on the axon membrane.

 

¢ The resting axon has a membrane potential of -70
mV; the magnitude of this voltage is produced
primarily by the distribution of K*.

¢ A depolarization stimulus opens voltage-regulated
Na* channels and then K* channels, producing first
the upward phase and then the repolarization phase
of the action potential.

* Action potentials are all or none and are conducted
without decrease in amplitude because each action
potential serves as the stimulus for the production of
the next action potential along the axon.

2. Which cation is most
concentrated in the cytoplasm of
acell, and which is most
concentrated in the extracellular
fluid? How are these
concentration differences

* Membrane potential
* Action potential

* Activities:
Action potential 1

‘ &

maintained? Sodiut potsium
3. What is a voltage-gated ion pump
channel? Action potential 2

* Action potential 1
* Membrane potential
* Local potential

4, What happens to the size of
an action potential as it is
propagated?

54.3 Neurons form junctions called synapses with other cells.

 

¢ The presynaptic axon releases neurotransmitter
chemicals that diffuse across the synapse and
stimulate the production of either a depolarization or
a hyperpolarization in the postsynaptic membrane.

* Depolarizations and hyperpolarization can summate
in the dendrites and cell bodies of the postsynaptic
neuron, allowing integration of information.

5. Ifa nerve impulse can jump
from node to node along a
myelinated axon, why can’t it
jump from the presynaptic cell

54.4 The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord.

 

© The vertebrate brain is divided into a forebrain,
midbrain, and hindbrain, and these are further
subdivided into other brain regions. The cerebral
cortex has a primary motor area and a primary
somatosensory area, as well as areas devoted to the
analysis of vision and hearing and the integration and
association of information.

¢ The spinal cord carries information to and from the
brain and coordinates many reflex movements.

6. Where are the basal ganglia
located, and what is their
function?

 

7. How are short-term and long-
term memory thought to differ
in terms of their basic
underlying mechanisms?

* Reflex arc

 

54.5 The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory and motor neurons.

 

¢ The sympathetic division is activated during fight-or-
flight responses; the parasympathetic division opposes
the action of the sympathetic division in most
activiti

parasympathetic divisions differ
in the locations of the ganglionic
neurons?
