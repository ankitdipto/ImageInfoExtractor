Structure of the human ear. (a) Sound waves passing through the ear canal produce vibrations of the tympanic membrane, which cause
movement of the (b) middle ear ossicles (the malleus, incus, and stapes) against an inner membrane called the oval window. Vibration of
the oval window sets up pressure waves that (cand d) travel through the fluid in the vestibular and tympanic canals of the cochlea.

Transduction in the Cochlea

As the pressure waves produced by vibrations of the oval
window are transmitted through the cochlea to the round
window, they cause the cochlear duct to vibrate. The bot-
tom of the cochlear duct, called the basilar membrane, is
quite flexible and vibrates in response to these pressure
waves. The surface of the basilar membrane contains sen-
sory hair cells, similar to those of the vestibular apparatus
and lateral line system but lacking a kinocilium. The cilia
from the hair cells project into an overhanging gelatinous
membrane, the tectorial membrane. This sensory apparatus,

consisting of the basilar membrane, hair cells with associ-
ated sensory neurons, and tectorial membrane, is known as
the organ of Corti.

As the basilar membrane vibrates, the cilia of the hair
cells bend in response to the movement of the basilar mem-
brane relative to the tectorial membrane. As in the lateral
line organs and the vestibular apparatus, the bending of
these cilia depolarizes the hair cells. The hair cells, in turn,
stimulate the production of action potentials in sensory
neurons that project to the brain, where they are inter-
preted as sound.
