endocytosis. (a) Cells that oleae

undergo receptor-mediated °

endocytosis have pits coated
with the protein clathrin that
initiate endocytosis when
target molecules bind to
receptor proteins in the
plasma membrane. (b) A Coated vesicle’
coated pit appears in the

plasma membrane of a (@

developing egg cell, covered
with a layer of proteins
(80,000x). When an
appropriate collection of
molecules gathers in the
coated pit, the pit deepens (0)
and seals off (d) to forma
coated vesicle, which carries
the molecules into the cell.

FIGURE 6.19
Exocytosis. (2) Proteins and other molecules are secreted from cells in small packets called vesicles, whose membranes fuse with the
plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the cell surface. (#) A transmission electron micrograph showing exocytosis.

Exocytosis provides a mechanism for secreting many hormones, neuro-

woe . . transmitters, digestive enzymes, and other substances.
The reverse of endocytosis is exocytosis, the discharge of 7 ns zymes,

material from vesicles at the cell surface (figure 6.19). In
plant cells, exocytosis is an important means of exporting Cells import bulk materials by engulfing them with
the materials needed to construct the cell wall through the their plasma membranes in a process called endocytosis;
