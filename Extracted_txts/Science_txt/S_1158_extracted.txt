T cells bind to foreign antigens in conjunction with MHC proteins. The CD4 coreceptor on helper T cells requires that these cells
interact with class-2 MHC (or MHC-II) proteins. The CD8 coreceptor on cytotoxic T cells requires that these cells interact only with

cells bearing class-1 MHC (or MHC-I) proteins.

Macrophages encounter foreign particles in the body,
partially digest the virus particles, and present the foreign
antigens in a complex with the MHC-II proteins on its
membrane. This combination of MHC-II proteins and for-
cign antigens is required for interaction with the receptors
on the surface of helper T cells. At the same time,
macrophages that encounter antigens or antigen-presenting
cells release a protein called interleukin-1 that acts as a
chemical alarm signal (discussed in the next section).
Helper T cells respond to interleukin-1 by simultaneously
initiating two parallel lines of immune system defense: the

cell-mediated response carried out by T cells and the hu-
moral response carried out by B cells.

 

Antigen-presenting cells must present foreign antigens
together with MHC-II proteins in order to activate
helper T cells, which have the CD4 coreceptor.
Cytotoxic T cells use the CD8 coreceptor and must
interact with foreign antigens presented on MHC-I
proteins.
