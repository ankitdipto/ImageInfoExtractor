The sodium-potassium pump. The protein channel known as the sodium-potassium pump transports sodium (Na*) and potassium (K*)
ions across the cell membrane. For every three Na* that are transported out of the cell, two K* are transported into the cell. The sodium-

potassium pump is fueled by ATP.

so they now face the exterior. In this new conformation,
the protein has a low affinity for Na*, and the three
bound Na* dissociate from the protein and diffuse into
the extracellular fluid.

Step 4. The new conformation has a high affinity for
K*, two of which bind to the extracellular side of the

protein as soon as it is free of the Na*.

Step 5. The binding of the K* causes another confor-
mational change in the protein, this time resulting in the
dissociation of the bound phosphate group.

Step 6. Freed of the phosphate group, the protein re-
verts to its original conformation, exposing the two K*
to the cytoplasm. This conformation has a low affinity
for K*, so the two bound K* dissociate from the protein

and diffuse into the interior of the cell. The original
conformation has a high affinity for Na*; when these
ions bind, they initiate another cycle.

Three Na* leave the cell and two K* enter in every
cycle. The changes in protein conformation that occur
during the cycle are rapid, enabling each carrier to
transport as many as 300 Na* per second. The sodium-
potassium pump appears to be ubiquitous in animal cells,
although cells vary widely in the number of pump pro-
teins they contain.

 

Active transport moves a solute across a membrane up
its concentration gradient, using protein carriers driven
by the expenditure of chemical energy.
