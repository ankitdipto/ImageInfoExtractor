The AIDS epidemic in the United States: new cases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 43,678
new AIDS cases were reported in 1998 and 46,137 new cases in 1999, with a total of 733,374 cases and 390,692 deaths in the United
States. Over 1.5 million other individuals are thought to be infected with the HIV virus in the United States, and 14 million worldwide.
The 100,000th AIDS case was reported in August 1989, eight years into the epidemic; the next 100,000 cases took just 26 months; the
third 100,000 cases took barely 19 months (May 1993), and the fourth 100,000 took only 13 months (June 1994). The extraordinarily high
numbers seen in 1992 reflect an expansion of the definition of what constitutes an AIDS case.

come available that acts to inhibit protease, an enzyme
needed for viral assembly. Treatments that include a com-
bination of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease in-
hibitors (p. 672) appear to lower levels of HIV, though they
are very costly. Efforts to develop a vaccine against AIDS
continue, both by splicing portions of the HIV surface pro-
tein gene into vaccinia virus and by attempting to develop a
harmless strain of HIV. These approaches, while promis-
ing, have not yet proved successful and are limited by the

fact that different strains of HIV seem to possess different
surface antigens. Like the influenza virus, HIV engages in
some form of antigen shifting, making it difficult to de-
velop an effective vaccine.

 

AIDS destroys the ability of the immune system to
mount a defense against any infection. HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, induces a state of immune deficiency
by attacking and destroying CD4*T cells.
