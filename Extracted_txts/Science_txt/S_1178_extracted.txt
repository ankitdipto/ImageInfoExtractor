Negative feedback loops keep the body temperature within a normal range. An increase (top) or decrease (bottom) in body
temperature is sensed by the brain. The integrating center in the brain then processes the information and activates effectors, such as

surface blood vessels, sweat glands, and skeletal muscles. When the body temperature returns to normal, negative feedback prevents
further stimulation of the effectors by the integrating center.
