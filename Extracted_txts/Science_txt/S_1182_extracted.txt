of the body, depending on concentration gradients.

Some water and solutes are reabsorbed,
but excess water and solutes are excreted.

 

 

 

FIGURE 58.8

The interaction between intracellular and extracellular compartments of the body and the external environment. Water can be
taken in from the environment or lost to the environment. Exchanges of water and solutes between the extracellular fluids of the body and
the environment occur across transport epithelia, and water and solutes can be filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. Overall, the
amount of water and solutes that enters and leaves the body must be balanced in order to maintain homeostasis.
