Amphibians and Reptiles

The first terrestrial vertebrates were the amphibians, and
the amphibian kidney is identical to that of freshwater fish.
This is not surprising, because amphibians spend a signifi-
cant portion of their time in fresh water, and when on land,
they generally stay in wet places. Amphibians produce a
very dilute urine and compensate for their loss of Na* by
actively transporting Nat across their skin from the sur-
rounding water.

Reptiles, on the other hand, live in diverse habitats.
Those living mainly in fresh water occupy a habitat simi-

lar to that of the freshwater fish and amphibians and
thus have similar kidneys. Marine reptiles, including
some crocodilians, sea turtles, sea snakes, and one lizard,
possess kidneys similar to those of their freshwater rela-
tives but face opposite problems; they tend to lose water
and take in salts. Like marine teleosts (bony fish), they
drink the seawater and excrete an isotonic urine. Marine
teleosts eliminate the excess salt by transport across their
gills, while marine reptiles eliminate excess salt through
salt glands located near the nose or the eye (fig-
ure 58.14).
