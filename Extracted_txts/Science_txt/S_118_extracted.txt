The proton pump. In this general model of energy-driven proton pumping, the transmembrane protein that acts as a proton pump is
driven through a cycle of two conformations: A and B. The cycle A-+B-sA goes only one way, causing protons to be pumped from the
inside to the outside of the membrane. ATP powers the pump.

Table 6.2 Mechanisms for Transport across Cell Membranes

 

Passage through
Process Membrane How It Works Example
PASSIVE PROCESSES
Diffusion Direct Random molecular motion produces net Movement of oxygen into cells
migration of molecules toward region of lower
concentration
Facilitated diffusion Protein carrier Molecule binds to carrier protein in membrane Movement of glucose into cells
and is transported across; net movement is
toward region of lower concentration
Osmosis Direct Diffusion of water across differentially Movement of water into cells
permeable membrane placed in a hypotonic solution
ACTIVE PROCESSES
Endocytosis
Phagocytosis Membrane vesicle Particle is engulfed by membrane, which folds Ingestion of bacteria by white
around it and forms a vesicle blood cells
Pinocytosis Membrane vesicle Fluid droplets are engulfed by membrane, “Nursing” of human egg cells

Endocytosis triggered by a specific receptor

Vesicles fuse with plasma membrane and eject

Carrier expends energy to export Na* against
a concentration gradient

Carrier expends energy to export protons
against a concentration gradient
