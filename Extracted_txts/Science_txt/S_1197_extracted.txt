58.1 The regulatory systems of the body maintain homeostasis.

* Negative feedback loops maintain nearly constant
extracellular conditions in the internal environment
of the body, a condition called homeostasis.

* Antagonistic effectors afford an even finer degree of
control.

1, What is homeostasis? What
is a negative feedback loop? Give
an example of how homeostasis
is maintained by a negative
feedback loop.

58.2 The extracellular fluid concentration is constant in most vertebrates.

* Osmoregulation

@

 

* Osmoconformers maintain a tissue fluid osmolality
equal to that of their environment, whereas
osmoregulators maintain a constant blood osmolality
that is different from that of their environment.

¢ Insects eliminate water by secreting K* into
Malpighian tubules and the water follows the K* by
osmosis.

¢ The kidneys of most vertebrates eliminate water by
filtering blood into nephron tubules.

¢ Freshwater bony fish are hypertonic to their
environment, and saltwater bony fish are hypotonic
to their environment; these conditions place different
demands upon their kidneys and other regulatory
systems.

¢ Birds and mammals are the only vertebrates that have
loops of Henle and thus are capable of producing a
hypertonic urine.

2. What is the difference
between an osmoconformer and
an osmoregulator? What are
examples of each?

3. How does the body fluid
osmolality of a freshwater
vertebrate compare with that of
its environment? Does water
tend to enter or exit its body?
What must it do to maintain
proper body water levels?

4, In what type of animal are
Malpighian tubules found? By
what mechanism is fluid caused
to flow into these tubules? How
is this fluid further modified
before it is excreted?

58.3 The functions of the vertebrate kidney are performed by nephrons.

* Body fluid distribution
* Water balance

@

 

*¢ The primary function of the kidneys is homeostasis of
blood volume, pressure, and composition, including
the concentration of particular solutes in the blood

and the blood pH.
* Bony fish remove the amine portions of amino acids
and excrete them as ammonia across the gills.

¢ Elasmobranchs, adult amphibians, and mammals
produce and excrete urea, which is quite soluble but
much less toxic than ammonia.

* Insects, reptiles, and birds produce uric acid from the
amino groups in amino acids; this precipitates, so that
little water is required for its excretion.

58.4 The kidney is regulated by hormones.

5. What drives the movement of
fluid from the blood to the
inside of the nephron tubule at
Bowman’s capsule?

6. In what portion of the

nephron is most of the NaCl and
water reabsorbed from the
filtrate?

7. What causes water
reabsorption from the collecting
duct? How is this influenced by
antidiuretic hormone?

and lobe
Nephron anatomy

 

* Kidney function

 

¢ Antidiuretic hormone is secreted by the posterior
pituitary gland in response to an increase in blood
osmolality, and acts to increase the number of water
channels in the walls of the collecting ducts.

8. What effects does aldosterone
have on kidney function? How is
the secretion of aldosterone
stimulated?

* Kidney function
