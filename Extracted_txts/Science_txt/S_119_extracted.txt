* Every cell is encased within a fluid bilayer sheet of
phospholipid molecules called the plasma membrane.

1. How would increasing the
number of phospholipids with
double bonds between carbon
atoms in their tails affect the
fluidity of a membrane?

6.2 Proteins embedded within the plasma membrane determine its character.

Membrane Structure

 

¢ Proteins that are embedded within the plasma
membrane have their hydrophobic regions exposed to
the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer, and their
hydrophilic regions exposed to the cytoplasm or the
extracellular fluid.

¢ Membrane proteins can transport materials into or
out of the cell, they can mark the identity of the cell,
or they can receive extracellular information.

2. Describe the two basic types
of structures that are
characteristic of proteins that
span membranes.

6.3 Passive transport across membranes moves down the concentration gradient.

¢ Diffusion is the kinetic movement of molecules or
ions from an area of high concentration to an area of
low concentration.

* Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Because all
organisms are composed of mostly water, maintaining
osmotic balance is essential to life.

6.4 Bulk transport utilizes endocytosis.

3. Ifa cell’s cytoplasm were
hyperosmotic to the extracellular
fluid, how would the
concentration of solutes in the
cytoplasm compare with that in
the extracellular fluid?

‘Membrane Transport

 

¢ Materials or volumes of fluid that are too large to
pass directly through the cell membrane can move
into or out of cells through endocytosis or exocytosis,
respectively.

¢ In these processes, the cell expends energy to change
the shape of its plasma membrane, allowing the cell
to engulf materials into a temporary vesicle
(endocytosis), or eject materials by fusing a filled
vesicle with the plasma membrane (exocytosis).

4. How do phagocytosis and
pinocytosis differ?

5. Describe the mechanism of
receptor-mediated endocytosis.

6.5 Active transport across membranes is powered by energy from ATP.

* Cells use active transport to move substances across
the plasma membrane against their concentration
gradients, either accumulating them within the cell or
extruding them from the cell. Active transport
requires energy from ATP, either directly or
indirectly.

6. In what two ways does
facilitated diffusion differ from
simple diffusion across a
membrane?

7. How does active transport
differ from facilitated diffusion?
How is it similar to facilitated
diffusion?
