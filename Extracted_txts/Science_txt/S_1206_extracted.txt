The testis and spermatogenesis. Inside the testis, the seminiferous tubules are the sites of spermatogenesis. Germinal cells in the
seminiferous tubules give rise to spermatozoa by meiosis. Sertoli cells are nongerminal cells within the walls of the seminiferous tubules.
They assist spermatogenesis in several ways, such as helping to convert spermatids into spermatozoa. A primary spermatocyte is diploid. At
the end of the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes have separated, and two haploid secondary spermatocytes form. The
second meiotic division separates the sister chromatids and results in the formation of four haploid spermatids.
