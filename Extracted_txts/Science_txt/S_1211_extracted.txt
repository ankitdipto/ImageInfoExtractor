The meiotic events
of oogenesis in
humans. A primary
oocyte is diploid. At
the completion of the
first meiotic division,
one division product
is eliminated as a
polar body, while the

other, the secondary eee i
oocyte, is released | F
during ovulation. The First polar body |=) |

secondary oocyte does
not complete the
second meiotic
division until after
fertilization; that
division yields a
second polar body and
a single haploid egg,
or ovum. Fusion of
the haploid egg with a
haploid sperm during
fertilization produces
a diploid zygote.

MEIOSIS II

 

Ovulation.

The increasing level of estradiol in the
blood during the follicular phase stimu-
lates the anterior pituitary gland to se-
crete LH about midcycle. This sudden
secretion of LH causes the fully devel-
oped Graafian follicle to burst in the
process of ovulation, releasing its sec-
ondary oocyte. The released oocyte en-
ters the abdominal cavity near the fim-
briae, the feathery projections
surrounding the opening to the fallopian
tube. The ciliated epithelial cells lining
the fallopian tube propel the oocyte
through the fallopian tube toward the
uterus. If it is not fertilized, the oocyte
will disintegrate within a day following
ovulation. If it is fertilized, the stimulus
of fertilization allows it to complete the
second meiotic division, forming a fully
mature ovum and a second polar body.
Fusion of the two nuclei from the ovam
and the sperm produces a diploid zygote
(figure 59.19). Fertilization normally oc-
curs in the upper one-third of the fallop-
ian tube, and in a human the zygote
takes approximately three days to reach
the uterus, then another two to three
days to implant in the endometrium (fig-
ure 59.20).

FIGURE 59.20

The journey of an egg. Produced within a follicle and released at ovulation, an egg is
swept into a fallopian tube and carried along by waves of ciliary motion in the tube walls.
Sperm journeying upward from the vagina fertilize the egg within the fallopian tube. The
resulting zygote undergoes several mitotic divisions while still in the tube, so that by the
time it enters the uterus, it is a hollow sphere of cells called a blastocyst. The blastocyst
implants within the wall of the uterus, where it continues its development. (The egg and its
subsequent stages have been enlarged for clarification.)
