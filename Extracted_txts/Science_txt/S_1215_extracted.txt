Failure
Device Action Rate*
Oral Hormones (progesterone 15,
contraceptive _ analogue alone or in depending
combination with other on type
hormones) primarily prevent
ovulation
Condom Thin sheath for penis that 3-15
collects semen; “female
condoms” sheath vaginal walls
Diaphragm Soft rubber cup covers 425
entrance to uterus, prevents
sperm from reaching egg,
holds spermicide
Intrauterine Small plastic or metal device 1-5
device (UD) placed in the uterus;
prevents implantation;
some contain copper,
others release hormones
Cervical cap Miniature diaphragm covers. Probably
cervix closely, prevents sperm similar to
from reaching egg, holds that of
spermicide diaphragm
Foams, creams, Chemical spermicides 10-25
jellies, vaginal _inserted in vagina before
suppositories intercourse that prevent
sperm from entering uterus
Implant Capsules surgically implanted .03
(levonorgestrel; under skin slowly release
Norplant) hormone that blocks
ovulation
Injectable Injection every 3 months of 1
contraceptive a hormone that is slowly
(medroxy- released and prevents
progesterone; —_ ovulation

Advantages

Convenient; highly effective;
provides significant
noncontraceptive health
benefits, such as protection
against ovarian and endometrial
cancers

Easy to use; effective;
inexpensive; protects against
some sexually transmitted
diseases

No dangerous side effects;
reliable if used properly;
provides some protection
against sexually transmitted
diseases and cervical cancer

Convenient; highly effective;
infrequent replacement

No dangerous side effects; fairly
effective; can remain in place
longer than diaphragm

Can be used by anyone who

is not allergic; protect against
some sexually transmitted
diseases; no known side effects

Very safe, convenient, and
effective; very long-lasting

(5 years); may have
nonreproductive health benefits
like those of oral contraceptives

Convenient and highly
effective; no serious side effects
other than occasional heavy
menstrual bleeding

Disadvantages

Must be taken regularly;
possible minor side effects which
new formulations have

reduced; not for women with
cardiovascular risks (mostly
smokers over age 35)

Requires male cooperation; may
diminish spontaneity; may
deteriorate on the shelf

Requires careful fitting; some
inconvenience associated with
insertion and removal; may be
dislodged during intercourse

Can cause excess menstrual
bleeding and pain; risk of
perforation, infection, expulsion,
pelvic inflammatory disease, and
infertility; not recommended for
those who eventually intend to
conceive or are not monogamous;
dangerous in pregnancy
Problems with fitting and
insertion; comes in limited
number of sizes

Relatively unreliable; sometimes
messy; must be used 5—10 minutes
before each act of intercourse

Irregular or absent periods;
minor surgical procedure needed
for insertion and removal; some
scarring may occur

Animal studies suggest it may
cause cancer, though new studies
in humans are mostly encouraging;
occasional heavy menstrual
bleeding

estrogens. As described earlier, progesterone and estradiol
act by negative feedback to inhibit the secretion of FSH
and LH during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle,
thereby preventing follicle development and ovulation.
They also cause a buildup of the endometrium. The hor-
mones in birth control pills have the same effects. Because
the pills block ovulation, no ovum is available to be fertil-
ized. A woman generally takes the hormone-containing

pills for three weeks; during the fourth week, she takes pills
without hormones (placebos), allowing the levels of those
hormones in her blood to fall, which causes menstruation.
Oral contraceptives provide a very effective means of birth
control, with a failure rate of only 1 to 5%. Ina variation of
the oral contraceptive, hormone-containing capsules are
implanted beneath the skin. These implanted capsules have
failure rates below 1%.
