Organogenesis

 

‘The haploid male and female gametes fuse to forma diploid
zygote.

The zygote rapidly divides into many cells, with no overall
increase in size. These divisions affect future development, since
different cells receive different portions of the egg cytoplasm and,
hence, different regulatory signals.

The cells of the embryo move, forming three primary cell layers:
ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.

In all chordates, the first organ to form is the notochord; second
is the dorsal nerve cord.

During neurulation, the neural crest is produced as the neural
tube is formed. The neural crest gives rise to several uniquely
vertebrate structures.

Cells from the three primary layers combine in various ways to
produce the organs of the body.
