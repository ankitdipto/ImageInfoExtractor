tional steps in the developmental journey. This hypothe-
sis, proposed in the nineteenth century by Ernst Haeckel,
is referred to as the “biogenic law.” It is usually stated as
an aphorism: ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny; that is, em-
bryological development (ontogeny) involves the same
progression of changes that have occurred during evolu-
tion (phylogeny). However, the biogenic law is not liter-
ally true when stated in this way because embryonic stages
are not reflections of adult ancestors. Instead, the embry-
onic stages of a particular vertebrate often reflect the em-
bryonic stages of that vertebrate’s ancestors. Thus, the

pharyngeal slits of a mammalian embryo are not like the
gill slits its ancestors had when they were adults. Rather,
they are like the pharyngeal slits its ancestors had when

they were embryos.

Vertebrates seem to have evolved largely by the
addition of new instructions to the developmental
program. Development of a mammal thus proceeds
through a series of stages, and the earlier stages are
unchanged from those that occur in the development of
more primitive vertebrates.
