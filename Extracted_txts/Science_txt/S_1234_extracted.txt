FIGURE 60.20

The extraembryonic membranes of a mammalian embryo. (a) After the embryo implants into the motherâ€™s endometrium (6-7 days
after fertilization), the trophoblast becomes the chorion, and the yolk sac and amnion are produced. (}) The chorion develops extensions,
called villi, that interdigitate with surrounding endometrial tissue. The embryo is encased within an amniotic sac.
