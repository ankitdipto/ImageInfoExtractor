| 60.5 Human development is divided into trimesters.

First Trimester

The development of the human embryo shows its evolu-
tionary origins. Without an evolutionary perspective, we
would be unable to account for the fact that human devel-
opment proceeds in much the same way as development in
a bird. In both animals, the embryo develops from a flat-
tened collection of cells—the blastodise in birds or the
inner cell mass in humans. While the blastodisc of a bird is
flattened because it is pressed against a mass of yolk, the
inner cell mass of a human is flat despite the absence of a
yolk mass. In humans as well as in birds, a primitive streak

forms and gives rise to the three primary germ layers.
Human development, from fertilization to birth, takes an
average of 266 days. This time is commonly divided into
three periods, called trimesters.

The First Month

About 30 hours after fertilization, the zygote undergoes its
first cleavage; the second cleavage occurs about 30 hours
after that. By the time the embryo reaches the uterus (6-7
days after fertilization), it is a blastula, which in mammals is
referred to as a blastocyst. As we mentioned earlier, the

Structure of the placenta. The placenta contains a fetal component, the chorionic frondosum, and a maternal component, the decidua
basalis. Deoxygenated fetal blood from the umbilical arteries (shown in blue) enters the placenta, where it picks up oxygen and nutrients
from the mother’s blood. Oxygenated fetal blood returns in the umbilical vein (shown in red) to the fetus, where it picks up oxygen and

nutrients from the mother’s blood.
