The Third Month

The nervous system and sense organs develop during the
third month, and the arms and legs start to move (figure
60.23c). The embryo begins to show facial expressions and
carries out primitive reflexes such as the startle reflex and
sucking. The eighth week marks the transition from em-
bryo to fetus. At this time, all of the major organs of the
body have been established. What remains of development
is essentially growth.

At around 10 weeks, the secretion of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) by the placenta declines, and the
corpus luteum regresses as a result. However, menstrua-
tion does not occur because the placenta itself secretes
estradiol and progesterone (figure 60.24). In fact, the
amounts of these two hormones secreted by the placenta
far exceed the amounts that are ever secreted by the
ovaries. The high levels of estradiol and progesterone in
the blood during pregnancy continue to inhibit the re-
lease of FSH and LH, thereby preventing ovulation.
They also help maintain the uterus and eventually pre-
pare it for labor and delivery, and they stimulate the de-
velopment of the mammary glands in preparation for lac-
tation after delivery.

Hormonal secretion by the placenta. The placenta secretes
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for 10 weeks. Thereafter, it
secretes increasing amounts of estradiol and progesterone.

 

The embryo implants into the endometrium,
differentiates the germ layers, forms the
extraembryonic membranes, and undergoes
organogenesis during the first month and
morphogenesis during the second month.
