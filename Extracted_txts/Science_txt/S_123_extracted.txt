7.2 Proteins in the cell and on its surface receive

Intracellular Receptors

All cell signaling pathways share certain common elements,
including a chemical signal that passes from one cell to an-
other and a receptor that receives the signal in or on the
target cell. We've looked at the sorts of signals that pass
from one cell to another. Now let’s consider the nature of
the receptors that receive the signals. Table 7.1 summarizes
the types of receptors we will discuss in this chapter.

Many cell signals are lipid-soluble or very small mole-
cules that can readily pass across the plasma membrane of
the target cell and into the cell, where they interact with a
receptor. Some bind to protein receptors located in the cy-
toplasm; others pass across the nuclear membrane as well
and bind to receptors within the nucleus. These intracel-
lular receptors (figure 7.4) may trigger a variety of re-
sponses in the cell, depending on the receptor.

These receptors are located within the cell and function in the
reception of signals such as steroid hormones, vitamin D, and

thyroid hormone.

Molecular “gates” triggered

Binds signal extracellularly,
catalyzes response intracellularly

Binding of signal to receptor causes
GTP to bind a G protein; G protein,
with attached GTP, detaches to
deliver the signal inside the cell
