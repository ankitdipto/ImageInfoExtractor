¢ Fertilization is the union of an egg and a sperm to
form a zygote. It is accomplished externally in most
fish and amphibians, and internally in all other
vertebrates.

¢ The three stages of fertilization are (1) penetration,
(2) activation, and (3) fusion.

60.2 Cell cleavage and the formation of a blastula set the stage for later development.

1. What are the three stages of
fertilization, and what happens
during each stage?

* Fertilization

 

* Cleavage is the rapid division of the newly formed
zygote into a mass of cells, without any increase in
overall size.

* The cleavages produce a hollow ball of cells, called
the blastula.

2. What is the difference

between holoblastic cleavage and

meroblastic cleavage? What is
responsible for an embryo
undergoing one or the other
type of cleavage?

60.3 Gastrulation forms the three germ layers of the embryo.

 

* Early development
* Preembryonic
development

 

* During gastrulation, cells in the blastula change their
relative positions, forming the three primary cell
layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.

¢ In eggs with moderate or large amounts of yolk, cells
involute down and around the yolk, through a
blastopore or primitive streak to form the three germ
layers.

3. What is an archenteron, and

during what developmental stage

does it form? What is the future
fate of this opening in
vertebrates?

4. How is gastrulation in
amphibians different from that
in lancelets?

 

* Cell differentation

60.4 Body architecture is determined during the next stages of embryonic development.

 

¢ Neurulation involves the formation of a structure
found only in chordates, the notochord and dorsal
hollow nerve cord.

¢ The formation of the neural crest is the first
developmental event unique to vertebrates. Most of
the distinctive structures associated with vertebrates
are derived from the neural crest.

60.5 Human development is divided into trimesters.

5. What structure unique to
chordates forms during
neurulation?

6. What are the functions of

the amnion, chorion, and
allantois in birds and mammals?

 

* Art Activity:
Human extra-
embryonic membranes

+ Embryonic and fetal
development

 

* Most of the critical events in human development
occur in the first month of pregnancy. Cleavage
occurs during the first week, gastrulation during the
second week, neurulation during the third week, and
organogenesis during the fourth week.

* The second and third months of human development
are devoted to morphogenesis and to the elaboration
of the nervous system and sensory organs.

¢ During the last six months before birth, the human
fetus grows considerably, and the brain produces
large numbers of neurons and establishes major nerve
tracts.

7. How does the placenta
prevent menstruation during the
first two months of pregnancy?

8. At what time during human
pregnancy does organogenesis
occur?

9. Is neurological growth
complete at birth?

10. What hormone stimulates
lactation (milk production)?
What hormone stimulates milk
ejection from the breast?
