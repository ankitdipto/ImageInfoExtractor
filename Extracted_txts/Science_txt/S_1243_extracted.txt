trogen, oxygen, fuonne and neon Each has one more proton 19 the
nucleus than the preceding element, and the extra electrons go into a
second orbit (Figure 1 2) This orbit then full Inthe next eight elements
(uth atomic numbers 11 to 18), the additional electrons enter athid shell

“The negatwely charged electrons are attracted 10 the postive nucleus by
electrostatic ateaction An electron near the nucleus is strongly attracted
by the nucleus and has a low potential energy An electron distant from the
nucleus i less firmly held and has a high potential energy

ATOMIC SPECTRA OF HYDROGEN AND THE BOHR THEORY

When atoms are heated or subjected to an electne discharge they absorb
energy, whic subsequently emitted a radiation For example, if sodium
