Figure 1.3 Spectrum of hydrogen in the visible region (Balmer series.)

where ¢ is the velocity of light (2.9979 x 10®ms™'). In spectroscopy,
frequencies are generally expressed as wave numbers ¥, where ¥ =
iam! .

In 1885 Balmer showed that the wave number ¥ of any line in the visible
spectrum of atomic hydrogen could be given by the simple empirical

formula:
=_ 1 3)
v= a rn,

where R is the Rydberg constant and 7 has the values 3, 4, 5..., thus
giving a series of lines.

The lines observed in the visible region are called the Balmer series, but
several other series of lines may be observed in different regions of the
spectrum (Table 1.1).

Similar equations were found to hold for the lines in the other series in
the hydrogen spectrum.

Lyman ¥ r(4-4) n= 2,3,4,5...

Balmer v=R(4-4) n=3,4,5,6...
