In the early years of this century, attempts were made to obtain a
physical picture of the atom from this and other evidence ‘Thomson had
shown in 1896 that the application of a high electrical potential across a gas
‘gave electrons, suggesting that these were present in atoms Rutherford
suggested from alpha particle scattering experiments that an atom con
sisted of a heavy positively charged nucleus with a sufficient number of
electrons round xt to make the atom electrically neutral In 1913, Niels
Bohr combined these ideas and suggested that the atonuc nucleus was
surrounded by electrons moving in orbits like planets round the sun He
‘was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics im 1922 for his work on the
structure of the atom Several problems anse with this concept

 

1 The electrons might be expected to slow dawn gradually

2. Why should electrons move in an orbit round the nucleus?

3 Since the nucleus and electrons have opposite charges, they should
attract each other Thus one would expect the electrons to spiral
anwards until eventually they cotlide with the nucleus

‘To explain these problems Bohr postulated

1 An electron did not rachate energy if it stayed in one orbit, and there-
fore did not stow down

2 When an electron moved from one orbit to another it either radiated
‘or absorbed energy If it moved towards the nucleus energy was
cadiated and Cx raved away Soom the nucleus energy was aheorbed

3. Foranelectron to remain ints orbit the electrostatic attraction between
‘the electron and the nucleus which tends to pull the electron towards
the nucleus must be equal to the centrifugal force which tends to throw
the electron out of us orbit For an electton of mass m, moving with 3
