According to Planck’s quantum theory, energy is not continuous but is
discrete. This means that energy occurs in ‘packets’ called quanta, of
magnitude h/2x, where h is Planck’s constant. The energy of an electron in
an orbit, that is its angular momentum mvr, must be equal to a whole
number n of quanta.

For hydrogen the charge on the nucleus Z = 1, and if

n = 1 this gives a value r = 17 x 0.0529nm

n=2 r= 2? x 0.0529nm

n=3 r= 3? x 0.0529nm
This gives a picture of the hydrogen atom where an electron moves in
Circular orbits of radius proportional to 17, 27, 3... The atom will only
radiate energy when the electron jumps from one orbit to another. The
kinetic energy of an electron is —}mv?. Rearranging equation (1.1)
