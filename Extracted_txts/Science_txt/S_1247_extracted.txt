REFINEMENTS TO THE BOHR THEORY

Ithas been assumed thatthe nucleus remains stavonary except for rotating
‘onits own ans This would be true ifthe mass of the nucleus were ifiité,
bout the ratio of the mass of an electron to the mass ofthe hydrogen nucleus

nucleus explains why different isotopes of an element produce lines 1 the
spectrum at slighty different wavenumbers

The orbits are someumes denoted by the letters K,L,M,N counting
‘outwards from the nucleus, and they are also numbered 1,2,3,4 This
