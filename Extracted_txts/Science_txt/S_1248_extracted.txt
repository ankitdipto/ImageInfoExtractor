n. It is therefore possible to define which circular orbit is under
consideration by specifying the principal quantum number.

When an electron moves from one orbit to another it should give a single
sharp line in the Spectrum, corresponding precisely to the energy dif-

ference between the initial and final orbits. If the hydrogen spectrum is .

observed with a high resolution spectrometer it is found that some of the
lines reveal ‘fine structure’. This means that a line is really composed of
several lines close together. Sommerfeld explained this splitting of lines by

space round the nucleus, For the orbit closest to the nucleus, the principal
quantum number n = 1, and there is a circular orbit, For the next orbit, the
principal quantum number n = 2, and both circular and elliptical orbits are
Possible. To define an elliptical orbit, a second quantum number k is

needed, The shape of the ellipse is defined by the ratio of the lengths of the
major and minor axes, Thus ,

t is called the azimuthal or subsidiary quantum number, and may have
values from 1,2. ..n. Thus forn = 2, n/k may have the values 2/2 (circular
