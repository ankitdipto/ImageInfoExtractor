‘This explained why some of the spectral nes are split into two, three,
fout or more lines. In addition some spectral fines are spit sil further into
{wo lines (a doublet). This ss explained by assuming that an electron spins
fn its axis n either a clockwise or an anticlockwise direction. Energy is
quantized, and the value of the spin angular momentum was first con-
sidered to be m,-h/2R. where mis the spin quantum number with values

Ys(s + I)-h?2x, where s is either the spin quantum number or the
resultant of several spins.)

Zeeman showed that if atoms were placed in a strong magnetic field
Additional mes appeared on the spectrum. This is because elliptical orbits
‘can only take up certain orientations with respect to the external feld,

ther than precessing freely. Each of these orientations is associated
with @ fourth quantum number m which can have values of &

‘Thus in order f0 explain the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, four
‘quantum numbers are needed, 25 shown in Table 1.2. The spectra of othet
atoms may be explained in a similar manner.
