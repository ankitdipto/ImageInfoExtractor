Substituting for v? in equation (1.5) gives the well-known form of
the Schrédinger equation

Acceptable solutions to the wave equation, that is solutions which are
physically possible, must have certain properties:

1. ap must be continuous.

2. wp must be finite.

3. p must be single valued.

4. The probability of finding the electron over all the space from
Plus infinity to minus infinity must be equal to one.

The probability of finding an electron at a point x, y, z is p*, so
+e
f Wardyaz =1

Several wave functions called Yi, Yo, Ys... will satisfy these conditions
to the wave equation, and each of these has a corresponding energy Ey, E>,
E3.... Each of these wave functions 1p, pz, etc. is called an orbital, by
analogy with the orbits in the Bohr theory. In a hydrogen atom, the single
electron normally occupies the lowest of the energy levels Ey. This is called
the ground state. The corresponding wave function , describes the
orbital, that is the volume in space where there is a high Probability of
finding the electron.

For a given type of atom, there are a number of solutions to the wave
equation which are acceptable, and each orbital may be described uniquely
by a set of three quantum numbers, n, / and m. (These are the same
quantum numbers ~ principal, subsidiary and magnetic — as were used in
the Bohr theory).

The subsidiary quantum number / describes the shape of the orbital
occupied by the electron. | may have values 0, 1, 2 or 3. When [ = 0, the
orbital is spherical and is called an s orbital; when J = 1, the orbital is
dumb-bell shaped and is called a P orbital; when / = 2, the orbital is double
dumb-bell shaped and is called a d orbital; and when ] =

Shows that the orbitals fall into groups.
