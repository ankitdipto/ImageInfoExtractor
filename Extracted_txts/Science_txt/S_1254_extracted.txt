distance from the nucleus r and also on two directions in space, for
example

w= f(r). f(x). f(y)

This group of orbitals has / = 2, and these are called d orbitals. There are
five solutions corresponding to m = —2, -1, 0, +1 and +2, and these are
all equal in energy. Thus five degenerate d orbitals occur for each of the
values of n = 3, 4,5....

A further set of solutions occurs when | = 3, and these are called f
orbitals, There are seven values of m: —3, -2, -1,0, +1, +2 and +3, and
seven degenerate f orbitals are formed when n = 4, 5,6...

RADIAL AND ANGULAR FUNCTIONS

The Schrédinger equation can be solved completely for the hydrogen
atom, and for related ions which have only one electron such as He* and
Li*. For other atoms only approximate solutions can be obtained. For
most calculations, it is simpler to solve the wave equation if the cartesian
coordinates x, y and z are converted into polar coordinates r, @ and ». The
coordinates of the point A measured from the origin are x, y, and z in
cartesian coordinates, and r, @ and ¢ in polar coordinates. It can be seen
from Figure 1.7 that the two sets of coordinates are related by the
following expressions:

z=rcosé

y=rsin@ sind

x =rsin6@ cosd
The Schrddinger equation is usually written:

822;
Vap + Tr (E- Vyy=0
