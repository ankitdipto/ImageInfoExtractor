These diagrams show that the probability is zero at the nucleus (as
"= 0), and by examining the plots for 1s, 2s and 3s that the most probable
distance increases markedly as the principal quantum number increases,
Furthermore, by comparing the plots for 2s and 2p, or 3s, 3p and 3d it can
be seen that the most probable radius decreases slightly as the subsidiary

quantum number increases. All the 5 orbitals except the first one (1s) have
a shell-like Structure, rather like an onion or a hailstone, consisting of
Concentric layers of electron density. Similarly, all but the first p orbitals
(2p) and the first d orbitals (3d) have a shell structure,

fe angular function A depends only on the direction, and is indepen-
