 

RADIAL AND ANGULAR FUNCTIONS

finding an electron at a given direction 6, } at any distance from the
nucleus to infinity. The angular functions Aare plotted as polar diagrams in
Figure 1.9. It must be emphasized that these polar diagrams do not
represent the total wave function 1p, but only the angular part of the wave
function. (The total wave function is made up from contributions from
both the radial and the angular functions.)

p= R(r).A

Thus the probability of finding an electron simultaneously at a distance r
and in a given direction 6, > is p?.6.9-

Wro.g = R?(r). A7(8,)

Polar diagrams, that is drawings of the the angular part of the wave
function, are commonly used to illustrate the overlap of orbitals giving
bonding between atoms. Polar diagrams are quite good for this purpose, as
they show the signs + and â€” relating to the symmetry of the angular
function. For bonding like signs must overlap. These shapes are slightly
different from the shapes of the total wave function. There are several
points about such diagrams:

1. It is difficult to picture an angular wave function as a mathematical
equation. It is much easier to visualize a boundary surface, that is a solid
shape, which for example contains 90% of the electron density. To
emphasize that y is a continuous function, the boundary surfaces
have been extended up to the nucleus in Figure 1.9. For p orbitals the
electron density is zero at the nucleus, and some texts show a p orbital
as two spheres which do not touch.

2. These drawings show the symmetry for the Is, 2p, 3d orbitals.
However, in the others, 25,35, 4s... , 3p, 4p, 5p... , 4d, 5d... the sign
(symmetry) changes inside the boundary surface of the orbital. This is
readily seen as nodes in the graphs of the radial functions (Figure 1.8).
