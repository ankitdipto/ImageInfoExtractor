Cell Surface Receptors

Most signal molecules are water-soluble, including neuro-
transmitters, peptide hormones, and the many proteins
that multicellular organisms employ as “growth factors”
during development. Water-soluble signals cannot diffuse
through cell membranes. Therefore, to trigger responses
in cells, they must bind to receptor proteins on the sur-
face of the cell. These cell surface receptors (figure 7.6)
convert the extracellular signal to an intracellular one, re-
sponding to the binding of the signal molecule by produc-
ing a change within the cell’s cytoplasm. Most of a cell’s
receptors are cell surface receptors, and almost all of them
belong to one of three receptor superfamilies: chemically
gated ion channels, enzymic receptors, and G-protein-
linked receptors.

Chemically Gated Ion Channels

Chemically gated ion channels are receptor proteins that
ions pass through. The receptor proteins that bind many
neurotransmitters have the same basic structure (figure
7.6a). Each is a “multipass” transmembrane protein, mean-
ing that the chain of amino acids threads back and forth

across the plasma membrane several times. In the center of
the protein is a pore that connects the extracellular fluid
with the cytoplasm. The pore is big enough for ions to pass
through, so the protein functions as an ion channel. The
channel is said to be chemically gated because it opens
when a chemical (the neurotransmitter) binds to it. The
type of ion (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, for ex-
ample) that flows across the membrane when a chemically
gated ion channel opens depends on the specific three-
dimensional structure of the channel.

Enzymic Receptors

Many cell surface receptors either act as enzymes or are di-
rectly linked to enzymes (figure 7.6). When a signal mole-
cule binds to the receptor, it activates the enzyme. In al-
most all cases, these enzymes are protein kinases, enzymes
that add phosphate groups to proteins. Most enzymic re-
ceptors have the same general structure. Each is a single-
pass transmembrane protein (the amino acid chain passes
through the plasma membrane only once); the portion that
binds the signal molecule lies outside the cell, and the por-
tion that carries out the enzyme activity is exposed to the
cytoplasm.

Cell surface receptors. (@) Chemically gated ion channels are multipass transmembrane proteins that form a pore in the cell membrane.
This pore is opened or closed by chemical signals. (4) Enzymic receptors are single-pass transmembrane proteins that bind the signal on
the extracellular surface. A catalytic region on their cytoplasmic portion then initiates enzymatic activity inside the cell. (c) G-protein-
linked receptors bind to the signal outside the cell and to G proteins inside the cell. The G protein then activates an enzyme or ion
channel, mediating the passage of a signal from the cell’s surface to its interior.
