 

(- BUILD-UP OF THE ELEMENTS, HUND’S RULE

 

 

The fourth clectron in beryllium also occupies the 2s level. Boron must
have its fifth electron in the 2p level as the 2s level is full. The sixth electron
in carbon is also in the 2p level. Hund’s rule states that the number of
unpaired electrons in a given energy level is a maximum. Thus in the
ground state the two p electrons in carbon are unpaired. They occupy
separate p orbitals and have parallel spins. Similarly in nitrogen the three p
electrons are unpaired and have parallel spins.

To show the positions of the electrons in an atom, the symbols 1s, 2s, 2p,
etc. are used to denote the main energy level and sub-level. A superscript
indicates the number of electrons in each set of orbitals. Thus for
hydrogen, the 1s orbital contains one electron, and this is shown as 1s‘. For
helium the 1s orbital contains two electrons, denoted 1s”. The electronic
structures of the first few atoms in the periodic table may be written:

H 1s!

He 1s?

Li 1s? 2s!

Be —1s?_2s?

B 1s? 2s? 2p!
Cc 1s? 2s? 2p?
N 4s? 25? 2p
O + 1st 25? 2p8
F 1s? 2s? 2p5

Ne 1s? 2s? - 2p®
Na 1s? 25? 2p 35!

An alternative way of showing the electronic structure of an atom is to
draw boxes for orbitals, and arrows for the electrons.
