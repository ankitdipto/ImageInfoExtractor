SEQUENCE OF ENERGY LEVELS

J important to know the sequence in which the energy levels are filled
Figure } 131s a useful aid From thst can be scen that the order of eg
of energy levels 1s 1s,25, 2p. 35. 3p 45,3d 4p, 5s. 4d, Sp. 65, 4f, 5d, 6Ps
7s, ete

‘After the 1s. 2s, 2p, 35 and 3p levels have been filled at argon, the nest
‘wo electrons go into the ds level This gives the elements potassium and
calcium Once the 4s level is full the 3d level 1s the next lowest n enef¥>
fot the 3p level Thus the 3d starts to fill at scandium The elements (10%
scandium to copper have two electrons inthe 4s fevel and an incomplete 34
Jevel, and al behave in a similar manner chemically Such a series of atoms
1s known as a transition series

A second transition series starts after the Ss orbital has been filed. 3
strontium, because inthe next element, stinum the dd level begins 10 fill
Up A third transition senes starsat Lanthanum where the electeons tat
fil the $d level after the 6d level has been filled with two electrons

‘A further complication arises here because after lanthanum, which has
‘one electron othe Sd level, the Af level begins to fill, pring the elemetts
from cenum to tutetium with from one to 14f electrons These
sometimes called the inner transition elements but are usually known 35
the lanthanides or rare earth metals
