PROBLEMS

The first shell may contain up to 2 electrons, the second shell up to 8,
the third shell up to 18, and the fourth shell up to 32. Explain this
arrangement in terms of quantum numbers.

Give the values of the four quantum numbers for each electron in the
ground state for (a) the oxygen atom, and (b) the scandium atom. (Use
positive values for mm, and m, first.)

. Give the sequence in which the energy levels in an atom are filled with

electrons. Write the electronic configurations for the elements of
atomic number 6, 11, 17 and 25, and from this decide to which group in
the periodic table each element belongs.

Give the name and symbol for each of the atoms which have the
ground state electronic configurations in their outer shells: (a) 2s?,
(b) 35°3p*, (c) 3s°3p%4s?, (d) 3s?3p°3d%ds?, (e) 5825p”, (£) 5s25p°.
