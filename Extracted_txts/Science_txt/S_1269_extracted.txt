ATTAINMENT OF A STABLE CONFIGURATION

How do atoms combine to form motecules and why do atoms form bonds?
A molecule will only be formed if 11s more stable, and has a lower energy,
than the mdwidyal atoms

‘To understand what 1s happening mn terms of clectromse structure, ¢om
sider frst the Group 18 elements These compnse the noble gases, hehum,
zeon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon, which are noteworthy for thet
chemical mertness Atoms of the noble gases do aot marmally react with
any other atoms, and their molecules are monatomic, 1€ contain only one
‘atom The fack of reactiity 18 because the atoms already have 2 fo"
energy, and it eannot be lowered further by forrting compounds. The low
energy of the noble gases 1s assocrated with their having @ complete Out
shell of electrons This 1s often called a noble gas structure, and 118 3
‘exceptionally stable arrangement of electrons

Notmally oly electrons i the outermost shell Of an atom are involsedin
forming bonds, and by forming bonds each atom acquires a stable electon
configuration "The most stable electronic arrangement 1s a noble gis
structure, and many molecules have this arrangement Howevet, les

stable arrangements than this are commonly attamed by transtiot
elements

‘TYPES OF BONDS

Atoms may attain a stable electronic configuration in three different ways

by losing electrons, by gaming electrons, or by sharing electrons
Elements may be di

  

1 Electroposnive elements, whose atoms give up one or more electrons
faxrly readily

2. Electronegative elements, which will accept electrons

3 Elements which have Intle tendency to lose ar gain electrons,

Three diferent types of bond may be formed, depending on the
electropositve or electronegative character of the atoms involved
