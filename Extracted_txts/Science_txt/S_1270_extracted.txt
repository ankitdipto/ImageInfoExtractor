lonic bonding involves the complete transfer of one or more electrons
from one atom to another. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of a pair
of electrons between two atoms, and in metallic bonding the valency
electrons are free to move throughout the whole crystal.

These types of bonds are idealized or extreme representations, and
though one type generally predominates, in most substances the bond type
is somewhere between these extreme forms. For example, lithium chloride
is considered to be an ionic compound, but it is soluble in alcohol, which
Suggests that it also possesses a small amount of covalent character. If the
three extreme bond types are placed at the corners of a triangle, then
compounds with bonds predominantly of one type will be represented as
points near the corners. Compounds with bonds intermediate between two
types will occur along an edge of the triangle, whilst compounds with bonds

showing some characteristics of all three types are shown as points inside
the triangle.
