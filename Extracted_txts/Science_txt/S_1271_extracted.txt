INTRODUCTION TO BONDING

 

 

‘TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE MAIN TYPES OF BONDING

Few bonds are purely tonic covalent or metallic Most are intermediate
between the three main types and show some properties of at least two
‘and sometimes of all three types

Tomebonds

Tonic bonds are formed when electropositive elements react with electro
negative elements

Consider the tonte compound sodium chloride A sodium atom has the
lectrome configuration Is? 2s? 2p" 33! “The first and second shells of
electrons are fll but the thurd shel contams only one efectron. When ths
atom reacts #t wall do so 1n such a way that 1 attains @ stable electron
configuration The noble gases have a stable electron arrangement and the
nearest noble gas to sodium 1s neon whose configuration 1s 1s? 2s? 2p" It
the sodium atom can lose one electron from its outer shell st wall attain this
configuration and in doing so the sodium acquites a net charge of +1 ands
called a sodium son Na” The posiuve charge anses because the nucleus
contains II protons each with a positive charge but there are now only 10
electrons Sodium atoms tend to lose an electron inthis way when they a¢
supplied wath energy and so sodium 1s an electroposiive element

wera, ot Nat + electron

Chlorine atoms have the electronic configuration 1s” 2s” 2p 35” 3p They
are only one electron short of the stable noble gas configuration of argon
As 2s" 2p* 3s" 3p* and when chlorine atoms ceact they gatn an electron
‘Thus chlorine 15 an electronegative element

G+ electron + Ch
al atm shied on

‘Through garming am electron an electrically neutral chlorine atom becomes
‘chloride ton with a net charge of —}

‘When sodium and chlorine react together the outer electron of the
‘sodium atoms 1 transferred to the ehlorine atoms to produce sodium rons
Na* and chloride 1ons Cl_ Electrostatic attraction between the posite
‘and negative sons holds the 1ons together n a crystal fatuice The process's
‘energetically favourble as both sorts of atoms attain the stable noble 08
‘configuration and sodiwm chloride Na*C) 1s formed readily This may be
