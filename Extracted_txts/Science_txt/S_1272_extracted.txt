The formation of calcium chloride CaCl, may be considered in a similar
way. Ca atoms have two electrons in their outer shell. Ca is an
electropositive element, so each Ca atom loses two electrons to two Cl
atoms, forming a calcium ion Ca?* and two chloride ions CI~. Showing the
outer electrons only, this may be represented as follows:

Covalent bonds

When two electronegative atoms react together, both atoms have a
tendency to gain electrons, but neither atom has any tendency to lose
electrons. In such cases the atoms share electrons so as to attain a rioble gas
configuration.

First consider diagrammatically how two chlorine atoms Cl react to form
a chlorine molecule Cl, (only the outer electrons are shown in the
following diagrams):

Each chlorine atom gives a share of one of its electrons to the other atom.
A pair of electrons is shared equally between both atoms, and each atom
now has eight electrons in its outer shell {a stable octet) — the noble gas
Structure of argon. In this electron dot picture (Lewis structure), the
shared electron pair is shown as two dots between the atoms Cl : Cl. In the
Valence bond representation, these dots are replaced by a line, which
Tepresents a bond CI—Cl,

In a similar way a molecule of tetrachloromethane CCl, is made up of
one carbon and four chlorine atoms:

ca
cord-aloa:cra
cl

fom on atom is four electrons short of the noble gas Structure, so it
each for ends. and the chlorine atoms are one electron short, so they
all four oa ne bond. By Sharing electrons in this way, both the carbon and

chiorine atoms attain a noble &as Structure. It must be emphasized
