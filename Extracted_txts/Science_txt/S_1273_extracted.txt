INTRODUCTION TO BONDING.

 

 

that although 11s possible to build up mofecules i this way in ordet to
understand their electronic structures, st does not follow that the atoms will
react together directly In this case, carbon and chlorime do not react
Girectly, and tetrachloromethane 1s made by indirect reactions

‘A molecule of ammonia NH 1s made up of one nitrogen and three
hydrogen ators

N +3] J+H ON OH

H

‘The nitrogen atom s three electrons short of a noble gas structure, andthe
hydrogen atoms are one electron short of a noble gas structure Nitrogen
forms three bonds, and the hydrogen atoms one bond each, so all four
‘atoms attain a stable configuration One patt of electrons on the N atoms
rot involved in bond formation and this s called a fone parr of electrons

Other examples of covalent bonds include water (with two covalent
bonds and two lone parts of electrons), and hydrogen fluoride (one
covalent bond and three fone pasts)

‘Oxidation numbers,

‘The oxidation number of an element in a covalent compound 1s calculated
by assigning shared electrons to the more electronegative element, and
‘then counting the theoretical charge left on each atom (Electronegatiity
4s desenbed in Chapter 6) An alternative approach 1 to break up
(gheoretically) the molecule by removing all the atoms as rons, and
‘counting the charge left on the central atom It must be emphasized that
‘molecules are not really broken, nor electrons really moved For example
10 HO, removal of two H™ leaves a charge of ~2 on the oxygen atom +0
the oxidation state of O an HO 1s (—I1) Similarly en HS the oxidation
state of § 1s (—I1), m F,O the oxidation state of O 1s (+Il), in SFs the
‘oxidation state of S ts (+1V) whilst in SFy the oxidation state of $6
(VD The concept of oxidation numbers works equally well with 1onic
‘compounds and in CrCl the Cr atom has an oxidation state of (+111) and

stforms Cr°* tons Simularly in CrCl, Cr has the oxidation state (+11) and
exsts as CY sons

 

 

Coordinate bonds

A covalent bond results from the sharing ofa pair of electrons between (WO
‘atoms where each atom contributes one electron to the bond It 1s also
