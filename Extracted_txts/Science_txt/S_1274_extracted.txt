possible to have an electron pair bond where both electrons originate from
one atom and none from the other. Such bonds are called coordinate bonds
or dative bonds. Since, in coordinate bonds, two electrons are shared by
two atoms, they differ from normal covalent bonds only in the way they
are formed, and once formed they are identical to normal covalent
bonds.

Even though the ammonia molecule has a stable electron configuration,
it can react with a hydrogen ion H* by donating a share in the lone pair of
electrons, forming the ammonium ion NH?:

H Hy Hy"
. - |
H:N:+{H}]* > |H:N:H] or} H—N>-H
= . - |
H H H

Covalent bonds are usually shown as straight lines joining the two atoms,
and coordinate bonds as arrows indicating which atom is donating the
electrons. Similarly ammonia may donate its lone pair to boron trifluoride,
and by this means the boron atom attains a share in eight electrons:

H F H F

H:N:+B:F —+ H—N-B—F
H F H F

In a similar way, a molecule of BF; can form a coordinate bond by
accepting a share in a lone pair from a F~ ion.

There are many other examples, including:

PCI, + CI” - [PCI]
SbF + F~ — [SbF,]-

ore than two electrons are shared between a pair of atoms. If
's are shared, then there are two bonds, and this arrangement

louble bond. If six electrons are shared then there are three
this is called a triple bond:
