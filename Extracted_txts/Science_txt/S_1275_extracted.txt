Meratlie bonds and metallic steuctures

‘Metals ate made up of positive tons packed together usually m one ofthe
thee following arrangements

1 Cubic efose packed (also called face centred cubic)
2 Hexagonal close packed
3. Body centred eubre

Negatively charged electrons hold the sons together The number of
positive and negate charges are exactly balanced as the elections
‘onginated from the neutral metal atoms The outstanding feature of metals
ss their extremely high electrical conductnty and thermal conductivty
both of which are because of the mobility of these electrons through the
face

“The arrangements of atoms inthe three common metal structures 3%
shown in Figure 22 Two ofthese arrangements (cubic close packed and
hexagonal close packed) are based on the closest packing of spheres The
metal ons are assumed fo be spherical and ate packed together to ill the
space most effectively as shown 1n Figure 2 3a Each sphere touches 5
other spheres within this one layer

‘A second layer of spheres 18 arranged on top of the first fayer the
protrusng parts ofthe second layer ftong into the hollows inthe fist aye!
asshown in Figure 2 4a A sphere in the fist layer touches three spheres @
the layer above t and similarly touches three spheres in the layer below
plus six spheres wn its own layer making a total of 12 The coordination
number of number of atoms or ions in contact with a given ator 3
Uhetefore 12 fora close packed arrangement With a close packed arrange
tment the spheres occupy 74% of the total space

‘When adding a third layer of spheres two different arrangements a
‘possible each preservmg the close packed arrangement

the first sphere ofthe thutd layer s placed in the depression X show? 9
Figure 2 4a then this sphere s exactly above a sphere «nthe fst layer It
Jollows that every sphere in the thitd layer 1s exactly above a sphere in the
first layer as showa in Figure 2 2a If the fist layer is represented by A. 299
the second layer by B. the repeating pattern of close packed sheets
ABABAB ‘This structure has hexagonal symmetry and ts there/OF
sand to be hexagonal close packed

Atternatwely the fit sphere of the third layer may be placed 29 >
