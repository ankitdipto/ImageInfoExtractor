Conductrvty

Tome compounds conduct electnety when the compound 1 melted, or
1m solution Conduction 1s achieved by the 1ons migrating towards the
electrodes under the influence of an electric potential If an electric current
ts passed through a solution of sodium chloride Na* tons are attracted 9
the negatwely charged electrode (cathode) where they gain an electzon
and form sodium atoms ‘Thé Civ sons are atitacted 10 the postive
electrode (anode) where they lose an electron and become chlotine
atoms This process 1s called electrolysis The changes amount 10 the
ttansfet of electrons from cathode to anode, but conduction occurs By an
tonic mecharusm involving the migraton of both postive and negatve tons
1m opposte directions

In the sold state the 1ons are trapped in fised places mn the crystal
fatuce, and as they eannot migrate, they cannot conduct electricity sm this
way Its, however, wrong to say that iomse solids do not conduct electriaty
‘without qualifying the statement The crystal may conduct electricity fo a
very small extent by semiconduchon sf the crystal contains some defeens
Suppose that a lattice site is unoccupied, and there 28a ‘hole” where af von
1s missing An 10n may migrate from sts Jatice site to the vacant site, and
1m so doing st makes a hole’ somewhere else The new ‘holes filled by
another 1on_ and so on, so eventually the hole migrates across the crystal
and a charge iscarned inthe other direction Plainly the amount of curent
cared by this mechanism 1s extremely small, but semiconductors re of
-rcat importance in modern electronic devices

Metals conduct electneny better than any other material, but the
‘mechanisn s by the movement of electrons mstead of ions

Covalent compounds contain neither sons (as sn ronte compounds) nor
mobile electrons (as in metals), 50 they are unable to conduct electricity in
eather the sold, quid or gaseous state Covalent compounds are therefore
rnsulators

Solubility

If they disolve at all, rome compounds are usually soluble in polar
solvents These are solvents of high dielectricconstant such a5 Water, Othe
mmneral acids Covalent compounds are aot normally saluble 1 these
solvents but if they dissolve at all they are soluble in non polar (organ)
solvents of low dhelecine constant, such as benzene and tettachloro
methane ‘The general rules sometimes stated that “ike dissolves lke’, dnd
30 rome compounds usually dissolve in sonic solvents, and covalent
compounds usually dissolve in covalent solvents

Speed of reactions

Tome compounds usually react very rapidly, whilst covalent compounds
‘usually react slowly For tome reactions to occur, the reacting species 3r@
