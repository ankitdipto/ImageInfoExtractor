8 are common and the appropriate lumting radius ratios can be worked
‘out by simple geometry, and are shown in Table 3 1

‘fthe omc radi are known the radhus ratio can be calculated and hence
the coordination number and shape may be predicted ‘This simple concept
bredhets the correct structure i many cases

‘CALCULATION OF SOME LIMITING RADIUS RATIO VALUES:

‘This sechon may be skipped except by those interested in the ortgin of the
luting radvus ratio values

Coordination number 3 (planar trangle)

Figure 3 2a shows the smaller positwe ron af radius r* mn contact wth theee
farger negative rons of radius r~ Plainly AB = BC = AC = 2. BE=r",
BD =r" +r” Farther, the angle A~B-C1s 60°, and the angle D-B-E's
30° By trigonometry

£08 30" = BE/BD

BO = BEM 37
P+ =r l008 30° = 7°10 866 = ro x 1155
P= (L155) — = 0 155>

hence he = 0155

  

Coordination number 4 (tetrahedeal)

Figure 3 2 shows a tetrahedral arrangement mscribed in a cube Part of
‘this tetrahedral arrangement 1s drawn 1n Figure 3 2¢ It can be seen thal the
angle ABC 1 the tetrahedral angle of 109°28’ and hence the angle ABD it
half of this, that 1s $4°44" In the tnangle ABD
