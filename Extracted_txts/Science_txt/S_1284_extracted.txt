hence

r/r~ = 0,225

Coordination number 6 (octahedral)

A cross-section thro

ugh an octahedral site is shown in Figure 3.2d, and the
smaller positive ion

(of radius r*) touches six larger negative ions (of radius
r). (Note that only four negative ions are shown in this section, and one is
above and another below the plane of the Paper.) It is obvious that AB =
™ +r and BD = r~. The angle ABC is 45°. In the triangle ABD

SS ABD = 0.797, - BD ~
