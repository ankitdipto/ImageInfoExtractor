‘CLOSE PACKING

“Many common crystal structures are related to, and may be described in
terms of, hexagonal or cubic close-packed arrangements Because of theit
shape, spheres cannot fill space completely. Ina close-packed arrangement
‘ofspheres, 78% of the space is ile. Thus 26% of the space 1s unoccupied,
and may be regarded as holes inthe crystal latuce. Two diferent types of
hole occur Some are bounded by four spheres and are called tetrahedral
holes (marked T in Figure 3 3a), and others are bounded by six spheres
and ate called octahedral holes (marked O mn Figure 3.3a). For every
