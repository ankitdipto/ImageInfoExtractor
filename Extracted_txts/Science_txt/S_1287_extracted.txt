ray be regarded as a cube close packed array of CI~ sons, with Na* sons
‘occupying all the octahedral holes

Caesum chlonde structure

In caesium chlonde CsCl, the radius ratio 18 093 This indicates 2 body
centred cubic type of arrangement, whete each Cs” 1on 8 surraunded by
fight CI" rons and vie versa (Figure 3 6) The coordaation 1s chus 8 8
Note that this structure snot close packed and snot strictly body centred
cubic

In body centeed cube arrangement the atom atthe centre ofthe cube
ssidentyeal to those at the corners. This structure 1s found in metals, but n
CsCl if the ions atthe corners are CI” then there willbe a Cs® son atthe
body centred postion so tis not strictly body centred cubic ‘The caesumt
chloride structure should be described as a body centred cubic pe of
arrangement and not body cenired cubic

IONIC COMPOUNDS OF THE TYPE AX: (CaF:, T:Oz, $102)

‘The two most common structures are Suonte, CaF; (Figure 37), and
rutile, TiO, (Figure 38), and many difluondes and dioxides have one of
these structures Another fairly common structure 1s one form of SiO;
called B crstobalue (Figuee 39) These are teue tonic structures Layer
structures are formed instead if the bonding becomes appreciably covalent

Calcium fluoride (fluomte) structure

In fuonte each Ca?* ron 1s surrounded by eight Fons, giving & body
czntsed cubic arrangement of F™ sound Cat™ Sines these are twice a8
many F” rons as Ce?* sons, the coordination number of both rons
<iferent, and four Ca?* rons are tetrahedrally arranged around each F”
ton The coordination numbers are therefore 8 and 4, so ths 1 called an
8 arrangement The fluonte structure 1s found when the radius ratio
073 or above

‘An alternate description ofthe structure 1s thatthe Ca2* sons form a
face centred cubic arrangement The Ca** rons are too small to touch each
other, s0 the structure 1s not close packed However, the structure
related to a close packed arrangement, since the Ca?™ occupy the stme
felative positions 28 for a cubic close packed structure, and the F~ 10ns
‘ceupy al the tetrahedeal hotes

Ronle structure

TiO; exists m three forms called anatase, brookite and rutyle The rutile
structure ws found in many crystals where the radius ratio 1s between O41
‘and 073 ‘This soggests a coordination number of 6 for ane ron and from
the formuta i follows that the coordination number of the other ron must
