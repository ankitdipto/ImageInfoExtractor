side This called a layer structure, and it not a completely regular onc
structure With a sandwich, bread 1s separated from bread by the meat, but
1m pite of sandwiches, bread from one sandwich touches bread from the
next sandwich Similarly, in Cdl, two sheets of I~ 1ons are separated by
(Cé?* within a ‘sandwich’, bt between one ‘sandwich’ and the next, two I~
layers are n contact. Whilst there 1s strong electrostatie bonding between
Cé** and I” layers, there are only weak van der Waals forces holding the
adjacent layers of I~ together The packing of layers the crystal structure
1s not completely regular, and the solid 1s flaky, and it cleaves into two
parallel sheets quite easly This structure 1s adopted by many transiton
metal duodides (Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cd) and by some main group
‘duodides and dibromides (Mg, Ca, Ge and Pb) Many hydroxides have
sumilar tayer structures (Mg(OH)z, Ca(OH):. Fe(OH):, Co(OH):.
Ni(OH):, and Cd(OH).

In cadmum sodide, the third layer of I” rons 1s directly above the fst
layer. s0 the repeating pattern 1s ABABAB The I” sons may be
regarded as an approximately hexagonal close-packed arrangement ‘The
Ce" tons occupy half of the octahedral sites Rather than half filling the
‘octahedral sites in a regular way throughout the whole structure, all ofthe
‘octahedral sites are filed between two I” layers, and none of the octa-
hedral sites 1s filled between the, next two layers of I” rons All ofthe
‘octahedral holes are filled between the next two layers of I~ ons, none
between the next parr, and 50 on
