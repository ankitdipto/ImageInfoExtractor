Cell surface receptor

_/ Adenylyl cyclase Phospholipase C

  

(a) cAMP pathway (b) Ca** pathway

FIGURE 7.9

How second messengers work. (a) The cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway. An extracellular receptor binds to a signal molecule and, through a
G protein, activates the membrane-bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP, which binds to the
target protein to initiate the cellular change. (}) The calcium (Ca*+) pathway. An extracellular receptor binds to another signal molecule
and, through another G protein, activates the enzyme phospholipase C. This enzyme stimulates the production of inositol trisphosphate,
which binds to and opens calcium channels in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca** is released into the cytoplasm, effecting a
change in the cell.

Calmodulin

 

FIGURE 7.10
Calmodulin. (a)
Calmodulin is a protein
containing 148 amino acid
residues that mediates
Ca* function. (#) When
four Ca* are bound to the
calmodulin molecule, it
undergoes a
conformational change
that allows it to bind to
other cytoplasmic proteins

and effect cellular ()
responses.
