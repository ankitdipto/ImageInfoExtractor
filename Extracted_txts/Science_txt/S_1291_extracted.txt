‘Simularly calcite, CaCOs, has a structure related to NaCl, but the planar
angular CO}" ton distorts the unt cell along a threefold axis of
symmetry, rather than along one of the cell axes Several divalent metal
carbonates a number of nitrates, LINO, and NaNOs, and some borates,
ScBOs, YBOs and InBOy, also have the catate structure

 

‘A MORE CRITICAL LOOK AT RADIUS RATIOS

To a first approxmmation, the relative numbers and sizes of the rons will
determine the structure ofthe crystal The radiss ratios ofthe alkal metal
halides and the alkaline earth metal oxides, sulphides. selenides and
tellundes are shown in Table 33

All ofthe crystals witha radius ratio between 0 41 and 0 73 enclosed by
full ine sn Table 3 3) would be expected to have the sodium chlonde
structure Ta fact all but four of the compounds listed have a sodium
chloride structure at normal temperatures A lot more compounds edopt
the NaCl structure than would te predicted The exceptions are CsCl,
CsBr and Cs, which have a caesium chlonde structure, and MgTe, which
has zine sulphide structure RbCl and RbBr are tnusual since they both
form a NaCI structure with a coordinatton number of 6 when erystallized at
normal room temperatures and pressures, but they adopt a CsCl structure
with a coordination number of 8 if erystallized at hugh pressures or
temperatures ‘The fact that they can form both structures indicates thatthe
shfference i lattice energy between the two structures s small, and hence
there 1s only a small difference in stability between them

‘A CAUTIONARY WORD ON RADIUS RATIOS

Radus ratios provide 2 useful guide to what 1s possible on geometric
‘grounds, and also a first guess at the likely structure, but there are other
factors involved Radius ratios do not necessarily provide a completely
relrable method for predicting which structure 1s actually adopted
