THE IONIC BOND

 

 

usualy havea centre of symmetry The arrangement of electrons in these d
orbitals gives nse to Jahn-Teller distortion (See Chapter 28 ) A partially
filed d orbital pointing towards @ coordinated 10n wall repel it A
completely filled d orbital will repel the ion even more This can give nse to
fa structure vith some long and some short bonds, depending on both the
‘electronic structure ofthe metal ion, and the crystal structure adopted 1€
the positions of the coordinating rons

Itys most unlikely that bonding ts ever 100% ionic The retention of 2
NaCI structure by a number of compounds which might be expected 10
adopt a CSCI structure 1s largely because there 1s a small covalent contn
bution tothe bonding The three p orbitals are at 90° to each other, and:n
‘NaCl structure they point towards the six nearest neighbours, so covalent
‘overlap of orbitals ws possible The geometnc arrangement of the NaCl
structure 1s ideally sued to allow some covalent contnbution to bonding
‘This not $0 for the CsCl structure

Thus radws rauos provide a rough guide to what structures are geo
metrcally possible Radius ratios often predict the correct structure, but
they do not always predict the correct structure Ultimately the reason why

LATTICE ENERGY

‘The lattice energy (U) of a crystal 1s the energy evolved when one gram
molecule of the erystal is formed from gaseous tons

Lattice energies cannot be measured directly, but experimental values ar€
obtained from thermodynamic data using the Born—Haber cycle (see
Chapter 6)
