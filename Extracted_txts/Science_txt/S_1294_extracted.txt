A isthe Madelung constant, which depends on the geometry of the crystal

Values for the Madelung constant have been calculated for all common
crystal structures, by summing the contributions of all the ions in the
crystal lattice. Some values are given in Table 3.4. (It should be noted that
different values from these are sometimes given where the term z*z™ is
replaced by z”, where z is the highest common factor in the charges on the
ions. The Madelung constant is rewritten M = Az*z~/z*. This practice is
not recommended.)

The equation for the attractive forces between the ions gives a negative
value for energy, that is energy is given out when a crystal is formed. The
inter-ionic distance r occurs in the denominator of the equation. Thus the
smaller the value of r, the greater the amount of energy evolved when the
crystal lattice is formed, and hence the more stable the crystal will be.
Mathematically, the equation suggests that an infinite amount of energy
should be evolved if the distance r is zero. Plainly this is not so. When the
inter-ionic distance becomes small enough for the ions to touch, they begin
to repel each other. This repulsion originates from the mutual repulsion of
the electron clouds on the two atoms or ions. The repulsive forces increase
Tapidly as r decreases. The repulsive force is given by B/r”, where B is a
