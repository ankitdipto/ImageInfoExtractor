‘This equation gwes a calculated value of U = ~778kSmol~ for the

Other expressions, for example the Born-Mayer and Kapustinsk
‘equations, are similar, but calculate the repulsive contribution in a slightly
different way Agreement s even better if allowances are made for van det
Waals forces and zero point energy

Several important points arise from the Born-Lande equation
