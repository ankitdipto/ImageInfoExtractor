1. The lattice becomes stronger (i.e. the lattice energy U becomes more
negative), as r the inter-ionic distance decreases. U is proportional
to Ur.

r(A) — -U (kJmo!™')
LiF 2.01 1004
CsI 3.95 —527

2, The lattice energy depends on the product of the ionic charges, and U
is proportional to (z*.z7).

r(A) 9 (z*.z7) —-U (kJ mol“)
LiF 2.01 1 —1004
MgO 210 4 —3933

3. The close agreement between the experimental lattice energies and
those calculated by the Born—Landé equation for the alkali metal
halides does not of itself prove that the equation itself, or the assump-
tions on which it is based, are correct. The equation is remarkably self-
compensating, and tends to hide errors. There are two opposing factors
in the equation. Increasing the inter-ionic distance r reduces the lattice
energy. It is almost impossible to change r without changing the struc-
ture, and therefore changing the Madelung constant A. Increasing A
increases the lattice energy: hence the effects of changing r and A may
largely cancel each other.

This may be illustrated by choosing a constant value for n in the
Born-Landé equation. Then changes in inter-ionic distance can be cal-
culated for either changes in the coordination number, or in crystal
structure. Taking a constant value of n = 9, we may compare the inter-
ionic distances with those for six-coordination:

Coordination number 12 8 6 4
Ratio of inter-ionic distance 1.091 1.037 1.000 0.951

For a change of coordination number from 6 (NaCl structure) to 8
(CsCl structure) the inter-ionic distance increases by 3.7%, and the
Madelung constants (NaCl A = 1.74756, and CsCl A = 1.76267) change
by only 0.9%. Thus a change in coordination number from 6 to 8 would
Tesult in a reduction in lattice energy, and in theory the NaC! structure
should always be more stable than the CsCl structure. In a similar way
Teducing the coordination number from 6 to 4 decreases r by 4.9%. The
decrease in A is 6.1% or 6.3% (depending on whether a zinc blende or
Wurtzite structure is formed), but in either case it more than com-
Pensates for the change in r, and in theory coordination number 6 is
more stable than 4.
e This suggests that neither four- nor eight-coordinate structures should
exist, since the six-coordinate NaCl structure is more stable. Since ZnS
para (coordination number 4), and CsCl, CsBr and CsI have a co-
Tdination number of 8, this suggestion is plainly incorrect. We must
