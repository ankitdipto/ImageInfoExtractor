therefore look for a mistake inthe theoretical assumptions made Fist
the value of n was assumed to be 9, when st may vary from 5 to 12
‘Second, the calculation of electrostatic attraction assumes that the 1ons
are point charges Third, the assumption 1s made that there 1s no
reduction in charge because of the interaction (1 e. the bonds ate 100%
tonic)

Ceystals with @ high lattice energy usually melt at hugh tempera-
tures, and are very hard Hardness 1s measured on Mohs’ scale (See
Appendix N) High lattice energy 1s favoured by a small snter-onie
distance, and a high charge on the 1ons

It has been seen that a number of salts which might be ‘expected from
radius ratio considerations to have a CsCl structure in fact adopt a NaCl
Structure The Madelung constant for CsCl is larger than for NaCl. and
would give an increased latuce energy However, the interionic distance
will be larger in a CsCl type of structure than im a NaCl type of structure,
and this would decrease the lattice energy These two factors work i
opposite directions and partly cancel each other “This makes the ltee
energy more favourable for a NaCl type of latice in some eases where #
CSCI structure 1s geometrically possible Consider a case such as RbBr
where the radus rato 1s close to borderline between stx-coordinaion
(NaCI structure) and eight coordination (CSCI structure) If the CsCl
Structure 6 adopted, the Madelung constant lafger than for NaCI. and
this increases te lauice energy by 0 86% At the same time the mer-10N%
distance in a CsC! structure increases by 3%, and dhs decreases the alte
energy by 3% Clearly the NaCl structure is preferred

FEATURES OF SOLIDS

The essential feature of crystalline solids that the constituent molecules.
