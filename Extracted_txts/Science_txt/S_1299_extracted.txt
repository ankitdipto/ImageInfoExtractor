number of alternative snterstital positions per cm", Wr 1s the work
necessary to form a Frenkel defect, k1s the gas constant and T the absolute
temperature

‘The energy needed to form either a Schottky defect or a Frenkel defect
depends on the work needed to form the defect, and on the temperature
Ina given compound one type generally predominates,

In NaCl, the energy to form a Schottky defect 1s about 200k! mal”
compared ‘with a lattice energy of approximately 750K3mol~! It
therefore much easter to form 2 defect than to break the latuice

‘The number of defects formed 1s relatwvely small, and at room tempera
ture NaCI has only one defect n 10" lattice sites, this value nising tone
10" stes at 500°C and one an 10" sites at 800°C

‘A consequence of these defects 1s that a crystalline sold that has defects

mechanism If an ion moves from its lattice site to occupy a ‘hole’

Crystals with Frenkel defects have only one type of hole, but crystals
containing Schottky defects have holes from both positive and negate
tons, and conduction may anise by using either one type of hole or both
lypes Migration of the smaller ion (usually the posite ton) into the
appropnate holes ss favoured at low temperatures, since moving a small
