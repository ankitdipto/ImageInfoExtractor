‘The crvstal lattice has vacant amon sites, which are occupied by
‘electrons Anion sites occupied by electrons im this way are called F
centres (Fs an abbreviation for Farbe, the German word for colour )
‘These F centres are associated with the colour of the compound and the
more Fecentres present, the greater the intensity of the coloration Soliés
containing F centres are paramagnetic, because the electrons occupying
the vacant sites are unpaired When materials with F-centres are rradiated
with ight they become photoconductors When electrons in the F centres
absorb sufficer* light (or heat) energy, the electron 1s promoted into a
conductian band, rather similar to the conduction bands present in metals
Since conduction 1s by electrons it 16m type seruconduction

Interstital ons and electrons

Metal excess defects also occur when an extra positive ron occupies an
ntersital postion inthe lattice, and etectrical neutrality 1s marntained by
the inclusion ofan interstitial electron (see Figure 3 16) ‘Thesr composition
may be represented by the general formala Ar4sX

‘This type of defect ts rather like @ Frenkel defect m that 1ons occupy
intersttal positions, but there are no ‘holes’, and there are also interstitial
electrons Ths kind of metal excess defect 1s much more common than the
first, and 1s formed 1n crystals which would be expected to form Frenkel
defects (We the rons are appreciably different mn stze, have a low co
ordination number, and have some covalent character) Examples melude
ZnO, CdO, Fe;Or and Cray

If this type of defect oxide 1s heated sn dioxygen, then cooled to room
temperature, sts conductity decreases This 1s because the dioxyges
oxidiees some of the interstitial tons, and these subsequently remove
interstitial electrons, which reduces the conductivity

Crystals with either type of metal excess defect contain free electron,
and if these migrate they conduct an electric current Since there are only
small number of defects, there are only a few free electrons that cen
conduct electricity Thus the amount of current carned 1s very small
‘compared with that m metas, fused salts or salts in aqueous solutions, ad
these defect matenals are called semiconductors Since the mechanism
‘normal electron conduction, these are called type semiconductors These
fice electrons may be excited to higher energy levels giving absorption
spectra, and an consequence their compounds are often coloured. € &
