Si and Ge at very low temperatures the valence band 1s filled and the
conduction band is empty Under these conditions. St and Ge are both
insulators and cannot carry any electric current

‘The band gaps are only 6&kJ mot” for Ge. and 106kI mol”! for Si, and
4a room temperature 4 few valence electrons gain sufficient energy from
the thermal vibration of the atoms to be promoted into the conduction
fband I the crystal 1s connected in an electeic circurt, these thermally
excited clectrons carry a small current, and make the Si or Ge crystal
slightly conducting This ws termed intrviste semuconduction Expressed in
another way some bonds are broken, and these valence electrons can
migrate and conduct electetity

AAs the temperature w increased the conductwity increases, that the
electrical resistance decreases (Thus 1s the opposite of the situation with
metals ) Above 100°C so many valence electrons are promoted to the
conduction band in Ge thatthe ervstal latuce disintegrates “With Si the
‘maximum working temperature is 150°C This intrinsic semiconduction
undesirable and precautions must be taken to limit the working tempet®
ture of transistors

Pure Si and Ge can be made semiconducting 1n a controlled way by
adding impurities which act as charge carriers tor Ge are first obtaned
extremely pure by zone refining Some atoms with five outer electrons
Such as arsenic As ate deliberately added to the silicon ervstal Ths
process 1 called “doping* the crystal A minute proportion of Si atoms are
andomly replaced by As atoms with five electrons in their outer shell
Only four of the outer electrons on each As atom are required to form
bonds in the lattice At absolute zero or low temperatures, the fith
electron is localized on the As atom However, at normal temperatures
some of these fifth electrons on AS are excited into the conduction band
where they ean carry current quite readily This is extnnste conduction, and
ft aereases the amount of semiconduction far above that possible by
intoinsic conduction Since the current x carried by excess electrons,
fn ype semiconduction

Alternanvely a crystal of pure $i may be doped with some atoms wih
nly theee outer electrons. such as indium In Each indium ator Uses HS
