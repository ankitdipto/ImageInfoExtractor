base to the emitter. There is thus a small base current. However, the base
is very thin, and the collector has a much greater negative voltage, so most
of the positive holes pass through the base to the collector, where they
combine with electrons from the circuit. At the emitter, electrons leave the
p-type semiconductor and enter the circuit, and in doing so they produce
more positive holes. Typically, if the emitter current is 1mA, the base
current is 0.02 mA, and the collector current 0.98mA.

The most common method of using a transistor as an amplifier is the
common or grounded emitter circuit (Figure 3.224). The emitter is
common to both the base and collector circuits, and is sometimes grounded
(earthed). The base current is the input signal, and the collector current is
the output signal. If the base current is reduced, for example by increasing
R,, the base becomes Positively charged, and this reduces the movement of
Positive holes to the collector. In a typical transistor, a change in the base
current can produce a change 50 times as great in the collector current,
Slving a current amplification factor of 50. A small change in input current
to the base produces a much larger change in the collector current, so the
original signal is amplified.

In practice the bias for both the base and the collector are often obtained

from one battery by having the resistance of R, much greater than that of
2 (Figure 3.22b).
