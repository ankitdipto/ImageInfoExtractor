THE IONIC BOND.

 

 

Finally, np transistors work m a simular way, except that the polanty
‘of the bas voltges 1s reversed so the collector and base are positive wth
respect to the emitter

[MICRO MINATURIZED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

Tt as now possible to manufacture computer chips with the equwvalent of,
many thousands of single erystal transistor yunctions on a small wafer of
silicon, only a few millimetres square (Memory chips for computers are
readily available which store 64K 256K 1 megabyte and even 4 megabytes
‘of data on a single chip )

‘The steps in the manufacture of such chips 1s

1A farly large single crystal of St 1s doped to make it an n type semi
conductor, and then itis carefully cut nto thin slices

2A shice 1s heated in at to form a thin surface layer of SiO

3. The oxide layer 1s then coated with a photosensitive film, sometimes
called a photoresist

4 A mask s placed over the photoresist and the shice 1s exposed to UV
light Those parts of the photoresist exposed 10 light are changed and
are removed by treatment with acid but the unexposed parts remain
protected by the photoresist

5. The shce 1s then treated with HF, which etches (removes) the exposed
areas of SiOz AVter this, the unchanged photoresist 1s removed

{6 The surface is exposed to the vapour of a Group 13 element Some of
the surface 1s covered by a film of S103, and some has exposed silicon
‘The parts cavered by a $10; film are unaffected, but inthe parts where
the silicon itself 1s exposed, some Si atoms sre randomly replaced,
forming a layer ofp type semiconductor

7 ‘The steps (2) to (5) are repeated using a different mask, and the exposed
ateas of Si exposed to the vapour of a Group 15 element, to produce
another layer of m type semiconductor

8 Steps (2) to (5) ate repeated using a mask to produce the openings
anto which metal can be deposited to ‘wire together" the vanous sea!

conductors $0 produced into an integrated circut

Finally the chyp 1s packaged in plastic or ceramic, connecting pins ©

soldered on so that t may be plugged in to a socket on a circutt board

and the chips tested A significant number turn out to be faulty Faulty

chups cannot be repaired, and are discarded
