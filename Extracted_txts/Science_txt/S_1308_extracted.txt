PROBLEMS °

1. Relate the tendency of atoms to gain or lose electrons to the types of
bonds they form.

2. Indicate to what extent the following will conduct electricity, and give

the mechanism of conduction in each case:
(a) NaCl (fused)

(b) NaCl (aqueous solution)

{c) NaCl (solid)

(8) Cu (solid)

(©) CCl, (liquid).

» Why are ionic compounds usually high melting, whilst most simple
covalent compounds have low melting points? Explain the high
melting point of diamond.
