How are the minimum values of radius ratio arnved at for vanous
coordination numbers, and what are these lumits? Give examples of
the types of crystal structure associated with each coordination
number

‘Show by means of a diagram, and a simple calculation, the mnimom
value of the radius rato r*/r™ which permuts a salt to adopt a caesium
chloride type of structure

Give the coordination numbers of the ions and describe the crystal
structures of zinc blende, wurtzite and sodium chlonde in terms of
‘lose packing and the occupancy of tetrahedral and octahedral holes

CC5CI Cal, ICL and TH all adopt caesium chlonde structure The
unter tonic distances are Cs~C1 306A, Cs-1341A TI-C1 255A
and-11-12.90A_Assumang thatthe rons behave as hard speres nd
that the radu eato nT has the mitng value, calculate the one
radu for Cs*, Th*, CI-, 17 un eight coordination

White down the Born-Lande equation and define the terms int Use
the equation to show why some crystals, which according to the rads
ratio concept should adopt @ coordination number of 8. i fact havea
coordination number of 6

 

‘Outline a Born—Haber cycle for the formation of an onic compound
MCI Define the terms used and state how these might be measured ot
calculated How do these enthalpy terms vary throughout the period
table? Use these variations 0 suggest how the properties of NaCl
smught differ from those of CuCl

Explain the term fattice energy as applied to an tonic solid. Caleutate
the lattice energy of caesium chloride using the following data

Ca(s) ~» Cs(g) AH = +79 9kImol~
