are given for the first row transition metals:

Sc Ti VY oCr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu
AH*kJ mol“! —339 —209 —138 —160 +22 -59 +131 +280 +357

Use a Born—Haber cycle to account for the change in AH” as the
atomic number of the metal increases. Comment on the relative
stabilities of the +II and +III oxidation states of the 3d metals.

. List the types of defect that occur in the solid state and give an example

of each. Explain in each case if any electrical conduction is possible
and by what mechanism.
