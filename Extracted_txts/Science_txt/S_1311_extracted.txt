INTRODUCTION

‘Thete are several different theories which explain the electronic structures
and shapes of known molecules, and attempt to predict the shape of
molecules whose structures are so far unknown Each theory has is ova
‘tues and shortcomings None 1s rigorous Theones change m the light of
new knowledge and fashion If we knew or could prove what a bond was
We would not need theories, which by defimtion cannot be proved ‘The
Value of a theory lies more in its usefulness than ints truth Being able to
predict the shape of a mofecule 1s important In many cases all the theones
‘ave the correct answer

‘THE LEWIS THEORY

The octet rule

‘The Lewis theory was the first explanation ofa covalent bond in ters of
electrons that was generally accepted If two electrons are shared between
{wo atoms, this constitutes a bond and binds the atoms together For many
Iight atoms a stable arrangement attained when the atom is surrounded
by eight electrons ‘This octet ean be made up from some electrons wich
are “totally owned’ and some electrons which are ‘shared’ ‘Thus atoms
continue to form bonds until they have made up an octet of electrons TH
sscalled the ‘octet rule" The “cet rule explans the observed valenciesin
lange number of cases There are exceptions to the octet rule, for example,
hydrogen is stable with only two electrons Other exceptions are discussed
later A chlorine atom has seven electrons an fs outer shell 0 by shar
