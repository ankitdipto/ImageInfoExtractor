Ina similar way, a nitrogen atom has five outer electrons, and in NH3
it shares three of these, forming three bonds and thus attaining an octet.
Hydrogen has only one electron, and by sharing it attains a stable arrange-
ment of two electrons.

In a similar way an atom of oxygen attains an octet by sharing two
electrons in H2O and an atom of fluorine attains an octet by sharing one
electron in HF.

Double bonds are explained by sharing four electrons between two
atoms, and triple bonds by sharing six electrons.

Exceptions to the octet rule

The octet rule is broken in a significant number of cases:

1. For example, for atoms such as Be and B which have less than four
outer electrons. Even if all the outer electrons are used to form bonds
an octet cannot be attained.

which is close in

energy to the p level, and may accept electrons and be
