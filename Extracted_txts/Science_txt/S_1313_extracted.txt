THE COVALENT BOND

 

 

used for bonding PFs obeys the octet rule, but PFs does not PF. has
ten outer electrons, and uses one 3s, three 3p and one 3d orbitals Any
compound with more than four covalent bonds must break the octet
rule, and these violations become ancreesingly common in elements
after the first two periods of eight elements in the periodic table

3 The octet rule does not work in molecules which have an odd number
‘of electrons, such as NO and C1Oz, nor does it explain why Op para
magnetic and has two unpaired electrons

Despite these exceptions, the octet rule 1s surpnsingly reliable and did a
great deal to explain the number of bonds formed in simple cases. How
ever, it gives no indication of the shape adopted by the molecule

SIDGWICK-POWELL THEORY

In 1940 Sidgvick and Powell (see Further Reading) reviewed the stve
tures of molecules then known ‘They suggested that for molecules and
tons that only contain single bonds, the approximate shape can be pre
dicted from the numberof electron pais ithe outer of valence shell of
the central atom The outer shell contains one or more bond pans of
electrons, but st may also contain unshared pairs of electrons (lo pats)
‘Bond pairs and lone pars were taken as equvalen, since all electron pars
take up some space, and since all electron pars repel each other Repul
soa s minemized ifthe electron pars are onentated m space as far apartas
posible

1 If there are two paws of electrons 1n the valence shell of the central
‘atom, the orbitals containing them will be onented at 180" to each
fother It follows that af these orbitals overlap wath orbitals from other
‘atoms to form bonds, then the molecule formed will be linear

2 If there are three electron patts on the central atom, they will be st
120° to each other, ping a plane tnangular structure

For four electron pairs the angle ts 109°28", and the shape 1s tetrahedral

For five pairs, the shape 1s a trigonal bipyramid

For six pau the angles are 90° and the shape 1s octahedral

VALENCE SHELL ELECTRON PAIR REPULSION (VSEPR)
‘THEORY

In 1957 Gallespie and Nyholm (see Further Reading) improved the Sidg
wick-Powell theory to predict and explain molecular shapes and bond
angles more exacily ‘The theory was developed extensively by Gillespie 25

summanzed
