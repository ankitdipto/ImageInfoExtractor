THE COVALENT BOND }

 

Ione pair reduces the bond angles to 84°30 Whulst at might be expected
that (wo tone pairs would distort the bond angles in an octahedron suit
further, m XeF the angles are 90° Thus s because the lone parr are now
to each other in the octahedron, and hence the atoms have a reguhr
square planar arrangement

‘Molecules with five parr of electrons are all based on a tngonal by
amid Lone pauts distort the structures a5 before The lone pais aluap,
‘occupy the equatorial positions (in the triangle), rather than the ape
positions (up and down) Thus in the 15 10n the central I atom has fve
electron patrs in the outer shell, made of two bond patrs and three lone
paurs The lone paurs occupy all three equatorial positions and the thee
atoms occupy the top middle, and bottom positions inthe trigonal by
amid, thus giving a hear arrangement with a bond angle of exactly 18
(Table 42)

 

Effect of electronegatity

NF; and NHs both have structures based on a tetrahedron with one comet
‘occupied by a lone pair The high electronegativity of F pulls the bondag
electrons further away from N than in NHs_ Thus repulsion betweed
‘bond pairs 1s less in NF3 than in NH Hence the lone paur in NF causes
2 greater distortion from tetrahedral and gives a F—N—F bond angle of
102°30', compared with 107°48 an NH The same effect 1s found in 0
(bond angle 10°27’) and FO (bond angle 102°)
