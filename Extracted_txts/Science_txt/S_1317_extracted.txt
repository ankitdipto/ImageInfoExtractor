Gaseous PCI 1s covalent P (the central atom) 1s in Group 15 and so has
five electrons n the outer shell (The electromte structure of Pis 1s? 2s" 2°
4¢ Jp") All five outer electrons are used to form bonds to the five
atoms In the PCI, molecule the valence shell of the P atom contains fre
electron paurs hence the structure 18 a tngonl bipyramid There are no
Tone pairs so the structure 1s not distorted However, a trgonal bipyramid
1s not a completely regular structure since some bond angles are 50” and
‘others 120° Symmetrical structures are usually more stable than asymme
‘nical ones Thus PClc1s highly reactwe and a the sohd state 1 splits mo
[PCU]* and [PCI] ions, which have tetrahedral and octahedral sue
tures respectively, |
Chlonne tnfluoride CIF,

‘The chlonne atom 1s at the centre of the molecule and determines is
shape Clisin Group 17 and so has seven outer electrons (The electron
structure of Clis 13? 2 2p* 3s? 3p* ) Three electrons form bonds to F, and
four electrons do not take part in bonding Thus sn CIF the Ct atom has
five electron pairs in the outer shell hence the structure 1s a tngonal
bipyranmid “There are three bond pasts and two lone pans

It was noted previously that a tngonal bipyramud is not a regular shape
since the bond angles are not all the same It therefore follows thatthe
corners are not equivalent Lone pairs occupy two of the comers, and F
‘atoms occupy the other three corners Three different arrangements att
‘theoretically possible as shown in Figure 4 4

‘The most stable structure wil be the one of lowest energy, that the
fone wath the minimum repulsion between the five orbitals The greatest
repulsion occurs between two lone pairs Lone pair-bond pair repulsions
ate next strongest and bond pait-bond pair cepulsions the weakest
