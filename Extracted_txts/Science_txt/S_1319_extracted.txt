"THE COVALENT BOND

Sulphur hexafluonde SF

Sulphur 1s on Group 16 and thus has six outer electrons (The electrone
structure of $ 1s 1s? 2s? 2p* 3s? 3p' ) All six of the outer electrons are used
to form bonds with the F atoms ‘Thus in SF¢ the S has sx electron paurs
the outer shell hence the structure ss octahedral ‘There are no fone pans
‘0 the structure is completely regular with bond angles of 90°

odine heptafluonde IF

‘Thus s the only common example of a non transition element using seven

orbuals for bonding giving a pentagonal bipyramid (See Chapter 15 )
‘The total numbers of outer orbitals, bonding orbitals and lone pats are

related to the commonly occurring shapes of molecules in Table 4 1

VALENCE BOND THEORY

‘This theory was proposed by Linus Pauling who was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Chemistry mn 1954 The theory was very widely used i the period
1940-1960 Since then 1t has to some extent fallen out of fashion How
ver 18 stil much used by orgame chemists. and at provides a bass for
simple description of small inorganic molecules

‘Atoms with unpaired electrons tend to combine with other atoms which
also have unpaired electrons In this way the unpatred electrons are paired
‘up and the atoms involved all attain a stable electronic arrangement Ths
1s usualy a full shell of electrons (1 a noble gas configuration) Two
clectrons shared between two atoms constitute a bond The number of
‘bonds formed by an atom 1s usually the same as the number of unpaired
electrons in the ground state 1¢ the lowest energy state However, in
some cases the atom may form more bonds than this. This occurs by ext
tation of the atom (1 providing st with energy) when electrons which
‘were paired in the ground state are unpaired and promoted into suitable
empty orbitals This mnereases the number of unpaired electrons, and
hence the number of bonds which can be formed

‘The shape of the molecule 1s determined primanly by the directions
which the orbitals point Electrons n the valence shell of the ongina! atom
which are paced are called lone pairs

A covalent bond results from the pairing of electrons (one from each
atom) ‘The spins of the two electrons mist be opposite (antiparallel)
because of the Paul exclusion principle that no two electrons in one atomt
‘can have all four quantum numbers the same

Consider the formation of a few simple molecules,

1 In HF, H has a smply occupied s orbital that overlaps wath 2 ingly
filled 2p orbital on F "

2 In H,0 the O atom has two singly filed 2p orbitals each of which
overlaps wath 2 singly occupied s orbital from two H atoms
