3, In NH, there are three singly occupied p orbitals on N which overlap
with s orbitals from three H atoms.

4. In CH, the C atom in its ground state has the electronic configuration
1s*, 2s, 2p!, 2p} and only has two unpaired electrons, and so can form
only two bonds. If the C atom is excited, then the 2s electrons may be
unpaired, giving 1s, 2s', 2px, 2p}, 2p:. There are now four unpaired
electrons which overlap with singly occupied s orbitals on four H atoms.

The shape of the CH, molecule is not immediately apparent. The
three p orbitals p,, p, and p, are mutually at right angles to each other,
and the s orbital is spherically symmetrical. If the p orbitals were used
for bonding then the bond angle in water should be 90°, and the bond
angles in NH3 should also be 90°. The bond angles actually found differ
appreciably from these:

t CHy H—C—H = 109°28’
NH3 H—N—H = 107°48'
H20 H—O—H = 104°27'

Hybridization

The chemical and physical evidence indicates that in methane CH, there
are four equivalent bonds. If they are equivalent, then repulsion between
electron pairs will be a minimum if the four orbitals point to the corners of
a tetrahedron, which would give the observed bond angle of 109°28'.

Each electron can be described by its wave function w. If the wave
functions of the four outer atomic orbitais of C are Wass W2p,> Pap, aNd Yop’,
then the tetrahedrally distributed orbitals will have wave functions Vip?
made up from a linear combination of these four atomic wave functions.

There are four different combinations with different weighting constants
