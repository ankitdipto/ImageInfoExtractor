BF, molecule having gained a
share in three electrons by
bonding to three F atoms

 

UH
sp* hybridization of the three orbitals
in outer shell, hence structure is a planar triangle

Combining the wave functions of the 2s, 2p, and 2p, atomic orbitals gives
three hybrid sp? orbitals.

Wp) = 3 Was + ¥6 Wr,

YQ) = B Was + v6 Wap, + y2 Wp,

Vspxa = B Was 76 Yrp, — 2 W2p,

These three orbitals are equivalent, and repulsion between them is mini-
mized if they are distributed at 120° to each other giving a planar triangle.
In the hybrid orbitals one lobe is bigger than the other, so it can overlap
more effectively and hence form a stronger bond than the original atomic
orbitals, (See Table 4.3.) Overlap of the sp? orbitals with p orbitals from F
atoms gives the planar triangular molecule BF; with bond angles of 120°.
Though this gives the correct shape, the bonds are actually shorter than
would be expected for single bonds, and the reason for this is discussed
under Trihalides in Chapter 12.

The structure of a gaseous molecule of beryllium fluoride BeF, is linear
F—Be—F. Be is the central atom in this molecule and determines the
shape of the molecule formed. The ground state electronic configuration
t Be is As? 2s? This has no unpaired electrons, and so can form no bonds.
promot is supplied, an excited state will be formed by unpairing and
pron ting a 2s electron to an empty 2p-level, giving 1s? 2s' 2p}. There are

two unpaired electrons, so the atom can form the required two bonds.
