bonds using s, p and various hybrid atomic orbitals may be as shown in

Hybridization and the mixing of orbitals is a most useful concept. Mixing
of s and p orbitals is well accepted, but the involvement of d orbitals is
controversial. For effective mixing, the energy of the orbitals must be
nearly the same.

It is a common misconception that hybridization is the cause of a par-
ticular molecular shape. This is not so. The reason why any particular
shape is adopted is its energy. It is also important to remember that the
hybridized state is a theoretical step in going from an atom to a molecule,
and the hybridized state never actually exists. It cannot be detected even
spectroscopically, so the energy of hybrid orbitals cannot be measured and
can only be estimated theoretically.

THE EXTENT OF d ORBITAL PARTICIPATION IN MOLECULAR
BONDING

The bonding in PCI; may be described using hybrids of the 3s, 3p and 3d
atomic orbitals for P ~ see below. However, there are doubts as to whether
d orbitals can take part and this has led to the decline of this theory.
