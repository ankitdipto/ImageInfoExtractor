the mean values for the radial distance for diferent phosphorus orbitals
Be DAA, Sp = 055A and 3d = 24A The energy of an erbtal s
proportional to its mean radial distance, and since the 34 orbital is much
{anger it 1s much higher in energy than the 35 and 3p orbitals it woulda
first seem unhkely that hybridization involving 5, p and d orbitals cold
possibly occur

‘Several factors affect the size of orbitals The most important 1 the
charge on the atom If the atom cares a formal posttve charge then al
the electrons will be pulled in towards the nucleus The effects greatt
for the outer electrons Ifthe central P atom 1s bonded to a highly elec
tronegative element such as F, O or Cl, then the electronegative element
attracts more than its share of the bonding electrons and the F or Caton
attains a 8 charge This leaves a 54+ charge on P, which makes the
orbitals contract Since the 3d orbital contracts 1n size very much more
than the 3r and 3p orbitals the energies of the 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals may
become close enough 0 allow hybridization to occur in PCI, Hydrogen
‘does not cause this large contraction, so PH« does not exist 1
