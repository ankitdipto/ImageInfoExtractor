‘The two electron pars which form the x bonds do not affect the shape
‘of the molecule The remaining theee orbitals point to the corners of a
tangle, and result m a planar triangular structure for the molecule with
to corners occupied by O atoms and one commer occupied by a lone pat
‘The SO, molecule 1s thus angular or V shaped (Figure 4 12)

‘The x bonds do not alter the shape but merely shorten the bond lengths
‘The bond angle ws reduced from the weal value of 120° 10 119°30 because
of the repulsion by the tone pair of electrons Problems anise when we
‘examine exactly which AOs are involved in x overlap If the o bonding
‘occurs mn the xy plane then x overlap can occur between the 3p orbital of
S and the 2p orbital on one © atom to give one x bond The second x
bond involves a d orbital Though the 3d orbital on S 1s 1m the comect
onentation for zt overlap with the 2p orbital on the other © atom the
symmetry of the 34 + orbital 1s wrong (both lobes have a + sign) whilst fo
4 p orbital one tobe 1s + and the other ~ Thus overlap of these ora
docs not result in bonding The 3d, orbital on $ as mn the correct oven
tation, and has the carcectsyrametey to overlap wath the 2p orbital on the
second O atom and could ge the second x bond. Its sucprising that ®
bonds involving p and d orbitals both have the same energy (and bond
length) This cals ito question whether it 1s correct to treat motecules
wath two 2 bonds as containing two discrete x bonds A better approuch's
to treat the x bontls as heing delocalized over several atoms Examples of
this treatment are given near the end of this chapter
