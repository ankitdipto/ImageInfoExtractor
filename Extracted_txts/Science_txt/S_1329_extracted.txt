bee assocrated with all the nuclet inthe molecule Thus the atomic orbital’

from diferent atoms must be combined to produce molecular orbitals
Electrons may be considered either as particles or waves An electron it

an atom may therefore be described as occupying an atomic orbital or BY

a wave function w which 1s a solution fo the Schrodinger wave equation

Electrons in a molecule are said to occupy molecular orbitals. The wave

function descnbing a molecular orbnal may be obtamned by one of wo

procedures

1 Linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)

2 United atom method

LCAO METHOD

Consider two atoms A and B which have atomic orbitals described by 18
wave functions Yay and yea) If the electron clouds of these two atonts
‘overlap when the atoms approach then the wave function for the moteculé
(molecular orbital yan) can be obtarned by a linear combanation of the
atomic orbitals Ya 2nd Yay
Yaw = Nleeay + Ym)

‘where V3 a normalizing constant chosen to ensure that the probabiltY
of finding an electron inthe whole of the space 5 unity and cy and ¢; a"
‘constants chosen to give a minimum energy for Wan) If atoms A and B
are similar then e, and c will hve simular values It atoms A and B ae
the same then ¢) and ev are equal

‘The probabihty of finding an electron in a volume of space dv 1s y78”

so the probabilty density for the combination of two atoms as above
related to the wave function squared
