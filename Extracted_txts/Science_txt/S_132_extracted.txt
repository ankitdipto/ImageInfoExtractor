Intercellular Adhesion

Not all physical contacts between cells in a multicellular
organism are fleeting touches. In fact, most cells are in
physical contact with other cells at all times, usually as
members of organized tissues such as those in the lungs,
heart, or gut. These cells and the mass of other cells clus-
tered around them form long-lasting or permanent connec-
tions with each other called cell junctions (figure 7.15).

a tissue in large measure determines what the tissue is like.
Indeed, a tissueâ€™s proper functioning often depends criti-
cally upon how the individual cells are arranged within it.
Just as a house cannot maintain its structure without nails
and cement, so a tissue cannot maintain its characteristic
architecture without the appropriate cell junctions.

 

Cells attach themselves to one another with long-
lasting bonds called cell junctions.
