(If one of the wave functions wpa) is arbitrarily assigned a +ve sign, the
other may be either +ve or —ve.) Wave functions which have the same
sign may be regarded as waves that are in phase, which when combined
add up to give a larger resultant wave. Similarly wave functions of different
signs correspond to waves that are completely out of phase and which
cancel each other by destructive interference. (The signs + and — refer to
signs of the wave functions, which determine their symmetry, and have
nothing to do with electrical charges.) The two combinations are:

Ve) = N(Yay + Veo}
and
Vo) = NWay + [-Yey]} = NOW) — Veo}

The latter equation should be regarded as the summation of the wave
functions and not as the mathematical difference between them.
