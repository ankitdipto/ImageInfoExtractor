Similarly the energy of the antibonding molecular orbital is increased by
A. Atomic orbitals may hold up to two electrons (provided that they have
opposite spins) and the same applies to molecular orbitals. In the case of
two hydrogen atoms combining, there are two electrons to be considered:
one from the 1s orbital of atom A and one from the Is orbital of atom B.
When combined, these two electrons both occupy the bonding molecular
orbital ig). This results in a saving of energy of 2A, which corresponds to
the bond energy: It is only because the system is stabilized in this way that
a bond is formed.

Consider the hypothetical case of two He atoms combining. The Is
orbitals on each He contain two electrons, making a total of four electrons
to put into molecular orbitals. Two of the electrons occupy the bonding
MO, and two occupy the antibonding MO. The stabilization energy 2A
derived from filling the bonding MO is offset by the 2A destabilization
energy from using the antibonding MO. Since overall there.is no saving of
energy, He does not exist, and this situation corresponds to non-bonding.

Some further symbols are necessary to describe the way in which the
atomic orbitals overlap. Overlap of the orbitals along the axis joining the
nuclei produces o molecular orbitals, whilst lateral overlap of atomic
orbitals forms x molecular orbitals.

s~p combinations of orbitals

An s orbital may combine with a p orbital provided that the lobes of the p
orbital are pointing along the axis joining the nuclei. When the lobes which
overlap have the same sign this results in a bonding MO with an increased
electron density between the nuclei. When the overlapping lobes have
