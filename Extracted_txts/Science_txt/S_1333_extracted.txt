‘opposite signs this gives an antibonding MO with a reduced electro
density m between the nuclet (Figure 4 17)

p~pcombinations of orbitals

‘Consider first the combsnation of two p orbitals which both have fobes
pointing along the axis jommng the nuclei Both a bonding MO and at
anuibonding MO are produced (Figure 4 18)

‘Next consider the combination of two p orbitals which both have lobes
perpendicular to the axis joining the nucles Lateral overlap of orbtals malt
