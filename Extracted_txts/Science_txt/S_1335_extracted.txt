penod m the periodic table, for example C=C, C=3N, C==0, C=C and
C=O This s mainly because the atoms are smaller and hence the orbitals
involved are reasonably compact, so tts possible to get substantial overlap
of orbitals There are a smaller number of cases where x bonding occurs
between different types of orbntals, for example the 2p and 3¢ orbitals
Though these orbitals are much larger, the presence of nodes may con
centrate electron density an certain parts of the orbitals

p~d combinations of orbitals

Ap orbital on one atom may overlap with a d orbital on another atom as
shown, giving bonding and antibonding combinations Since the orbitals
do not point along the hine joining the two nuclet, overlap must be of the
type Figure 4 20) This type of bonding 1s responsible for the short bonds
found in the oxides and oxoacids of phosphorus and sulphur. It ako occurs
4m transition metal complexes such as the carbonyls and eyanudes

dd combinations of orbutals

Its posuble to combine two d atone orbitals, producing bonding and
“antibonding MOs which are called 2 and 8° respectively On rotating these
orbitals about the internuclear axts, the sign of the lobes changes four
limes compared with two changes with x overlap and no change for 6
overlap

‘Non bonding combinations of orbitals

All the cases of overlap of atomic orbitals considered so far have resulted
1m a bonding MO of lower energy. and an antibonding MO of higher
energy To obtain a honding MO with « concentration of eleetron density
