When } = 0, the orbitals are symmetrical around the axis and arg

called o orbitals Whea b= £1 they are called x orbitals and whey

d= 42 they are called 8 orbitals
4 The spin quantum number 1s the seme as for atomic orbitals and may

have values of #4

“The Paul exclusion principle states that ut a given atom no two eletrong
can have all four quantum numbers the same The Pauli pnaciple ag
applies to molecular orbitals No nvo elecirons un the same molecule can
‘have al four quantum numbers the same

‘The order of energy of molecular orbwtals has been determined marly
from spectroscopic data In simple homonuclear dratomc molecules, the
order is

[Note that the 2p, atomic orbital gives x bonding and x* antibonding MOs
and the 2p, atomic orbital ves * bonding and x* antibonding MOs. The
‘bonding xp, and x2p, MOs have exacly the same energy and are said to
‘be double degenerate In a sumlar way the antibonding x*2p, and x"2P,
MOs have the same energy and are also doubly degenerate

A sumlar arrangement of MOs exists from a3s to. o"3p,, but the energies
are known with less certanty

‘The energies ofthe o2p and x2p MOs are very close together The order
cof MOs shown above 1s correct for oxygen and heavier elements but forthe
Lighter elements boron, carbon and mtrogen the x2p, and x2p, are probably
lower than o2p, For these atoms the order is

EXAMPLES OF MOLECULAR ORBITAL TREATMENT FOR
HOMONUCLEAR DIATOMIC MOLECULES
In the build up of atoms, electrons are fed into atomic orbitals Ths
Auyfoau poneiple 1s used
1 Orbitals of lowest energy are filled first
2 Each orbital may hold up to two electrons, provided that they have
‘opposite spins.
Honds rule states that when several orbitals have the same energy
(that 2s they are degenerate), electrons wall be arranged so as to give the
‘maximum number of unpatred spins
