Inthe molecular orbital method, we consider the whole molecule rather
than the constituent atoms, and use molecular orbitals rather than atomic
â€˜orbitals, In the build-up of the molecule, the total number of electrons
from all the atoms in the molecule is fed into molecular orbitals. The
Aufbau principle and Hund's rule are used as before.

For simplicity homonuclear diatomic molecules will be examined first.
Homonuclear means that there is only one type of nucleus, that is one
element present, and diatomic means that the molecule is composed of

two atoms.

Hi molecule ion

This may be considered as a combination of a H atom with a H* ion. This
gives one electron in the molecular ion which occupies the lowest energy
MO:

ols'

The electron occupies the als bonding MO. The energy of this ion is thus
lower than that of the constituent atom and ion, by an amount A, so there
is some stabilization. This species exists but it is not common since H, is
much more stable. However. H3 can be detected spectroscopically when

H;, gas under reduced pressure is subjected to an electric discharge-

H, molecule

There is one electron from each atom, and hence there are two electrons
in the molecule. These occupy the lowest energy MO:

ols?

This is shown in Figure 4.23. The bonding ols MO is full, so the stabiliza-
tion energy is 2A. A o bond is formed, and the Hz molecule exists and is
well known.
