"THE COVALENT BOND

 

Het moteculeron

“This may be considered as a combination of a He atom and a He* ton
‘There ace three electrons in the molecular 1on, which are arranged in MOs,

‘The filled cls bonding MO gwes 24 stabshization, whulst the half les
ols" gives A destabilization Overall there 1s stabilization Thus the
helium motecule son can exist It 15 not very stabie, but it has been
‘observed spectroscopically

‘The 2A stabilvzation energy from filing the o2s MO 1s cancelled by the 24

destabsizanon energy fom filing the ols MO Thus @ bond s not
formed, and the molecule does sot exist

Lazmolecute

Each Li atom has two cleetons in is inner shell, and one mn ts outer shel,

and these are arranged in MOs

However, bonding occurs from the filling of the os level, and Lis mol
cules do exist the vapour state. However, i the solid its energetialy
