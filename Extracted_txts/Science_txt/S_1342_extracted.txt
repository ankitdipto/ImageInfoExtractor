This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 4.26. . .
The molecule should be stable, since the two x2p bonding orbitals
Provide 4A of stabilization energy, giving two bonds. In fact carbon exists
as a macromolecule in graphite and diamond, since these are an even more

Stable arrangement (where each carbon forms four bonds): hence diamond
and graphite are formed in preference to C,.
