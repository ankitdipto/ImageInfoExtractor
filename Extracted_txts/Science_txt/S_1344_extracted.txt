This is shown diagrammatically (Figure 4.27). ; ; ;

Assuming that the inner shell does not participate in bonding, and that
the bonding and antibonding 2s levels cancel, one o and two x bonding
pairs remain, giving a total of three bonds. This is in agreement with the
valence bond formulation as N=N.

O, molecule

Each oxygen atom has 2 + 6 = 8 electrons. Thus the O, molecule contains
a total of 16 electrons. These are arranged in MOs:
2 gt]52 g2s2. gt 252 2 f 2275, { x*2py
ols, o* 1s”, 02s”, 0*2s", o2pz, { n2p2, | x*2p!
This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 4.28.

The antibonding x*2p, and x*2p, orbitals are singly occupied in accor-
dance with Hund’s rule. Unpaired electrons give rise to paramagnetism.
Since there are two unpaired electrons with parallel spins, this explains
why dioxygen is paramagnetic. If this treatment is compared with the
Lewis electron pair theory or the valence bond theory, these do not
predict unpaired electrons or paramagnetism.

This was the first success of the molecular orbital theory in successfully
predicting the paramagnetism of O2, a fact not even thought of with a
valence bond representation of O=O.

As in the previous examples, the inner shell does not participate in
bonding and the bonding and antibonding 2s orbitals cancel each other. A
9 bond results from the filling of o2p2. Since x*2p, is half filled and there-
fore cancels half the effect of the completely filled 2p? orbital, half of a x
bond results. Similarly another half of a bond arises from n2p? and
x*2pl, giving a total of 1 + $ + $ = 2 bonds. The bond order is thus two.

Instead of working out the bond order by cancelling the effects of filled
bonding and antibonding MOs, the bond order may be calculated as half
the difference between the number of bonding and entibonding electrons:

( number of electrons ) _ ( number of electrons
Bond = \occupying bonding orbitals in antibonding orbitals
order

In the case of O, the bond order calculates as 10 i
— 6/2 =2,
Corresponds to a double bond. ( ; “nen
