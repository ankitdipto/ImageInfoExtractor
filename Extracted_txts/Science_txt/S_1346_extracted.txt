o bond. The effects of the bonding 2p? and antibonding n2p3 orbitals
cancel, and the completely filled bonding 12p? is half cancelled by the half
filled antibonding x2p!, thus giving half a x bond. The bond order is thus
1 +4 = 15, Alternatively the bond order may be calculated like this:
(bonding — antibonding)/2, that is (10 — 7)/2 = 1}. This corresponds to a
bond that is intermediate in length between a single and a double bond.
The superoxide ion has an unpaired electron and is therefore para-
magnetic. (A bond order of 13 is well accepted in benzene.)

037 ion
Ina similar way sodium peroxide Na2O, contains the peroxide ion Oe.
This ion has 18 electrons, arranged:

2 gts? #962 2 { 72p5, { n* 2p,
ols?, o*1s*, 02s”, 0*2s", o2p2, { x2p2, L x*2p2
Once again the inner shell takes no part in bonding. The bonding and
antibonding 2s orbitals completely cancel each other. One o bond forms
from the filled 2p, orbital. Both the bonding 2p, and 2p, orbitals are
cancelled out by their corresponding antibonding orbitals. Thus the bond
order is one, that is a single bond. Alternatively the bond order may be
calculated as (bonding — antibonding)/2, that is (10 —- 8)/2 = 1.

F, molecule

Fluorine atoms have 2 + 7 electrons, so an F, molecule contains 18 elec-
trons. These are arranged:

2 #952
ols’, of 1s*, 02s?, o*2s?, o2p2, { ™2Py, { ™ 2py
: w2pz, \ n*2p?

This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 4.29.

The inner shell is non-bonding; and the filled bonding 2s, 2p, and 2p,
are cancelled by the equivalent antibonding orbitals. This leaves a o bond
from the filled o2p? orbital, and thus a bond order of one. Alternatively
no neot may be calculated as (bonding — antibonding)/2, that is

- =i.

It should be noted that Cl, and Bry have structures analogous to F2,
except that additional inner shells of electrons are full.

The F—F bond is rather weak (see Chapter 15) and this is attributed to

the small size of fluorine and repulsion between lone pairs of electrons on
adjacent atoms.
