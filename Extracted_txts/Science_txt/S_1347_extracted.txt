Figure 4 29 Electrome configuration, atomic and molecular orbitals for Nuonne

 

1 Only atomic orbitals of about the same energy can combine effectively
2 They should have the manmum overlap
3 They must have the same symmetry

‘Since the two atoms are different, the energies of their atomic orbitals
are shghily different A diagram showing how they comfune to form
‘molecular orbitals 1s given in Figure 4 30
