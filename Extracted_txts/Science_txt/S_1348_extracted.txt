Figure 4.30 The relative energy levels of atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals for
a heteronuclear diatomic molecule AB.

The problem is that in many cases the order of MO energy levels is not
known with certainty. Thus we will consider first some examples where the
two different atoms are close to each other in the periodic table, and
consequently it is reasonable to assume that the order of energies for the
MOs are the same as for homonuclear molecules.

NO molecule

The nitrogen atom has 2 + 5 = 7 electrons, and the oxygen atom has
2 + 6 = 8 electrons, making 15 electrons in the molecule. The order’ of
energy levels of the various MOs are the same as for homonuclear
diatomic molecules heavier than Cy, so the arrangement is:

ols*, o* 1s*, 0252, o*2s?, o2p2, { mp5, { 2p,
” | w2p2, | x*2p2
This is shown in Figure 4.31.

The inner shell is non-bonding. The bonding and antibonding 2s orbitals
cancel, and a o bond is formed by the filled o2p? orbital. A x bond is
formed by the filled 2p? orbital. The half-filled x*2p! half cancels the
filled n2py orbital, thus giving half a bond. The bond order is thus 23,
that isin between a double and a triple bond. Alternatively the bond order
1" be worked out as (bonding — antibonding)/2, that is (10 — 5)/ = 25.
N O (polecute is paramagnetic since it contains an unpaired electron. In

expected. Apart from this the molecular orbital pattern (Figure 4.31)
