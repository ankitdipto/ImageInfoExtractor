Anchoring Junctions

Anchoring junctions mechanically attach the cytoskele-
ton of a cell to the cytoskeletons of other cells or to the
extracellular matrix. They are commonest in tissues sub-
ject to mechanical stress, such as muscle and skin
epithelium.

Cadherin and Intermediate Filaments:
Desmosomes

Anchoring junctions called desmosomes connect the cy-
toskeletons of adjacent cells (figure 7.18), while
hemidesmosomes anchor epithelial cells to a basement
membrane. Proteins called cadherins, most of which are

 

single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins, create the criti-
cal link. A variety of attachment proteins link the short cy-
toplasmic end of a cadherin to the intermediate filaments in
the cytoskeleton. The other end of the cadherin molecule
projects outward from the plasma membrane, joining di-
rectly with a cadherin protruding from an adjacent cell in a
firm handshake binding the cells together.

Connections between proteins tethered to the interme-
diate filaments are much more secure than connections be-
tween free-floating membrane proteins. Proteins are sus-
pended within the membrane by relatively weak
interactions between the nonpolar portions of the protein
and the membrane lipids. It would not take much force to
pull an untethered protein completely out of the mem-
brane, as if pulling an unanchored raft out of the water.
