This is shown in Figure 4.32.

The inner shell is non-bonding, and the bonding and antibonding 2s
orbitals cancel, leaving one o and two 7 bonds — and thus a bond order of
3. Alternatively the bond order may be calculated using the formula
(bonding ~ antibonding)/2, that is (10 — 4)/2 = 3. This simple picture is
not adequate, since if CO is ionized to give CO* by removal of one
electron from the o2p, orbital then the bond order should be reduced to
24 and the bond length increased. In fact the bond length in CO is 1.128A
and in CO* it is 1.115A. Thus the bond length decreases when we
expected it to increase, and it indicates that the electron must have been

removed from an antibonding orbital. The problem remains if we assume
