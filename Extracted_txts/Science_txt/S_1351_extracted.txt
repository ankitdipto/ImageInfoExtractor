the order of energy for the MOs 1s the same as for atoms heavier than C,
since this only reverses the position of the o2py and the (2p, and x2p,)
MOs The most likely explanation of the bond shortening when CO 1s
changed 10 CO" 1s that the o2r and o*2s molecular orbitals differ im
energy more than 1s shown 1n the figure This means that they are wider
‘part, and the o*2s MO is higher in energy than the o2p, 2p, and x2p
‘MOs This illustrates very plainly that the order of MO energy levels for
simple homonuclear diatomic molecules used above 1s not automaticaly
applicable when two different types of atoms are bonded together, ands,
certainly incorrect 1n this particular heteronuclear case

 

HCI molecule

Wah heteronuclear atoms it 1s not obvious which AOs should be combined
by the LCAO method to form MOs In addition because the energy levels
‘of the AOs on the two atoms are not identical. some MOs will contain a
‘rgger coninbution from one AO than the other This equivalent to
saying that the MO ‘bulges more towards one atom. or the electrons nthe
MO spend more time round one atom than the other Thus some degree of
charge separation d+ and 5= occurs resulting ma dipole Thus partial
ronie contnbutions may phy a significant part an the bonding

Consider the HCi molecule Combination between the hydrogen Is AO
and the eblonne 1s, 2s, 2p and 3s orbtals can be ruled out because their
energies are to0 low [overlap occurred between the chlorine 3p, and 3p,
corbials it would be non bonding (sce Figure 4 22) because the postive
lobe of hydrogen will overlap equally with the positive and negative lobes
ofthe chlorine orbitals Thus the only effective overlaps with the chlonne
3p, orbital The combination of H Is! and Cl 3p! guves both bonding and
antibonding orbvtals, and the two electrons occupy the bonding MO,
leaving the antibonding MO empty Its assumed that all the eblorine AOS
‘except 3p, ate localized on the chtonme atom and retain their original AO
status, and the 35, 3p, and 3p, orbitals are regarded as non bonding fone

shown withthe valence bond resonance structures
