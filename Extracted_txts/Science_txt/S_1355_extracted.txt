‘The double bonding sn the structure 1s best explained by means of
delocalized three centre x bonding There 18a total of 18 electrons mn the
valence shell made up of six from each of the three O atoms

‘The central Q atom forms ao bond with each of the other O atoms,
‘which accounts for four electrons The central O atom uses sp* orbitals,
fone of which 1s a fone pair Ifthe ‘end’ O atoms also use sp? atone orbi
tals, each O contains two non bonding pars of electrons ‘Thus fone pairs
account for 10 electrons Sigma bonds and lone pairs together account for
14 electrons, thus leaving four electrons for = bonding,

“The atomte orbitals nvolved in x bonding are the 2p, orbitals on each of
the three O atoms ‘These give nse to three molecular orbitals These are
three centre = molecular orbitals. The lowest energy MO 1s bonding, the
Iughest energy MO ts antibonding, and the middie one 15 non bonding
‘There are four x electrons and two fill the bonding MO and two fil the
non bonding MO, thus contributing one = bond over the molecule. This
gwes a bond order of 1 5 for the O—O bonds The 2 system 15 thus a
four electron three centre bond

Nutnteron NO

‘The mtnte 1on NO 1s V shaped This 1s based on 2 plane triangular
structure, with N at the centre, two corners occupied by O atoms, and
the third corner occupred by a lone pair Thus the N atom 1s roughly sp?
hybndized

In the NO 1on there are 18 electrons un the valence shell These are
‘made up of five from N, s0x from each of the two O atoms, and one from
the charge on the ron

‘The N atom forms o bonds to each of the © atoms, which accounts
for four electrons, and the N atom has a lone paur accounting for two
lectrons If the O atoms also use sp? atomuc orbitals (one for bonding
and two for lone pairs), the lone pairs on the O atoms account for eight
more electrons A total of 14 electrons has been accounted for, leaving
four electrons for x bonding

‘Thice atomic orbitals are involved in x bonding the 2p, orbitals on the
N\ atom and on both of the O atoms These three atomie orbitals form
three molecular orbitals These are three centre x molecular orbitals The
towest in energy 1s bonding, the highest 1s antibonding, and the middle one
's non bonding. Two of the four 7 electtons fill the bonding MO and 1wo
fill the non bonding MO, thus contnbuting one x bond over the molecule
‘The bond order of the N—O bonds 1s thus 1 5, and the N—O distances are
1m between those for a single and double bond

Carbon dioxide CO;

‘The structure of CO, 1s near O—C—O, and the C atom uses sp hybrid
cxbrals for @ bonds Both C—O bonds are the same length, but are much
shorter than asingle bond Thisis best explained by delocahzed x bonding,
