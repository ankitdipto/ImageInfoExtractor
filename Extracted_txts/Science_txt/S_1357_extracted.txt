UNITED ATOM METHOD

‘The LCAO method desenbed above is tantamount to bringing the toms
from infimty to their equilbrum postions in the molecole The unted
atom method 1s an alternate approach It starts with a hypotheucat
‘united atom? where the nucle are superimposed, and then moved 1 the
‘equitiium distance apart. The united atom has the same number of
‘orbitals as 9 normal atom, but st contains the electrons from two atoms
‘Thus some electrons must be promoted to higher energy levels 19 the
