Cadherin and Actin Filaments

Cadherins can also connect the actin frame-
works of cells in cadherin-mediated junc-
tions (figure 7.19). When they do, they form
less stable links between cells than when
they connect intermediate filaments. Many
kinds of actin-linking cadherins occur in dif-
ferent tissues, as well as in the same tissue at
different times. During vertebrate develop-
ment, the migration of neurons in the em-
bryo is associated with changes in the type of
cadherin expressed on their plasma mem-
branes. This suggests that gene-controlled
changes in cadherin expression may provide
the migrating cells with a “roadmap” to their
destination.

Integrin-Mediated Links

Anchoring junctions called adherens junc-
tions are another type of junction that con-
nects the actin filaments of one cell with
those of neighboring cells or with the extra-
cellular matrix (figure 7.20). The linking
proteins in these junctions are members of a
large superfamily of cell surface receptors
called integrins. Each integrin is a trans-
membrane protein composed of two differ-
ent glycoprotein subunits that extend out-
ward from the plasma membrane. Together,
these subunits bind a protein component of
the extracellular matrix, like two hands
clasping a pole. There appear to be many
different kinds of integrin (cell biologists
have identified 20), each with a slightly dif-
ferent shaped “hand.” The exact component
of the matrix that a given cell binds to de-
pends on which combination of integrins
that cell has in its plasma membrane.

Anchoring junctions attach the
cytoskeleton of a cell to the matrix
surrounding the cell, or to the
cytoskeleton of another cell.
