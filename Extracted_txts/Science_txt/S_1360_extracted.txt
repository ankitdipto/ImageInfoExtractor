The metallic bond

 

GENERAL PROPERTIES’OF METALS
All metals have characteristic physical properties:

1. They are exceptionally_good conductors of electricity and heat.

2. They have a characteristic metallic lustre - they are bright, shiny and
highly reflective.

3. They are malleable and ductile.

4. Their crystal structures are almost always cubic close-packed, hexag-
onal close-packed, or body-centred cubic.

5. They form alloys readily.

Conductivity

All metals are exceptionally good conductors of heat and electricity.
Electrical conduction arises by the movement of electrons. This is in
contrast to the movement of ions which is responsible for conduction in
aqueous solution or fused melts of ionic compounds like sodium chloride,
where sodium ions migrate to the cathode, and chloride ions migrate to
the anode. In the solid state, ionic compounds may conduct to a very small
extent (semiconduction) if defects are present in the crystal. There is an

enormous difference in the conductivity between metals and any other
type of solid (Table 5.1).
