"THE METALLIC BOND

 

 

‘Most of the elements to the left of carbon in the periodic table are
metals A carbon atom has four outer electrons If these are all used tg
form four bonds, the outer shell 1s complete and there are no electony
free to conduct electnerty

Elements to the left of carbon have fewer electrons, and so they mut
have vacant orbitals Both the number of electrons present in the outer
‘shell, and the presence of vacant orbitals ithe valence shell, are import
ant features in explaining the conduchvity and bonding of metals

‘The conductwity of metals decreases with increasing temperature
Metals show some degree of pararnagnetism, which indicates that they
possess unpaired electrons

Lustre

Smooth surfaces of metals typically havea lustrous shiny appearance All
metals except copper and gol are svery im colour (Note that when fly
divided most metals appear dull grey oF black ) The shinness rather
Speci and s observed a all vewing angles. in contrast to the shininess of
<few non metallic elements such a sulphur and iodine which appeat shiny
when viewed at low angles Metals are used as mirrors because they reflect
light at llangles Ths 1s because ofthe free electrons in the metal which
absorb energy from light and re-emit when the electron drops back from
is excted sate to ets orginal energy level Since light ofall wavelengths
(colours) is absorbed, and 1s immediately re emited, pracncally all the
Iight 1s relected back’~ hence the lustre ‘The reddish and golden colours
‘of copper and gotd occer because they absorb some colours more rexiy
thin others

Many metals emt electrons when exposed to ight ~ the photoclectne
effet Some emit electrons when irradiated with short wave radiation
snd others ert electrons on heating (thermvontc emssion)

‘Malleabulity and cohesive force

‘The mechanical properties of metals are that they are typically malleable
‘and ductile This shows that there is not much resistance to deformation of
‘the structure but that @ large cohesive force holds the structure together
