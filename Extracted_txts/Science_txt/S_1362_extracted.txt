The cohesive force may be measured as the heat of atomization. Some
numerical values of AH®, the heats of atomization at 25°C, are given in
Table 5.2. The heats of atomization (cohesive energy) decrease on de-
scending a group in the periodic table Li-Na~K-Rb-Cs, showing that
they are inversely proportional to the internuclear distance.

The cohesion energy increases across the periodic table from Group 1 to
Group 2 to Group 13. This suggests that the strength of metallic bonding
is related to the number of valency electrons. The cohesive energy in-
Creases at first on crossing the transition series Sc—Ti-V as the number of
unpaired d electrons increases. Continuing across the transition series the
number of electrons per atom involved in metallic bonding eventually falls,
as the d electrons become paired, reaching a minimum at Zn.
