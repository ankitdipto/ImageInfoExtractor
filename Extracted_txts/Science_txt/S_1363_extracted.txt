‘THE METALLIC BOND 1

energies are much larger than the weak van der Waals forces which hold
discrete covalent molecules together in the solid state

‘There ate two rules about the cohesive energy and structure of metals
{or alloys), and these are examined below

Rule 1 The bonding energy of a metal depends on the aseroge number of
tnpaired electrons available for bonding on each atom

Rule 2 The crystal structure adopted depends on the number of $ and p
orbitals on each atoms that are unvolved with bonding

Consider the frst rule ~ Group 1 metals have the outer electromte con
figuration ns', and so have one electron for bonding In the ground state
(lowest energy), Group 2 elements have the eleetrome configuration ne,
but sf the atom is excited, an outer electron 1s promoted, giving the con
figuration ns', np' with two unparred electrons, which can form two
bonds Simiaily Group 13 elements in the ground state have the con
figuration ns?,np', but when excited to ns, np, they can use three elec
trons for metalic bonding

“The second rule attempts to relate the number of s and p electors
available for bonding to the crystal structure adopted (Table 53) Apart
from Group 1 metas, the atoms need to be excited, and the structures
adopted are shown in Table 5 4

Group 1 elements have a body centred cube structure, and follow the
rule In Group 2, only Be and Mg have a hexagonal close-packed struc
ture and strictly follow the rule In Group 13, Athas a cubic close packed
structure as expected However, not all the predictions are’Gorrect. These
4 no obvious reason why Ca and Sr form cubic elose packed structures
Honever, the high temperature forms of Ca and Sr, and the room tem
Perature form of Ba, form body centred cubsc structures (hike Group 1),
Instead of the expected hexagonal close packed structure The explanation
's probably that the pasted s efectron 1s exested to a d level instead of @p
level and hence there is only one s or p electron per atom participating 9
‘metalic bonding This also explains why the first half of the transition
metals also form body centred cubic structures. In the second half of the
{ransition sees, the extra electrons may be put in the p level 10 avoxd
