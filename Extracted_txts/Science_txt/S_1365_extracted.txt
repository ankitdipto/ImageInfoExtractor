Ceysal structures of metals

Metallic elements usually have a close-packed structare with a coordina
tion number of 12 There are two types of close packing depending on the
arrangement of adjacent layers in the structure cubic close packing
ABCABC and hexagonal close packing ABAB (see Metalic bonds and
metalic structures in Chapter 2) However, some metals have a body-
centred cubic type of structure (whch fils the space slightly less efficent)
where there are eight nearest neighbours, with another six next nearest
neighbours about 15% further away If this small difference in distance
Ddetween nearest and next-nearest neighbours 1s disregarded, the coor
imation number for a body-centred cubic structure may be regarded
loosely as 14 The mechanical properties of malleability and duculty
depend on the ease with which adjacent planes of atoms can glide over
‘each other, to give an equivalent arrangement of spheres These properties
ate also affected by physical mmperfections such as grain boundaries and
dislocations, by point defects in the crystal lattice and by the presence of,
‘races of impumty in the lattice The possibilty of planes gliding is greatest

possible sup planes of close-packed layers an four directions (along the
body diagonals), compared with only one direction in the hexagonal close-

generally softer and more easily deformed than hexagonal or body centred
cubic structures Impunties may cause dislocations in the normal metal
lattice, and the localized bonding increases the hardness. Some soft metals

because they have directional bonds, which pucker layers, preventing one
layer from slipping over another

Metallic elements commonly react with other metallic elements, oftet
