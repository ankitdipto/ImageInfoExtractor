“Bond lengths

If the valence electrons in a metal are spread over a large number of
bonds, each bond should be weaker and hence longer. The alkali metals
exist as diatomic molecules in the vapour state, and the interatomic dis-
tances in the metal crystal are longer than in the diatomic molecule (Table
5.5).

Though the bonds in the metal are longer and weaker, there are many
more of them than in the M2 molecule, so-the total bonding energy is
greater in the metal crystal. This can be seen by comparing the enthalpy
of sublimation of the metal crystal with the enthalpy of dissociation of the
M2 molecules (Table 5.6).

THEORIES OF BONDING IN METALS

The bonding and structures adopted by metals and alloys are less fully
understood than those with ionic and covalent compounds. Any successful
theory of metallic bonding must explain both the bonding between a large
number of identical atoms in a pure metal, and the bonding between
widely different metal atoms in alloys. The theory cannot involve direc-
tional bonds, since most metallic properties remain even when the metal is
in the liquid state (for example mercury), or when dissolved in a suitable
