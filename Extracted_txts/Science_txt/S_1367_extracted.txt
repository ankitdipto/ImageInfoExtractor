theory should explain the great mobility of electrons

Free electron theory

‘Ascatly as 1900, Drude regarded a metal as fathce with electrons moving
through it m much the same way as molecules of a gas are free to move
‘The tdea was refined by Lorentz in 1923, who suggested that metals com-
prised a lattice of rigid spheres (positive 10ns), embedded 1 a g05 of free
valency electrons which could move in the mterstices ‘This model exptains
the fee movement of electrons, and cohesion results from electtostaie
attraction between the positive tons and the electron cloud Whilst it does
‘explain m a rough qualitative way why an increased number of valency
clectrons results in an increased cohesive energy, quanttatwve calculations
are much less successful than similar calculations for the lattice energies of
tonic compounds

 

‘Valence bond theory

Consider a simple metal such as uhm, which has a body-centred eubie
structure, wih eight nearest neighbours and sx next-nearest neighbours a
a slightly greater distance A lithium atom has one electron 1 ts outer
shell, which may be shared with one of ws neighbours, forming @ normal
two electron bond The atom could equally well be bonded to any of ns
other eight neighbours so many different arrangement ate possible, and
Figures 5 la and b are two examples

‘thi atom ay fom two bonds sonzes, and tan then fom
many structures sinar to those in Figures $ 1c and d Pauling suggested
that the tre structure isa muxture of al the many possible bonding forms
‘The more possible structures there are, the lower the energy This means
that the cohesive force which holds the structure together 18 large. and in
secae hthum che cobesive energy as three times greater tha m a Lip
‘molecule The cohesive energy mereases from Group 1 to 2013, and this
's explained by the atoms being able to form an increased number of
bonds, and gwe an even larger number of possible structures The pres
fence of tons could explain the electrical conduction, but the theory does
‘ot explain the conduction of heat n solids or the lustre, or the retention
‘of metalic propertes inthe liquid state oF va solution
