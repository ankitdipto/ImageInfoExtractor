promoting an electron to an unfilled level, where it can move readily. In
the absence of an electric field, equal numbers of electrons will move in all
directions. If a positive electrode is placed at one end, and a negative
electrode at the other, then electrons will move towards the anode much
morc readily than in the opposite direction; hence an electric current flows.

Conduction occurs because the MOs extend over the whole crystal, and
because there is effectively no energy gap between the filled and unfilled
MOs. The absence of an energy gap in lithium is because only half the
MOs in the valence band are filled with electrons (Figure 5.3a).

In beryllium there are two valence electrons, so the valence electrons
Would just fill the 2s valence band of MOs. In an isolated beryllium atom,
the 2s and 2p atomic orbitals differ in energy by 160kJ molâ„¢!. In much the
same way as the 2s AOs form a band of MOs, the 2p AOs form a 2p band
