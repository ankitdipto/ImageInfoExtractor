ALLOYS

When two metals are heated together, or a metal 1s mixed with a non
metallic element then one of the following wall oceur

1 Antonie compound may be formed .
2 Aminterstital alloy may be formed .
3. A substitutional alloy may be formed

4 A simple maxture may sesult .

‘Whneh of These occurs depends om Ye chermca) nature of the wo glemests
concerned and on the relative sizes of the metal atoms and added atoats

Tome compounds

Consider first the chemical nature of the two elements. If an element of
hugh electronegativity (¢ g F 4.0, C130 or O 3 5) 1s added to a metal of
low electronegauty (e g L150, NaO9) the product will be ronie sot

Intersutual alloys and related compounds

‘Next consider the relative sizes of the atoms ‘The structure of many metals

‘many tetrahedral and octahedral holes If the element added has small
