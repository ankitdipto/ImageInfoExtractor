‘the smaller atomMlarger atom should be in the range 0 414-0732. The
invasion of interstitial sites does not significantly alter the metal structure
Iestll looks like a metal, and suill conducts heat and efectneaty However,
filling some of the holes has a considerable effect on the physical pro
perties, particularly the hardness, malleabihty and ductlty of the metal
‘This is because filing holes makes st much more difficult for one layer of
‘metal 1ons to ship over another

Interstizal bondes, carbides and mitrdes are extremely inert chemical,
have very high melting pounts, and are extremely hard Interstitial carbides
