eutectoid composition (a mixture of y-ferrite and iron carbide) is called
pearlite. This is a mixture, not a compound, and is marked P in the dia-
gram. The name pearlite refers to the mother-of-pearl-like appearance
when examined under a microscope. The various solid regions a, y, 6 are
the different allotropic forms of iron and all contain varying amounts of
carbon in interstitial positions.

Steel contains up to 2% carbon. The more carbon present, the harder
and more brittle the alloy. When steel is heated, the solid forms austenite,
which can be hot rolled, bent or pressed into any required shape. On
cooling, the phases separate, and the way in which the cooling is carried
out affects the grain size and the mechanical properties. The properties of
steel can be changed by heat treatment such as annealing and tempering.

Cast iron contains more than 2% carbon. Iron carbide is extremely hard,
and brittle. Heating cast iron does not produce a homogeneous solid
solution (similar to austenite for stéel), so cast iron cannot be worked
mechanically, and the liquid must be cast into the required shape.

Substitutional alloys

If two metals are completely miscible with each other they can form a
continuous range of solid solutions. Examples include Cu/Ni, Cu/Au,
KIRb, K/Cs and Rb/Cs. In cases like these, one atom may replace another
at random in the lattice.

In the Cu/Au case at temperatures above 450°C a disordered structure
exists (Figure 5.7c), but on slow cooling the more ordered superlattice may
be formed (Figure 5.7). Only a few metals form this type of continuous
solid solution, and Hume-Rothery has shown that for complete miscibility
the following three rules should apply.
