1 The two metals must be simular mn size ~ their metalhe rad must not
differ by more than 14-15%

2. Both metals must have the same crystal structure

3 The chemical properties of the metals must be similar ~ an particular the
‘number of valency electrons should be the same

Consider an allay of Cu and Au The metalic radu differ by only 12 5%y
both have cubre close packed structures, and bath have similar propertes
since they are in the same vertical group im the periodic table The to
metals are therefore completely miscible The Group 1 elements sre
chemically simular, and all have body centred cubic structures The size
differences between adjacent pairs of atoms are Li-Na 22 4%, Na-K
220%, K-Rb 9 3% and Rb-Cs 6.9% Because of the size difference,
complete miscibility 1s found with K/Rb and Rb/Cs alloys, but not with
LUNa and Na/K alloys

only one or two of these rules 1s satisfied then random substitution)
solid Solutions wll only occur over a very ited range at the two extremes
‘of composition

Consider alloys of tn and lead The radu difer by only 8 0%, and they
are both an Group 14, and so have similar properties However, thet
structures are different, s0 they are only partly miscible (See Figure 58)
Solder 1s an alloy of Sn and Pb with typically about 30% Sn, but st my
