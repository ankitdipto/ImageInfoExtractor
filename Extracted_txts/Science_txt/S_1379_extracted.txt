‘The relation between the various phases is shown in the phase diagram
(Figure $9) Each phase can be represented by a typical composition or
seal formula even though it exists over 2 range of composition Hume
Rothery studied the compositions of the phases formed and found that the
B phase always occurs in alloys when the ratio of the sum of the valency
electrons to the number of atoms is 3 2 In a sumular way the ¥ phase
always occurs when the ratios 21.13 and the m phase always occurs whed

‘The explanation of why similar bunary metallic phases are formed at
Similar electron to atom ratios 1s not fully understood but seems to hem

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

Metals are good conductors of electnenty and their conductivity utreases

Uungh Onnes discovered that metals such as Hg and Pb became supercon
ductors at temperatures near absolute zero A superconductor has 2er0 05
almost zero electrical resistance It can therefore carry an electne current
wathout fosing energy and in principle the current can flow for ever There

‘Superconduction occurs Later Meissner and Ochsenfeld found that some
