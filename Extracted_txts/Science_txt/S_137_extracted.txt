* Cell signaling is accomplished through the
recognition of signal molecules by target cells.

1, What determines which signal
molecules in the extracellular
environment a cell will respond
to?

2. How do paracrine, endocrine,
and synaptic signaling differ?

7.2 Proteins in the cell and on its surface receive signals from other cells.

* The binding of a signal molecule to an intracellular

receptor usually initiates transcription of specific
regions of DNA, ultimately resulting in the
production of specific proteins.

* Cell surface receptors bind to specific molecules in
the extracellular fluid. In some cases, this binding
causes the receptor to enzymatically alter other
(usually internal) proteins, typically through
phosphorylation.

¢ G proteins behave as intracellular shuttles, moving

from an activated receptor to other areas in the cell.

7.3 Follow the journey of information into the cell.

3. Describe two of the ways in
which intracellular receptors
control cell activities.

4. What structural features are
characteristic of chemically
gated ion channels, and how are
these features related to the
function of the channels?

5. What are G proteins? How
do they participate in cellular
responses mediated by G-
protein-linked receptors?

 

¢ There are usually several amplifying steps between
the binding of a signal molecule to a cell surface
receptor and the response of the cell. These steps
often involve phosphorylation by protein kinases.

6. How does the binding of a
single signal molecule to a cell
surface receptor result in an
amplified response within the
target cell?

7.4 Cell surface proteins mediate cell-cell interactions.

¢ Tight junctions and desmosomes enable cells to
adhere in tight, leakproof sheets, holding the cells
together such that materials cannot pass between
them.

* Gap junctions (in animals) and plasmodesmata (in

plants) permit small substances to pass directly from

cell to cell through special passageways.

7. What are the functions of
tight junctions? What are the
functions of desmosomes and
adherens junctions, and what
proteins are involved in these
junctions?

8, What are the molecular
components that make up gap
junctions? What sorts of
substances can pass through gap
junctions?

9. Where are plasmodesmata
found? What cellular
constituents are found in
plasmodesmata?
