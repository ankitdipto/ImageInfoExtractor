‘a coordination number of 12 sine at 1s surrounded by 12 O atoms, and
the Ti** are surrounded octahedralyy by 6 O atoms This structure x

Superconductivity has also been observed in certain orgame matenals
vith lat molecules stacked on top of each other, and in certaim sulphides
called Chevrel compounds

‘In 1986 Georg Bednorz and Alex Muller (who were working for IBM
Zunch, Switzerland) reported a new type of superconductor wih a T,
Value of 35K This temperature was appreciably higher than that for the
alloys This compound 1s 2 muxed oxide in the Ba-La-Cu-O system

‘This compound has & perovskite structure based on La;CuO, Though
LajCuO, utself 1s non conducting, superconductors can be made by re
placing 7 5-10% of the La™* rons by Ba®* There 1s a small deficiency of

by the reduction of an easily reducible metal cation, n this case Cu”

‘The publication of this paper stimulated enormous snterest mm ‘cera’
superconductors and a flood of papers was published in 1987 Different
laboratones prepared similar compounds, replacing Ba** with Ca?* ot
Se*, substituting different lanthanides,” and varying the preparatwe
conditions to control the amount of oxygen In the main syntheses sot
hometne quantities of the appropriate metal oxndes or carbonates ate
heated in att, cooled, ground, heated in droxygen and annealed Com
pounds were made with T; values of about SOK Bednorz and Moller were
‘svarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1987

Another very significant superconducting system based on the Y-Bs~
v-0 system was reported in March 1987 by Wu, Chu and coworkers
Ths was important because it was the first report of a $y oF
which worked at 93K This ‘temperature was sigafcant for practel
feasons It allows quid arogen (boslng point 77K) to be used as coolat
rather than the more expensive liquid helium ‘The compound 1s forms
Jated as YBa,Cu,0;-, This 1s called the 1-2-3 system because ofthe
‘aio of the metals present Lake the previous La;CuO, system, the 1-2-3
structure contains Cu and 1s based on a perovskite structure Ths com
