floats on a magnetic field has been built n Japan.

Superconductiity of metals and alloys ss thought to involve two elec.
trons at atime (Bardeen etal , 1957, Ogg, 1946) There 1s no one accepted
explanation of how high temperature superconduction ocewts in these
nixed oxide (ceranuc) systems However, 1 seems appropriate to draw
together the apparedt facts at this tme

1 Many, but not all, warm superconductors contaum Cur Two features of
‘Ca chemistry arc that st exsts in three oxidation states, (41), (+11) nd
GeIID, and that Cu(tl) forms many tetragonally distorted octahedral
complexes Bath of these factors may be important In the La;CuO,
compounds some Ba" rons are substituted for La* ‘To bslance the
charges some Cu({l) atoms change into Cu(Ifl). Supereonduetwity
ths system 1s thought to involve the transfer of electrons from CuCl!) 0
Cu(II), but the process involves two electrons as in the metal super-
conductors st could involve electron transfer from Cu(l) to Cu(IM1)

2 Its also significant that these superconductors are all related to the
perovskite sructure

3 Another common feature 1s that the oxygen deficiency seems (0 be
enucal There 1s strong evidence from neutron diffraction that the
vacancies left by mussing © are ordered It seems reasonable to sup-
pose that, since Cu ss normally octahedrally surrounded by sx O
atoms, when an O vacancy occurs (that is when an O 1s omutted), then
two Cu atoms may interact directly with each other Interactions such
3 Ca'!=Cull of Cu'=Cul" could occur by transferring an elec
tron between the two Cu atoms Similarly superconductnty 1 the
‘YBa,Cu,07-, 18 thought to be associated with the ready transfer of
electrons between Cu(I), Cul) and Cu(I)
