SIZE OF ATOMS AND IONS

Site of toms

“The sizeof atoms decreases from left to right across period i the pero
table Forexample on moving from ihium to beryllium one extra postive
charge 8 added to the nucleus, and an extra orbital electron 1s also added
Tnereasing the nuclear charge results 1n all of the orbyal electrons being
pulled closer tothe nucleus Ina gwen period, the alkali metals the largest
tom and the halogen the smallest When a horizontal period contains ten
‘tansiton elements the contraction in swe ts larger, and when mt addition
there are 14 inner transition elements 1m @ horizontal period, the eontac
tuon i stze ws even more marked

On descending a group in the periodic table such as that containing
Jnhium sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium, the sizes ofthe atoms
increase due to'the effect of extra shells of elections being added ths
‘utwerghs the effect of increased nuclear charge

Sue of ions

‘Metals usually form positive rons These are formed by removing one ot
‘ore electrons from the metal atom Metal ions are smaller than the atoms
from which they were formed for two reasons

1 The whole of the outer shell of electrons ts usually toned, 1€
femoved This i one reason why cations are much smaller than the
enigal metal ator

2 A second factor isthe effective nuclear charge In an atom, the aumber
of positive charges on the nucleus 1s exactly the same as the number of
orbital electors. When postive von formed, the number of poste
charges an the nucleus exceeds the number of orbital electrons, and the
effective aucteat charge (which the rato of the numberof charges 09
the nucleus tothe number of eleceons) s mereased Ths reslsin the
remaining elettons being more strongly attract bythe nucle TSS
the clectons are pled in ~ further reducing the su
