“GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS:

{A postive 1on ts always smaller than the corresponding atom snd the
more electrons which are removed (that 1s, the greater the charge on tke
ton), the smaller the 1on becomes

Metalic radius Na 186A Atom rathus Fe 117A
Tome radius Nat 102A Tomeradus Fe 0780 (hgh sa)
Tome rads Fe™* 0 645A (high spn)

When a negative 1on 18 formed, one or more electrons are added to 2
‘atom, the effective nuclear charge 18 reduced and hence the electron cloud
expands Negative tons are bigger than the corresponding stom

Covalent radius Cl 099A

Problems with rome radi

“There are several problems m obtaining an accurate set of one radu

1 Though it possible to measure the internuclear distances n acrysal
very accurately by X ray diffraction, for example the distance between
Na* and Fm NaF, there 1s no” unwersally accepted formula fr
apportioning this to the two rons Historically several different set of
tonic rad have been estimated The main ones are by Goldschmidt
Pauling and Ahrens. These are all calculated from observed mitt
nuclear distances, but difler m the method used to split the distance
between the ions ‘The most recent values, which are probably themes
accurate, ate by Shannon (1976)

2 Caen to these rad re necessary if the charge onthe on 8
changed

3 Corrections must also be made for the coordination number, and the
geometry

4 The assumption that tons are sphenecal xs probably true for ons from
the 5- and p blocks with a noble gas configuration, but 1s probably
untrue for transition metal ions with an sncomplete d shell

5 In some cases there 1s extensive delocalization of d electrons for
‘example in TiO where they give nse to metalle conduction, or in clustet
‘compounds This also changes the rad

 

‘Thus rome radu are not absolute constants, and are best seen as a working
approximation

‘Trends 1m ome rad

Icespective of which set of tonic radu are used, the following trends ate
observed

1 In the main groups, radu ancrease on descending the gr0uP, €8
Lit = 076A, Nat = 102A, K* = 138A, because extra shells
electrons ae added
