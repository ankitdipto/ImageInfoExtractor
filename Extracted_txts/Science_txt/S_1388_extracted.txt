ionic radii decrease moving from left to right across any period in

> the periodic table, e.g. Na* = 1.02A, Mg’* = 0.720A and AP* =

0.535 A. This is partly due to the increased number of charges on the
nucleus, and also to the increasing charge on the ions.

3. The ionic radius decreases as more electrons are ionized off, that is as
the valency increases, e.g. Cr’* = 0.80A (high spin), Cr°* = 0.615 A,
crt = 0.55A, Cr°* = 0.49A and Cro* = 0.44A.

4. The d and f orbitals do not shield the nuclear charge very effectively.
Thus there is a significant reduction in the size of ions just after 10d or
14f electrons have been filled in. The latter is called the lanthanide con-
traction, and results in the sizes of the second and third row transition
elements being almost the same. This is discussed in Chapter 30.

IONIZATION ENERGIES

If a small amount of energy is supplied to an atom, then an electron may
be promoted to a higher energy level, but if the amount of energy supplied
is sufficiently large the electron may be completely removed. The energy
required to remove the most loosely bound electron from an isolated
gaseous atom is called the ionization energy.

Ionization energies are determined from spectra and are measured in
kJmol7!, It is possible to remove more than one electron from most
atoms. The first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the first
electron and convert M to M*; the second ionization energy is the energy
Tequired to remove the’second electron and convert M* to M?*; the third
ionization energy converts M?* to M°*, and so on.

‘The factors that influence the ionization energy are:

1, The size of the atom.

2. The charge on the nucleus.

3. How effectively the inner electron shells screen the nuclear charge.
4. The type of electron involved (s, p, d or f).

, These factors are usually interrelated. In a small atom the electrons are
tightly held, whilst in a larger atom the electrons are less strongly held.
Thus the ionization energy decreases as the size of the atoms increases.
