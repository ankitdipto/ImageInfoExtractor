“Ths trend is shown for example. by Group 1 and Group 2 elements (te
‘Fable 62) and also by the other main groups +

‘Comparison ofthe frst end second yoniatton energies forthe Group |
clements shows that removal of a second electron snvoives a great deal
more energy, between 7 and {4 times more than the first ontation energy
‘Because the second ronvzation energy 1s s0 high. a second electron is sot
removed The large difference between the frst and second ionization
tenerges1s related to the structure of the Group { atoms ‘These atoms have
Jost one electron in their outer shell Whilst ts relavely easy to remove
the single outer electron, i requires much more energy to remove a second
electron, since this involves breaking mito a Bled shell of electrons

“The 1omzation energies for the Group 2 elements show that the fit
sonizatron energy 1 almost daubfe the value forthe corresponding Group {
clement ‘This 8 because the mereased muclear charge results ina salir
suze for the Group 2 element Once the fist electron has been temoved
the ratio of charges on the nucleus to the number of orbital electrons (the
eifecive mucleat charge) 18 increased, and this reduces the size For
‘example, Mg” smaller than the Mg atom Thus the remaining electrons
sn Mg” ate even more ughtly held, and consequently the second onzstion
energy s greater than the frst. Removal ofa third electron from a Grovp
element s very much harder for 180 reasons

1 The effective nuclear charge has mereased, and hence the remaining
electrons are more tightly held

2. Removing another electron would involve breaking a completed shell of
clectrons

 

‘The ronwzation energy also depends on the type of electron which
removed s. p,d and f electrons have orbitals with diferent shapes Ans
‘electron penetrates nearer {0 the nucleus, and 1s therefore more tightly
held than ap electron For simular reasons a p electron 1s more htly held
than ad electron, and a d electoon ws more tightly beld than an f
electron Other factors being equal, thevontzation energies are the ordet

sonization energy for a Group 13 element (wheie'a p electron 1s beng
removed) 1s actually fess than that for the adyacent Group 2 element
(where an s electron is being removed)

In general the tonrzation energy decreases on descending a group and
rmereases on crossing a period Removal of successive elecizons becomes
