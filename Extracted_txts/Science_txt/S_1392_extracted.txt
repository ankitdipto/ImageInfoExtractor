half-filled p shell is left.

In general the first ionization energy decreases in a regular way on
descending the main groups. A departure from this trend occurs in Group
13, where the expected decrease occurs between B and Al, but the values
for the remaining elements Ga, In and TI do not continue the trend, and
are irregular. The reason for the change at Ga is that it is preceded by ten
elements of the first transition series (where the 3d shell is being filled).
This makes Ga smaller than it would otherwise be. A similar effect is
observed with the second and third transition series, and the presence of
the three transition series not only has a marked effect on the values for
Ga, In and TI, but the effect still shows in Groups 14 and 15.

5 The ionization energies of the transition elements are slightly irregular,
ut the third row elements starting at Hf have lower values than would be

expected due to the interpolation of the 14 lanthanide elements between
La and Hf.
