‘The ‘noble behaviour’ of many transition metals, that 1s their resstance
to chemical attack, 1s related to a simular series of energy changes Noble
character is favoured by a high heat of sublimation, high ronrzation energy
‘and Jow enthalpy of solvation of the 1ons

Lattice energies may also provide some information about the sonic!
covalent nature of the bonding_If the lattice energy 18 calculated theoreti
‘ally assuming sonic bonding then the value can be compared with the
experimental value for the lathce energy obtained from the experimentally
‘measused quantities in the Born-Haber cycle Close agreement indieates
that the assumption that bonding 1s rontc x fact true, whilst poor agree
‘ment may indicate that the bonding 1s not wom A’ number of fattce
cenergies are compared in Table 67 The agreement 1s good for all the
compounds isted except for Clz, confirming that these are ionic The
large discrepancy for Clz andicates that the structure 1s not tome, and
fact it forms a layer structure which 1s appreciably covalent

 

POLARIZING POWER AND POLARIZABILITY — FAJANS' RULES

‘Consider making a bond theoretically by bringing two 10ns A* and B
together to their equilbrium distance “Will the bond remain zone, or wilit
become covalent? Tonic and covalent bonding are two extreme types of
bonding, and almost always the bonds formed are intermediate m Yee
and this 1s explained in terms of polarizing (that 1s deforming) the shepe of
the rons

‘The type of bond between A* and B~ depends on the effect one von kas
‘onthe other The positive 1on attracts the electrons on the negative 10n afd
at the same time it repels the nucleus, thus distorting or polarizing the
negative 1on ‘The negative ton wall also polarize the positive 10n, but SE
anjons are usually large, and cations small, the effect of a lasge 108 on
small one will be much less pronounced If the degree of polarization

and a large degcce of covalent character results
