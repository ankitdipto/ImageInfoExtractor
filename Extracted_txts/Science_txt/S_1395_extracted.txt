measure Even worse, a particular type of atom indifferent molecules may
well be in a different environment Its unlikely that the electronegatiaty
fof an atom remains constant regardless of its environment, though its
Invarably assumed that it 1s constant Some of the more important ap-
‘proaches to obtaining electronegatwity values are outlined below

Pauling
Pauling pointed out that since reactions of the type
Az + Bor 2AB
are slmost always exothermic the bond formed between the two atoms

‘Acand B must be stronger than the average of the single bond energies
of A—A and B—B molecules For example

Hagen + Fyn —t 2HF gay SH = ~ $393k not?
Hagan, + Cloigasy % 2HCligany SH = ~1852kI mol
Huge + Bragg > 2HBigay AH = ~727 kot!

 

‘The bonding molecular orbital for AB (qq) ts made up from contr
‘butions from the wave functions for the appropriate atomuc orbitals (Yq
and Yo)

an = (a) + constant (Ys)

Ifthe constant 1s greater than 1. the molecular orbital 1s concentrated on
the B atom. whuck therefore acquutes a partial negative charge and the
bond ss partly polar

AB
Conversely if the constant 1s fess than 1 “atom A gains a partial negative
charge Because of ths partial onic character the A—B bond sstronger

than would be expected for a pure covalent bond The extra bond energy s
called delta

AA = (actual bond energy) ~ (energy for 100% covalent bond)

‘The bond energy can be measured but the energy of a 100% covalent
bond must be calculated Pauling suggested the 100% covalent bond
energy be calculated as the the geometric mean of the covalent energies of
AA and BB molecules

 

we e santana = VEx—a Ens)
‘The bond energy in AA and B—B molecules can be measuted and so
‘A = (actual bond energy) ~ Ena Eine)

Pauling states that the electronegativity difference between two atoms 5
equal to 0.20870 where A is the extra bond energy in kealmal™’
