(Converting the equation to SI units gives 0.1017/A, where A is measured
in kJmol7'.)

Pauling evaluated 0.208/A for a number of bonds and called this the
clectronegativity difference between A and B. Repeating Pauling’s cal-
culation with SI units for energy, we can evaluate 0.1017/A:

OO

 

Bond A(kJ mol7!) 0.1017V~A

C-H 24.3 0.50 ie. xC — yH = 0.50
H—Cl 102.3 1.02 i.e. xCl — yH = 1.02
N-H 105.9 1.04 ie. yN — yH = 1.04

 

(x (chi) = electronegativity of atom)

If yH = 0 then the electronegativity values for C, Cl and N would be 0.50,
1,02 and 1.04 respectively. Pauling changed the origin of the scale from xH
= 010 7H = 2.05 to avoid having any negative values in the table of values,
and this made the value for C become 2.5 and the value for F become 4.0.
At the same time the values for a number of other elements approximated
to whole numbers: Li = 1.0, B = 2.0, N = 3.0. Thus by adding 2.05 to the
values calculated in this way we can obtain the usually accepted
electronegativity values (Table 6.8).

Iftwo atoms have similar electronegativities, that is a similar tendency to
attract electrons, the bond between them will be predominantly covalent.
Conversely a large difference in electronegativity leads to a bond with a
high degree of polar character, that is a bond that is predominantly ionic.

Rather than have two extreme forms of bond (ionic and covalent),
Pauling introduced the idea that the ionic character of a bond varies with

common oxidation states of the elements)
