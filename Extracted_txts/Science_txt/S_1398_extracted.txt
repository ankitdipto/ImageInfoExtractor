the difference in electronegativity as shown in Figure 6.3. This graph is
based on the ionic characters HI 4% ionic, HBr 11%, HCl 19% and HF
45%, which are known from dipole measurements. Fifty per cent ionic
character occurs when the electronegativity difference between the atoms
is about 1.7, so for a larger difference than this a bond is more ionic than
covalent. Similarly, if the electronegativity difference is less than 1.7, the
bond is more covalent than ionic. It is better to describe a bond such as one
of those in BF; as 63% ionic, rather than just ionic.

Mulliken

In 1934, Mulliken suggested an alternative approach to electronegativity
based on the ionization energy and electron affinity of an atom. Consider
two atoms A and B. If an electron is transferred from A to B, forming ions
A* and B™, then the energy change is the ionization energy of atom A (J)
minus the electron affinity of atom B (Eg), that is /, — Eg. Alternatively,
if the electron was transferred the other way to give B* and A7 ions, then
the energy change would be Jg — E,. If A* and B™~ are-actually formed,
then this process Tequires less energy, and

(Ia — Ep) < Up ~ Ea)
Rearranging

(Ua + Ea) < (lp + Ep)
ba Mulliken Suggested that electronegativity could be regarded as the
‘age of the ionization energy and the electron affinity of an atom.
