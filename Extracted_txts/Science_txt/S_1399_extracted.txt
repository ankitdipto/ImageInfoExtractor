En kimol~! The energy 1eV/motecule = 96 48KI mot", so the
commonly accepted Pauling values are more neatly obtained by perform
ing this caleulation (7 + E)/(2 x 28 x 96 48) or (1 + EY/S40

“This method has a simple theoretical basis, and also has the advantage
that different values can be obtained for different oxidation states ofthe
same element It suffers from the limitation that only a few electron
affiniues are known ss more usval f0 use the approach based on bond
energies

Allred and Rochow

11958 Aliced and Rochow considered clectronegatiity ina different nay
and worked out values for 69 elements (See Further Reading ) They

electron at a distance equat to the covatent radius This force F x

by screening factors for the orbital electrons The screening factors vary
depending on the principal quantum number (the shell that the electron

‘The electronegatwvity values so obtained agree quite closely with thse
obtained by Pauling and Mulliken

‘As the oxidation number of an atom increases, the attraction for the
electrons increases, so the electronegatwity should also increase. Allied
