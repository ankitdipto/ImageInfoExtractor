‘GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS: 7

 

(Oxides which are insoluble m water eannot produce OH™ in ths way and
these are regarded as baste if they react with acids to form salts Thus nthe
‘main groups of the periodic table, basic properties increase on descending
‘a group because the elements become more electropositive and more onic
However, this generalization does not hold for the d block, and part
ularly forthe central groups of transition elements (Cr, Ma Fe, Co Ni)
‘where basicity and the ability to form simple rons decreases on descending
the group

‘The degree of electropositwity 1s shown 1n a vanety of ways Strongly
electropositve elements react with water and acids They form strongly
basic oxides and hydroxides, and they react with oxoacids to ave stable
salts such as carbonates, nitrates and sulphates Weakly clectroposine
elements are unaffected by water and are much less readily attacked by
acids Their oxides are frequently amphotene and react with both acids
and alkalss They are not basic enough to form stable carbonates

‘The electropositive nature of a metal 1s also shown in the degree of
hydranon of the 1ons In the change M* to {(H,O), > MJ" the posrnve
charge becomes spread over the whole complex tom Since the charge 1
ro Jonger localized on the metal, this 1s almost the same as the change
M? > M_ Strongly electropositve metals have a great tendency to the
‘opposite change, M+ M~ so that they are not readily hydrated The les
electropostive the metal the weaker the tendency M > M"* and the
stronger the degree of hydration ‘Thus the elements in Group 2 are less
electropositive than those of Group 1, and Group 2 1ons are more heavily
hydrated than those in Group 1 The degree of hydration also decreases
down a group, eg MgCl; GH,O and BaCly 2,0

Salts of stongly electropostive metals have litle tendency to hydrolyse
‘nd form oxosalts Since the metal ions large, st has litte tendency to form
‘complexes On the other hand, salts of weakly electropositve elements
‘bydrolyse and may form oxosalts Because they are smaller, the metal ors
hhave a greater tendency to form complenes

VARIABLE VALENCY AND OXIDATION STATES

In the s block the oxidation state 1s always the same as the group number
Forp block elements, the oxidation state 1s normaly (the group number ~
10) or (18 ~ the group number) Variable valency does occur toa lrited
‘extent m the p-block In these cases the oxidation state always changes by
two, ¢ g TICls and TICI, SnCly and SaCly, PCIe and PCh, and s due 08
pur of electrons remaming paired and not taking part yn bonding (the wert
patreffect) The term oxidation state 1s preferred to valency The oxsdation
state may be defined 2s the charge left on the central atom when all the
other atoms of the compound have been removed 1 thete usual oxdstion
sates Thus TI shows oxidation states of (+111) and (+1), Sn of (+1V) and
G+), and P of (4V) and (+111) The oxidation number can be caleulsted
equally well for 1onie or covalent compounds and without knowing the
