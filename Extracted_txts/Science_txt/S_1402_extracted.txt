follows. O usually has an oxidation state of (-I}) (except in O2 and 037).
Husually has an oxidation state of (+1) (except in Hz and H~). The sum of
the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in H)SO, is zero, so:

(2 x 1) + (S*) + (4x -2) =0

Thus x, the oxidation state of S, is (+ VI). In the case of the oxidation state
of Mn in KMnOg, the compound ionizes into K* and MnOj ions. In
MnO; the sum of the oxidation states is equal to the charge on the ion, so:

Mn* + (4 x -2) = -1

Thus x, the oxidation state of Mn, is 7, i.e. (+ VII).

One of the most striking features of the transition elements is that the

elements usually exist in several different oxidation states. Furthermore,
the oxidation states change in units of 1, e.g. Fe** and Fe?*, Cu* and
Cu’. This is in contrast to the s-block and p-block elements. The reason
why this occurs is that a different number of d electrons may take part in
bonding.

Though the oxidation number is the same as the charge on the ion for

ions such as TI* and TI°*, the two are not necessarily the same. Thus Mn
exists in the oxidation state (+I) but Mn7* does not exist, as KMnO,
ionizes into K* and MnO;z.

When a metal is immersed in water, or a solution containing its own ions,
the metal tends to lose positive metal ions into the solution. Thus the metal
acquires a negative charge.
