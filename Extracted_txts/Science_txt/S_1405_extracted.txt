In general redox couples are written oxired where ox 1s the oxidized form

‘Standard reduction potential values are determined relative to a

Subtracting equation (6 2) from (6 1) gives

Both of the standard potentials are relative to the H*/H couple and
therefore H* and Hy disappear when the Cu?*/Cu couple s combined wath
