1. The noble metals (with E° more positive than 0V).

2. Metals which are easily reduced (e.g. with coke) (E° 0 — (—0.5) V).

3. Typically reactive transition metals (E° (—0.5) — (—1.5) V) which are
often prepared by reduction with electropositive metals.

4, The electropositive metals (E° more negative than —1.5 V) which can
be prepared by electrochemical reduction.

When a solution is electrolysed the externally applied potential must
overcome the electrode potential. The minimum voltage necessary to
cause deposition is equal and opposite in sign to the potential between the
solution and the electrode. Elements low down in the series discharge first;
thus Cu?* discharges before H*, so copper may be electrolysed in aqueous
solution. However, hydrogen and other gases often require a considerably
higher voltage than the theoretical potential before they discharge. For
hydrogen, this extra or over-voltage may be 0.8 volts, and thus it is possible
to electrolyse zinc salts in aqueous solution.

Several factors affect the value of the standard potential. The conversion
of M to M* in aqueous solution may be considered in a series of steps:

1, sublimation of a solid metal
2. ionization of a gaseous metal atom
3. hydration of a gaseous ion

These are best considered in a Born—Haber type of cycle (Figure 6.4).

The enthalpy of sublimation and the ionization energy are positive since
energy must be put into the system, and the enthalpy of hydration is
negative since energy is evolved. Thus
