170 ‘GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS —

Consider first a transition metal Most transition metals have high
melting points hence the enthalpy ot sublimation is high Simiatly they
ace favly small atoms and have high sonrzation energies ‘Thus the value for
the electrode potential Es low, and the metal has tle tendency to form
tons hence if 1s unreactive or noble.

Tn contrast the s block metals (Groups 1 and 2) have low melting ponts
(hence fow enthalpies of sublimation), and the atoms are farge and there-
fore have low tontzation energies Thus the electrode potential & 1s high
and the metals are reactive

Electrons are lost when a substance ts oxidized and electrons are gained
when iis reduced A reducing agent must therefore supply electrons, and
elements having large negative electrode potentials are strong reducing
agents The strengths of oxxhaing and reducing agents may be measured by
the size of the potential between a solution and an inert electrode
Standard reduction potentials are obtained when the concentrations of
‘oxidized and reduced forms are 1M, and the potential developed 1s meas
tured against a standard hydrogen electrode ‘The most powerful oxtd:ang
agents have 2 large positive oxidation potential and strong reducing agents
have a large negative potential Standard oxidation potentials allow us 0
predict which tons shouk! oxidize or reduce other 1ons. The potentials
indicate ifthe energy changes for the process are favourable or unfavour-
able Itisumportant to realize that though the potentials may suggest thota
reaction is possible, they do not give any kinetic snformation concerning
the rate of the reaction ‘The rate of the reaction may be very fast or slow,
and in some cases a catalyst may be required for it to occur at all ~ for
‘example in the oxidation of sodium arsemite by cen sulphate

 

OXIDATION-REDUCTION REACTIONS

Oxidation i the removal of electrons from an stom, and reduction the
addition of electrons to an atom The standard electrode potential vent
Table 610 are written by convention with the oxidized species on the lft
and the reduced species on the right

Onidation-reduction (redox) potentrals can be used to great advantage
