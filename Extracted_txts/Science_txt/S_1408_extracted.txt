application of thermodynamics. Ultimately whether a reaction occurs or
not depends on energy. A reaction will not proceed if the free energy
change AG is positive, and thus thermodynamics saves us the trouble
of trying the reaction. If AG is negative, then the reaction is thermo-
dynamically possible. It does not follow that because a reaction is thermo-
dynamically possible, it will necessarily occur. Thermodynamics does not
give any information on the-rate of a reaction, which may be fast, slow,
or infinitely slow, nor does it indicate if another reaction is even more
favourable.

Consider the corrosion that may occur when a sheet of galvanized iron is
scratched. (Galvanized iron is iron which has been coated with zinc to
prevent rusting.) Half reactions and the corresponding reduction potentials
are shown below.

Fe*t +2e— Fe  E° = —0.44 volts
Zn** + 2e+> Zn E° = —0.76 volts

When in contact with water, either metal might be oxidized and lose metal
ions, so we require the reverse reactions, and the potentials for these are
called oxidation potentials, and have the same magnitude but the opposite
sign to the reduction potentials.

Fe + Fe** +2e  E° = +0.44 volts
Zn— Zn?* +2e EE? = +0.76 volts

Plainly, since Zn > Zn?* produces the largest positive E° value, and since
AG = —nFE?, it will produce the largest negative AG value. Thus it is
energetically more favourable for the Zn to dissolve, and hence the Zn will
corrode away in preference to the Fe.

It is possible that when the galvanized steel is scratched, the air may
oxidize some iron. The Fe** so produced is immediately reduced to iron by
the zinc, and tusting does not occur.

Zn + Fe?* — Fe + Zn?+

Similar applications in which one metal is sacrificed to protect another are
the attaching of sacrificial blocks of magnesium to underground steel
Pipelines and the hulls of ships to prevent the rusting of iron.

Thus the Coating of zinc serves two purposes — first it covers the iron and
Prevents its oxidation (rather like a coat of paint) and second it provides
anodic protection.

A table of standard reduction potentials (Table 6.12) may be used to
Predict if a reaction is possible, and what the equilibrium constant will be.
Consider for example if the triiodide ion Ty will oxidize As(III) in
atsenious acid HAsO, into As(V).

HAsO, + Ij + 2H,O + H3AsO, + 317 + 2H*

finee the table lists reduction potentials, we must find the half reactions for
bAsO. + 2e— products, and I; + 2e > products,
