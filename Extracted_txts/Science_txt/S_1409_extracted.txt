‘The reaction we are investigating requires the first half reacuon in the
reverse dusection, added to the second half reaction E° values for hal
reactions must not be added together, since they do not take account of th
‘number of electrons involved However, £° values may be converted tothe
‘corresponding AG values which may be added to give AG for the overall
reaction

“The AG free energy change so calculated s postive, which indcatesthat
the reaction will not proceed spontancously in the forward direction, ad
suggests that 11s energetically feasible for the reaction to proceed inthe
reverse direction It should be noted that the value of AG 1s very sma
and thus sts unwise to draw very firm conclusions The E* values relate to
standard conditions, and since AG 1s small, a small change in conditions
such as varying the concentration, or the pH, or the temperature, could
change the potentials and hence change AG sufficiently to make the
reaction proceed in either direction ‘There are volumetric methods of

‘THE USE OF REDUCTION POTENTIALS

Enormous use may be made of reduetion potentials for surnmanmng wht
species wall oxdize or reduce something else, what the products of he
reaction will be, and what oxidation states are stable wit respect to i
solvent, and also with respect to disproportionation Thus topics oft
1msuffcintly understood, so a number of examples are given

A great deal of useful information about an element canbe shown by te
appropnate half reactions and reduction potentials Consider some hal
reactions involving ison
