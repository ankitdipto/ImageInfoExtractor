The potential for the reduction of FeQ37 to Fe3* is +2.20 volts. Since
AG = ~nFE®, it follows that SG for this change will be large and
negative. This means that the reaction is thermodynamically possible since
it releases a large amount of energy, and FeQ37 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Standard electrode potentials are measured on a scale with

Ht +e>~H E° = 0.00 volts

Since hydrogen is normally regarded as a reducing agent, reactions with
negative value for E° are more strongly reducing than hydrogen, that is
they are strongly reducing. Materials which are generally accepted as
oxidizing agents have E° values above +0.8 volts, those such as Fe?*
Fe?* of about 0.8 volts are stable (equally oxidizing and reducing), and
those below +0.8 volts become increasingly reducing.

For the change Fe**/Fe?*, E° is +0.77 V. This is close to the value of
0.8V, and therefore Fe** and Fe** are of almost equal stability with
respect to oxidation and reduction. The E° values for the changes Fe® —>
Fe and for Fe’* —» Fe are both negative: hence AG is positive, so neither
Fe** nor Fe** have any tendency to reduce to Fe.

One of the most important facts which can be obtained from a reduction
potential diagram is whether any of the oxidation states are unstable with
Tegard to disproportionation. Disproportionation is where one oxidation
state decomposes, forming some ions in a higher oxidation state, and some
in a lower oxidation state. This happens when a given oxidation state is a
stronger oxidizing agent than the next highest oxidation state, and this
Situation occurs when a reduction potential on the right is more positive
than one on the left. In the diagram of iron reduction potentials, the values
become progressively more negative on moving from left to right, and
hence Fe’ "and Fe?* are stable with respect to disproportionation.

At first sight the potential of —0.057 V for Fe?* —> Fe seems wrong since
the Potentials for Fe** > Fe?* and Fe?* —» Fe are 0.77V and —0.47V
Tespectively, and adding 0.77 and ~0.47 does not give —0.057. Potentials
