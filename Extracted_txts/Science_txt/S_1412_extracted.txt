water to O2, whilst strong reducing agents will reduce it to Hp. Thus very
strong oxidizing or reducing agents can not exist in aqueous solution. The
following half reactions are of special importance:

Reduction of water ,
neutral solution H,0 +e~~ OH™ + 4H, E° = -0.414V

 

1.0M acid solution H30* +e” > H,0 + 4H, 0.000 V
1.0M base solution H,O +e~— OH™ + 3H, 0.828 V
Oxidation of water

neutral solution 40, + 2H* + 2e7 + H,O E° = +0.185V
1.0M acid solution 40, + 2H* + 2e7 + H,O = +1.229V

 

1.0M base solution 40, + H,O + 2e7 ~ 20H™ E°= +0.401V

‘These reactions limit the thermodynamic stability of any species in aqueous
solution.

Thus the minimum reduction potentials required to oxidize water to
dioxygen is E° > +0,185 V in neutral solution, E° > +1.229V in 1.0M
acid solution and E° > +0.401 V in 1.0M basic solution.

In the same way half reactions with E° potentials less than zero (that is.
negative values) should reduce water to H2 in 1.0M acid solution, whilst an
E° < ~0.414 V is required in neutral solution, and E° < —0.828 V in 1.0M
basic solution.

Often when the E° values are just large enough to suggest that a reaction
is thermodynamically possible, we find that it does not appear to happen.
It must be remembered that a substance may be thermodynamically un-
stable, but kinetically stable, since the activation energy for the reaction
is high. This means that the rates of these reactions are very slow. If the
potentials are appreciably more positive or negative than these limits then
Teaction with the solvent is usually observed. :

The potential for the couple AmO ->» Am** can be calculated by
converting the values of 0.86 and 2.62 volts into free energies, adding
them, then converting back to give a potential of 1.74 volts. When this step
is added to the diagram it becomes apparent that the potentials do not
decrease from AmO3* to AMO} to Am**, and hence AmO} is unstable
with regard to disproportionation to AmO3* and Am**. Finally, the
Potential for the couple AmO3* — Am** can be worked out to be +1.726
volts. Thus considering AmO3* > Am** — Am, Am** is stable:
