tas important to include all the possible half reacuons in a reduction
potential diagram, or incorrect conclusions may be drawn Examination of
the incomplete diagram for chlorine in baste solution would indicate that

Reduction potential diagrams may also be used to predict the products
‘of reactions in which the elements have several oxidation states Consider
for example the reaction between an acidified solution of KMnO. and KI
