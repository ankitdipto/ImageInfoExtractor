* Disproportionates

If we assume that the reactions are thermodynamically controlled, that is
equilibrium is reached fairly quickly, then since MnO37, Mn** and HOI
disproportionate, they need not be considered. The half reaction Mn?* >
Mn has a large negative E° value, and hence AG will have a large positive
value, so this will not occur, and can be ignored. Thus the reduction
potential diagrams may be simplified:

If the reaction is carried out by adding KI solution dropwise to an
acidified solution of KMnO,, the products of the reaction must be stable in
the presence of KMnO,. Thus Mn?* cannot be formed, since KMnO,
would oxidize it to MnQy. In a similar way, Ip cannot be formed, since
KMnO, would oxidize it. The fact that the half reaction potentials for
10; > 103 and HsI0¢—> 103 are close to the MnOz > MnO, potential is
a complication, and it is not obvious whether IO; 107 or HsIOg will be
the product. In fact I~ is oxidized to a mixture of IO; and IO;.

2MnO;z + I7 + 2H* > 2MnO, + IOZ + HO
8MnO; + 317 + 8H* — 8MnO, + 3107 + 4H2O
If the feaction is carried out in a different way, by adding the KMnO,
dropwise to the KI solution, then the products formed must be stable in the

Presence of I~. Thus MnO, cannot be formed, since it would oxidize I~ to

1,. Similarly, TOs cannot be formed since it would oxidize any excess I~ to
1,, The reaction which takes place is

2MnO, + 1017 + 16H* > 2Mn?* + 51, + 8H,0
