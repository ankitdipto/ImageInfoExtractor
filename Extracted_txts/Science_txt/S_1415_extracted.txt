“JHE OCCURRENCE AND ISOLATION OF THE ELEMENTS,

‘The most abundant elements in the earth s crust (by weight) are shown in
‘Table 6 13 111s worth noting that the first five elements compnse almost
92% by weight of the earth s erust_ that the fist ten make up over 99 5%
and the frst twenty make up 99.97% Thus 3 few elements are very
abundant but most ofthe elements are very scarce
