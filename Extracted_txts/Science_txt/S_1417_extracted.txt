Ni-with CO at 50°C Any mmpunties in the Nt sample remain solid and
the gas is heated to 230°C, when it decomposes to give pure metal and

ppuntying nickel which was used an South Wales from 1899 unt the
19605. A new plant im Canada uses the same principle but uses 150°C
and 20 atmospheres pressure to form Ni(CO),

Boer process has been vsed to puny small quantities of 2seconium and
boron The impure element 1s heated with 1odine, producing a volatile
todide Zrly or Bl; These are decomposed by passing the gas over an
electrically heated filament of tungsten or tantalum which ss white hot
‘The element 1s deposited on the filament and the 1odine s recycled The
filament grows fatter, and 1s eventually removed: The tungsten core s
dalled out of the centre, and a small amount of high punty Zr or Bs
