 

THE OCCURRENCE AND ISOLATION OF THE ELEMENTS

applicable to elements which react with water, and to be economic must
involve sacrificing a cheap element to obtain a more expensive element.

1. Copper ores which are too lean in CuS for the Cu to be extracted by
roasting in air are left to be weathered by air and rain to form a solution
of CuSO,. The Cu?* ions are displaced as Cu metal by sacrificing scrap
iron which turns into Fe?* because iron is above copper in the electro-
chemical series.

Fe + Cu*+ > Fe?* + Cu

2. Cadmium occurs in small amounts with zinc ores. The Zn is recovered
by electrolysing a solution of ZnSO, which contains traces of CdSO,.
After a time the amount of Cd?* has concentrated, and since Zn is
above Cd in the electrochemical series some Zn metal is sacrificed to
displace the Cd?* from solution as Cd metal. The Zn which was
sacrificed is subsequently recovered by electrolysis.

Zn + Cd?* — Zn?* + Cd

3. Sea water contains Br~ ions. Chlorine is above bromine in the
electrochemical series, and bromine is obtained by passing chlorine into
sea water.

Ch + 2Br~ > 2CI- + Bry

High temperature chemical reduction methods

A large number of commercial processes come into this group. Carbon can
be used to reduce a number of oxides and other compounds, and
because of the low cost and availability of coke this method is widely
used, The disadvantages are that a high temperature is needed, which is
expensive and necessitates the use of a blast furnace, and many metals
combine with carbon, forming carbides. Some examples are:
