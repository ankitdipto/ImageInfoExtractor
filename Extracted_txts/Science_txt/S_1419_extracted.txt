Reduction by another metal

If the temperature needed for carbon to reduce an oxide 15 t00 high for
‘economic oF practical purposes, the reduction may be effected by another
highly electropostive metal such es aluminium, which hberates a lage
amount of energy (1675kJ mol™!) on oxidation to AlOy ‘Ths 1s the bass
of the Thermite process

IMmO, + BAL 9M + 40105
BuO, + Al-+2B + ALO:
CO + AL='2Cr + ALOy

‘Magnesium 1s used ina similar way to reduce oxides In certain cases where
the oxide 1s too stable to reduce, electropositive metals are used to reduce
fades .

Self reduction

‘A cumber of metals occur as sulphide ores (for example PbS, CuS and
Sb.S\) which may be rossted first n ait fo partially convert them to the
‘oxide and then further roasted in the absence of arr, causing self
reduction

‘This method isnot widely used, because many metals react wth hydroget

at elevated temperatures, forming hydndes “There 1s also a risk of e5°

Electrolyte reduction

‘The strongest possible reducing agent 1s an electron Any yonte materi!
may be electgolysed “and reduction occurs at the eathode This af &*
