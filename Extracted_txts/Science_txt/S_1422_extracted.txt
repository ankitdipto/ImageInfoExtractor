Figure 6.5 Ellingham diagram showing the change in free energy AG with tem-
perature for oxides (based on 1 gmol of dioxygen in each case).

common reactant (in this case dioxygen) is used may be plotted graphically
against temperature for a number of reactions of metals to their oxides.
This graph is shown in Figure 6.5 and is called an Ellingham diagram (for
oxides). Similar diagrams can be produced for one gram molecule of
wena. giving an Ellingham diagram for sulphides, and similarly for
ides,
The Ellingham diagram for oxides shows several important features:

1. The graphs for metal to metal oxide all slope upwards, because the free
orerey change increases with an increase of temperature as discussed
above.

. The free energy changes all follow a straight line unless the materials
melt or vaporize, when there is a large change in entropy associated
with the change of state, which changes the slope of the line (for

example the He—HgO line changes slope at 356°C when Hg boils, and
similarly Me-MgO changes at 1120°C). . J“
