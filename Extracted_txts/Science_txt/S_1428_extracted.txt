PROBLEMS

1. (a) How does the size of atoms vary from left to right in a period, and
On descending a group in the periodic table? What are the reasons
for these changes?

(b) Can you explain the large atomic radii of the noble gases?
(c) Why is the decrease in size between Li and Be much greater than
that between Na and Mg or K and Ca?

2. Explain what is meant by the ionization energy of an element. How
does this vary between hydrogen and neon in the periodic table?

Discuss how the variation can be related to the electronic structure of
the atoms.

- (a) What is the correlation between atomic size and ionization
energy?
(b) Account for the fact that there is a decrease in first ionization
energy from Be to B, and Mg to Al.
(c) Suggest the reason for the decrease in first ionizat
N to O. and P to S.

(d) Explain why the substantial decrease in first ionization energy

ion energy from
