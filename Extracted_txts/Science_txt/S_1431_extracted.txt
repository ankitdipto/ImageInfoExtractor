DOUBLE SALTS AND COORDINATION COMPOUNDS

Suidiuon compounds are formed when stoichiometric amounts of two
‘OF more stable compounds jon together For example

KCl + MpCl; + 6,0 KCI MgCi, 61,0
(carallite)
KS8Ox + Al{SO4)s +2410 K350, AL($0,), 2410
(potassium alum)

CuSO4 + ANH, + HO CuS0,-4NH- H,0
(tetrammine copper(tt) sulphate
monohydrate)

Fe(CN): + 4KCN —+ Fe(CN), 4KCN
(potassium ferrocyamide)

Addition compounds are of two types

2 Those which ose ther sdentty insolation (double salts)
2 Those which retain their identity wn soloen (complexes)
