Aifferent somene complexes of a system as was possible He noted the
umber of isomers formed and related this number to the number of
tsomers predicted for different geometric shapes The most common co-
fordination number 1n transition metal complexes 1s 6, and the shape
usually octahedral The coordination number 4 1s also common, and ths
fives nse to either tetrahedral or square planar complexes

‘Werner treated cold solutions ofa series of coordination complexes with
‘an excess of silver mitrate, and weighed the silver chlonde precipitated
‘The stoichiomettes of complex—AgCl formed were as follows

CoCh 6NHy > 3AgCL
CoCl, SNH; —» 2AgCl
CoCl; 4NHy—> 1AgC)

Werner deduced that in CoCl, 6NH3 the three chlories acted
as primary valencies and the six ammomias as secondary valeneres
In modern terms the complex 1s written [Co(NHy)sJCh_The three CI” are
tonic and hence are precipitated as AgC! by AgNOy ‘The six NHs ligands
form coordinate bonds to Co'* forming a complex 10n (Co(NH3)]”
(Figure 7 1a)

‘Werner deduced that foss of one NH3 from CoCls 6NHs should ave
CoC SNH, and at the same time one Cl changed from being 2 pr
mary valency to a secondary valency Thus this complex had to primary
valencies and six secondary valencies In modern terms the complet
[Co(NH,),CI}CI, 1omzes to gre [Co(NHs)sCI}** and two CI” rons Thos
‘only two of the three chlonne atoms are rome and thus only two att
preciprtated as AgCI with AgNO3 Five NHy and one Cl form coordinate
bonds to Co, forming a complex 1on (Figure 7 1b)

Similarly in CoCh 4NH, Werner deduced that one Cl formed a primary
valency, and that there were six secondary valencies (two Cl and fost
NH) In modern terms the complex [Co(NH,),Ch]CI ronrzes to pe
{Co(VH,),Ci,]* and CI~ and so only one CI” can be precipitated as AgCl
‘The coordination number of Co™ 1s 6, an thi case four NH and 190 CI~
form coordinate bonds to Co™* The old and modern ways of wnting the
formulae of these complexes are shown 1n Table 7 1

‘Thus Werner established that the number of secondary valences (that's
the coordination number) was 61n these complexes. He then attempied 0
