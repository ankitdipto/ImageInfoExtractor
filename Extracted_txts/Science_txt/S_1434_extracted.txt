find the shapes of the complexes. The possible arrangements of six groups
round one atom are a planar hexagon, a trigonal prism, and an octahedron
(Figure 7.2). Werner then compared the number of isomeric forms he had
obtained with the theoretical number for each of the possible shapes
(Table 7.2).

{[MX.Y3] 2 2 3 3

 

These results strongly suggested that these complexes have an
octahedral shape. This proof was not absolute proof, as it was just possible
that the correct experimental conditions had not been found for preparing
all the isomers. More recently the X-ray structures have been determined,
and these establish that the shape is octahedral (Figure 7.3).
