In a similar way, Werner studied a range of complexes which mtuded
[Pt"(NHy)2Ch} and [Pa""(NHY),Cha] The coordination number i ¢, and
the shape could be either fetrahedral or square planar Werner was able to
prepare two different somers for these complexes A tetrahedral complex
can only exrst in one form. but a square planar complex can exist n tho
‘somenc forms ‘This proved these complexes are square planar rather than
tetrahedral (Figure 7 5)
