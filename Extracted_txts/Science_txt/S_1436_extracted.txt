ments, shown in Table 7.4.

The freezing point of a liquid is lowered when a chemical substance is
dissolved in it. Cryoscopic measurements involve measuring how much the
freezing point is lowered. The depression of freezing point obtained de-
pends on the number of particles present. Cryoscopic measurements can
be used to find if a:molecule dissociates, and how many ions are formed. If
a molecule dissociates into two ions it will give twice the expected
depression for a single particle. If three ions are formed this will give three
times the expected depression. Thus:

Lic] sLi* +Cl7 (2 particles) [(2 charges)
MgCl, —> Mg?* + 2CI~ (3 particles) | (4 charges)
LaCl,— La** +3CI” (4 particles) [ (6 charges)

The number of particles formed from a complex molecule determines the
size of the depression of freezing point. Note that the number of particles
formed may be different from the total number of charges which can be
obtained from conductivity measurements. The two types of information
can be used together to establish the structure (Table 7.5).

The magnetic moment can be measured (see Chapter 18 — Magnetic
Properties). This provides information about the number of unpaired elec-
tron spins present in a complex. From this it is possible to decide how the
electrons are arranged and which orbitals are occupied.’ Sometimes the
structure of the complex can be deduced from this. For example, the
compound Ni'(NH,)s(NO3)3-2H2O might contain four ammonia mol-
