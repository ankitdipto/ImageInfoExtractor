SHAPES OF d ORBITALS

Since d orbitals are often used in coordination complexes it is important
to study their shapes and distribution in space. The five d orbitals are not
identical and the orbitals may be divided into two sets. The three log
orbitals have identical shape and point between the axes, x, y and z. The
