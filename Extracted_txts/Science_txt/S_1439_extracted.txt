BONDING IN TRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES

‘There are three theories of metal to ligand bonding in complexes, al dating
back to the 1930s

Valence bond theory

“This theory was developed by Pauling Coordination compounds cotta
complex sons, m which ligands form coordinate bonds to the metal This
the ligand must have a fone pate of electrons, and the metal must have at
‘emply orkital of suitable energy avaiable for bonding The theory son
saders which atomic orbitals on the metal are used for bonding. From tis
the shape and stability of the complex are predicted The theory has 2
‘main himitations Most transition metal complexes are coloured, but tht
theory provides no explanation for their electronic spectra Further,
‘theory does not explain why the magnene properties vary with tempt
ture. For these reasons it has largely been superseded by the erystal eld
theory However, it1s of interest for study ast shows the continuity of he
development of modern ideas from Werner's theory

Ceystal Feld theory

‘This theory was proposed by Bethe and van Vieck ‘The attraction between
the central metal and ligands in the complex is considered to be pte
electrostatic Thus bonding im the complex may be wonton atta
