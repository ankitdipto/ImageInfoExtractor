obtained by other approaches using symmetry and group theory.

VALENCE BOND THEORY

The formation of a complex may be considered as a series of hypothetical
steps. First the appropriate metal ion is taken, e.g. Co>*. A Co atom has
the outer electronic structure 3d74s?. Thus a Co®* ion will have the
structure 3d°, and the electrons will be arranged:

full 3d 4s 4p 4d
= O OO CT

If this ion forms a complex with six ligands, then six empty atomic orbitals
are required on the metal ion to receive the coordinated lone pairs of
electrons. The orbitals used are the 4s, three 4p and two 4d. These are
hybridized to give a set of six equivalent sp*d? hybrid orbitals. A ligand
orbital containing a lone pair of electrons forms a coordinate bond by
overlapping with an empty hybrid orbital on the metal ion. In this way a
bond is formed with each ligand. The d orbitals used are the 4d,2_,2
and 4d,2. In the diagrams below, electron pairs from the ligands are shown
as tN}.

Since the outer 4d orbitals are used for bonding this is called an outer
orbital complex. The energy of these orbitals is quite high, so that the
complex will be reactive or labile. The magnetic moment depends on the
number of unpaired electrons. The 3d level contains the maximum number
of unpaired electrons for a d® arrangement, so this is sometimes called a
high-spin or a spin-free complex. An alternative octahedral arrangement is
Possible when the electrons on the metal ion are rearranged as shown
below. As before, lone pairs from the ligands are shown as ‘Yj .
