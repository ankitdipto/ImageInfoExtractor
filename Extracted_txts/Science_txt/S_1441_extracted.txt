f_COORPINATIO

‘Since Tow energy nner dhorbitals are used this 1s called an snner orbs!
‘complex Such complexes are more stable than the outer orbual com
plexes. The unpaired electrons in the metal ion have been forced o par
‘up and so this 1s now a Tow spin complex. In this particular case all he
clectrons are paired so the complex will be diamagnetic

‘The metal 1on could also form four coordinate complexes and two dit
ferent arrangements are possible Jt must be remembered thar hybnd
‘orbitals do not actually exist Hybridization 1s a mathematical manipulation
of the wave equations for the atomic orbrals involved

‘The theory does not explain the colour and spectra of complexes The
theory shows the number of unpaired electrons From ths the magnet

why the magnetic moment varies with temperature

CRYSTAL FIELD THEORY

‘The crystal feld theory 1s now much more wadely accepted than the valente
‘bond theory It assumes that the attraction between the central metal ard
the ligands m a complex, purely electrostatic ‘The transition metal which
forms the central atom’m the complex 1s regarded as 2 posite 108 of
charge equal to the oxidation state This is surrounded by negative hgands
or neutral molecules which have 2 lone patr of electrons If the ligands
Aeutral molecule such as NH, the negative end of the dipole m the
molecule 1s directed towards the metal ion. The electrons on the cet
metal are under repulsive forces from those on the ligands Thus the
electrons occupy the d orbitals furthest away from the direction of 2p

‘proach of ligands In the crystal field theory the following assumptions
‘te made

 

1 Ligands are treated as pomt charges

2 There ts no anteraction between metal orbitals and ligand orbitals

3. The d orbitals on the metal all have the same energy (that as degenerate)
tn the free atom However, when a complex is formed the ligands
destroy the degeneracy of these orbitals re the orbitals now have
