the ¢, orbitals are +0 6A, above the average level, and the fg orbitals ae
044, below the average (Figure 79)

‘The swe of the energy gap Ay between the tz and ¢, levels can be
measured easily by recording the UV-visible spectrum of the complex
Consider a complex ike [Ti(H,0),)* ‘The TH 10n has one d electron In
the complex this will occupy the orbrtal with the lowest energy, that ote
