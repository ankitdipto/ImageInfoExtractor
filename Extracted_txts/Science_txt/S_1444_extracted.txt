Figure 7.11 Ultraviolet and visible absorption spectrum of (Ti(H,0),*.

for [Ti(H2O)}** is 20300/83.7 = 243 kJ mol™!. This is much the same as
the energy of many normal single bonds (see Appendix F).

The above method is the most convenient way of measuring A, values.
However, A, values can also be obtained from values of observed lattice
energies and those calculated using the Born—Landé equation (see
Chapter 3).

Solutions containing the hydrated Ti®* ion are reddish violet coloured.
This is because yellow and green light are absorbed to excite the elec-
tron. Thus the transmitted light is the complementary colour red—violet
(Table 7.7).

Because of the crystal field splitting of d orbitals, the single d electron in
[Ti(H,0)}>* occupies an energy level 2/5A, below the average energy of
the d orbitals. As a result the complex is more stable. The crystal field
stabilization energy (CFSE) is in this case 2/5 x 243 = 97kJ mol™!.
