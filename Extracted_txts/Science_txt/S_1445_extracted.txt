‘The magnitude of A, depends on three factors

1. The nature of the ligands

2. The charge on the metal 10n

3. Whether the metal 1s i the first, second or third row of
elements

Examination of the spectra of a sens of complexes of the same metal
wath different ligands shows that the position of the absorption band (and
hence the value of A.) varies depending on the higends which are attached
(Table 78)

Ligands which cause only a small degree of crystal fcld sphiting re
termed weak field higands Ligands which cause a large splitting are called
strong field ligands Most A values are m the range 7000cm™! 10
30000cm™! The common ligands can be arranged un ascending order of
‘crystal field sphtting A ‘The order remains practically constant for diffrest
metals, and thos series 1s called the spectrochemical sens (see Furthtt
