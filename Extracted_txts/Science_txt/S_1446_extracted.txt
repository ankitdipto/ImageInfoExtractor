Values for d‘ and d? are approximate because of tetragonal distortion.

For first row transition metal ions, the values of A, for M** complexes are
roughly 50% larger than the values for M?* complexes (Table 7.9).

The value of A, also increases by about 30% between adjacent members
down a group of transition elements (Table 7.10). The crystal field stabiliz-
ation energy in [Ti(H2O)¢]°*, which has a d! configuration, has previously
been shown to be —0.4A,. In a similar way, complexes containing a metal
ion with a d? configuration will have a CFSE of 2 x —0.4A, = —0.8A, by
singly filling two of the fg, orbitals. (This is in agreement with Hund’s rule
that the arrangement with the maximum number of unpaired electrons
is the most stable.) Complexes of d> metal ions have a CFSE of 3 x
-0.4A, = -1.2A,.

Complexes with a metal ion with a d* configuration would be expected
to have an electronic arrangement in accordance with Hund’s rule (Figure
7.12a) with four unpaired electrons, and the CFSE will be (3 x -0.4A,) +
(0.6A,) = —0.6Ay. An alternative arrangement of electrons which does
not comply with Hund’s rule is shown in Figure 7.12b. This arrangement
has two unpaired electrons, and the CFSE is (4 x -0.4A,) = -1.6A,.
The CFSE is larger than in the previous case. However, the energy P used
to pair the electrons must be allowed for, so the total stabilization energy is
~1.64, + P. These two arrangements differ in the number of unpaired
electrons, The one with the most unpaired electrons is called ‘high-spin’ or
spin-free’, and the other one the ‘low-spin’ or ‘spin-paired’ arrangement.
Both arrangements have been found to exist. Which arrangement occurs
for any particular complex depends on whether the energy to promote an
