CFSE which snereases the thermodynamic stabiity of the complexes
‘Thus many transition metal compounds have a higher measured fatice
‘energy (obtained by calculations using the terms inthe Born—Haber eye}
than is calculated using the Born~Lande Born—Meyer or Kapustisti
equations In contrast the measured (Born~Haber) and calculated values

4° configuration and a weak field ligand. hence there s no CFSE
