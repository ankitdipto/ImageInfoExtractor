‘TETRAGONAL DISTORTION OF OCTAHEDRAL COMPLEXES
(AHN-TELLER DISTORTION)

“The shape of transtion metal complexes is determmned by the tendency of
electron p urs to occups positions as far away from each other as possible
This 16 the sume as for the main group compounds and complexes It
addition the shapes of transom metal complexes are affected tv whethet
the d orbitals are symmetrically or asvmmetnicalls filled .

Repuluon by sy ligands in an octahedral complex splits the d orbital
fn the central metal into f and ¢, tevels. Ie follows that there #2

All other arrangements have an asymmetncal arrangement of de
