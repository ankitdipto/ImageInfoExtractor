as closely as others. The e, orbitals point directly at the ligands. Thus

asymmetric filling of the e, orbitals results in some ligands being repelled
more than others. This causes a significant distortion of the octahedral
shape. In contrast the f2, orbitals do not point directly at the ligands, but
point in between the ligand directions. Thus asymmetric filling of the to,
orbitals has only a very small effect on the stereochemistry. Distortion
caused by asymmetric filling of the f2, orbitals is usually too small to
measure. The electronic arrangements which will produce a large distor-
tion are shown in Table 7.15.

The two e, orbitals d,:_,2 and d.: are normally degénerate. However, if
they are asymmetrically filled then this degeneracy is destroyed, and the
two orbitals are no longer equal in energy. If the d: orbital contains one
