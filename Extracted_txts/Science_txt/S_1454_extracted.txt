detected. However, distortions resulting from uneven filling of the e,
orbitals are very important.

Figure 7.17 a* arrangement in very strong octahedral field. Tetragonal distortion
splits (a) the e, level; and (b) also splits the tag level. The ayy orbital is higher in
energy than the d,. or d,.. (For simplicity this is sometimes ignored.)

SQUARE PLANAR ARRANGEMENTS,

If the central metal ion in a complex has a d® configuration, six electrons
will occupy the hog orbitals and two electrons will occupy the e, orbitals.
‘The arrangement is the same in a complex with weak field ligands. The
electrons are arranged as shown in Figure 7.16. The orbitals are symmetri-

cally filled, and a regular octahedral complex i:
N sat plex is formed, for example b
{Ni"(H,0),°* and IN#"(NH)62*- “
