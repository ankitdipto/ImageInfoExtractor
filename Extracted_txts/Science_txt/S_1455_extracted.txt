‘The single electron inthe dj:_ye orbutal 1s being repelled by four hands
whilst the electron in the d,s orbital rs only being repelled by two ligands
“Thus the energy of the dye sncreases relative to that of dj Ifthe ind
field 1s suffrently strong, the difference in energy between these ty
forbitals becomes larger than the energy needed to patr the electrons
Under these conditions, a more stable atrangement anses when both thee,
electrons pair up and occupy the lower energy ds orbital This leaves the
dys orbital empty (Figure 7 17) Thus four ligands can now approach
along the +x, “x, +y and ~y directions without any difficulty a the
djz-ys orbital is emipty However, ligands approaching along the +: ast
= directions meet very strong repulsive forces from the fled dy oral

‘The amount of tetragonal distortion that occurs depends on the par
tucular metal ran and ligands Sometimes the tetragonal distortion may
become so large thatthe d, orbital lower n energy than the dy orbalas
