Square planar structures can also arise from d* ions in a weak ligand
field. In this case the d.2 orbital only contains one electron.

TETRAHEDRAL COMPLEXES

A regular tetrahedron is related to a cube. One atom is at the centre of the
cube, and four of the eight corners of the cube are occupied by ligands as
shown-in Figure 7.20.

The directions x, y and z point to the centres of the faces of the cube.
The e, orbitals point along x, y and z (that is to the centres of the faces).
The t2, orbitals point between x, y and z (that is towards the centres of the
edges of the cube) (Figure 7.21).

The direction of approach of the ligands does not coincide exactly with
