Figure 7.23 Energy levels for d orbitals in a tetrahedral field.

The CFSE in both octahedral and tetrahedral environments is given in
Table 7.17. This shows that for d?, d5 and d!0 arrangements the CFSE is
zero in both octahedral and tetrahedral complexes. For all other electronic
arrangements there is some CFSE, and the octahedral CFSE is greater
than the tetrahedral CFSE. It follows that octahedral complexes are
generally mote stable and more common than tetrahedral complexes. This
is partly because there are six bond energy terms rather than four, and
partly because there is a larger CFSE term. Despite this some tetrahedral

complexes are formed, and are stable. Tetrahedral complexes are favoured: .

1. Where the ligands are large and bulky and could cause crowding in an
octahedral complex.

2. Where attainment of a regular shape is important. For tetrahedral
Structures d°, d?, d5, d7 and d'@ configurations are regular. Some tetra-
om ees which are regular are: Ti!¥Cl, (9, 4), [Mn¥"0,]-
Ce» fag), (FeO? (c2, 18,), [FeCl] (2, 8 » (ColCLP~ (e4, #3,
and T2nt'ci,je~ (ef, 1), 8, a] « Bi 2p) { a} (€ 2g)

3. When. the ligands are weak field, and the loss in CFSE is thus less
important.

4. Where the central metal has a low oxidation state. This reduces the
magnitude of A. .

5. Where the electronic configuration of the central metal is d°, d5 or d!°
as there is no CFSE.

6. Wheré the loss of CFSE is small, e.g. d' and d® where the loss in CFSE
8 0.134, or d? and d? where the loss is 0.27A,,
