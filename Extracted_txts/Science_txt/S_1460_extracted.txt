In this complex the copper is surrounded by four —NH) groups. Thus each
ethylenediamine molecule is bonded to the copper in two places. For this
reason ethylenediamine is called a bidentate group or ligand. (Bidentate
means literally two teeth!) A ring structure is thus formed (in this case a
pair of five-membered rings) and such ring structures are called chelates.
(Chelos is the Greek word for crab.) Chelated complexes are more stable
than similar complexes with unidentate ligands, as dissociation of the
complex involves breaking two bonds rather than one. Some common
polydentate ligands are listed in Figure 7.24.

The more rings that are formed, the more stable the complex is. Chelat-
ing agents with three, four and six donor atoms are known and are termed
tridentate, tetradentate and hexadentate ligands. An important example of
the latter is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. This bonds through two N
and four O atoms to the metal, and so forms five rings. Due to this
