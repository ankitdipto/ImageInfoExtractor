MAGNETISM

The magnetic moment can be measured using a Gouy balance (see Chapter
18). If we assume that the magnetic moment arises entirely from unpaired
electron spins then the ‘spin only’ formula can be used to estimate n,
the number of unpaired electrons. This gives reasonable agreement for
complexes of the first row of transition metals.

Hs = Yn(n + 2)

Once the number of unpaired electrons is known, either the valence bond
or. the crystal field theory can be used to work out the shape of the
complex, the oxidation state of the metal, and, for octahedral complexes,
whether inner, or outer d orbitals are used. For example, Co(+III) forms
many complexes, all of which are octahedral. Most of them are diamagne-
tic, but [CoF,]*~ is paramagnetic with an observed magnetic moment of
5.3.BM. Crystal field theory explains this (Figure 7.27).

Co(+I1) forms both tetrahedral and square planar four-coordinate com-
plexes. These can be distinguished by magnetic measurements (Figure
7.28).

However, orbital angular momentum also contributes to a greater or
lesser degree to the magnetic moment. For the second and third row
transition elements not only is this contribution significant, but spin orbit
coupling may occur. Because of this, the ‘spin only’ approximation is no
longer valid, and there is extensive temperature-dependent paramagne-
tism. Thus the simple interpretation of magnetic moments in terms of the
number of unpaired electrons cannot be extended from the first Tow of
