FATENSION OF THE CRYSTAL FIELD THEORY TO ALLOW
FOR SOME COVALENCY

JRe,CTsa itd theory s based on purely electrostatic attraction AL fist
{28M ths seems to be'a most improbable assumption Nevevieloos, he
thea fematkably successful explaining the shapes of eomplves
the spectta and there magnetic properties Calculstomeon becore doa
thar seeey, The disadvantage of the theory 1s that it ignores emdence

at SOME covalent bonding does occur im atleast some encanen seal
complexes

" Kompounds in the zero oxidation state such as nickel cabonl

RECO) hve no elecrosane attraction betwen the metal ad he
ligands Thos the bonding mast be covalent

2? The order af igands in the spectzocheraeal sens cannot bbe explained
solely on electrostatic grounds
