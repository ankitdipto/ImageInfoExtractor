spin resonance that there is some unpaired electron density on the
ligands. This suggests the sharing of electrons, and hence some
covalency.

The Racah interelectron repulsion parameter B is introduced into the
interpretation of spectra. This makes some allowance for covalency arising
from the delocalization of d electrons from the metal onto the ligand. If B
is reduced below the value for a free metal ion, the d electrons are
delocalized onto the ligand. The more B is reduced the greater the delo-
calization and the greater the amount of covalency. In a similar way an
electron delocalization factor k can be used in interpreting magnetic
measurements.

MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY

The molecular orbital theory incorporates covalent bonding. Consider a
first row transition element forming an octahedral complex, for example
