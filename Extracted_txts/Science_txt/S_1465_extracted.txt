[co"(NHy)"* The atomic orbitals on Co" which are used to mate
molecular orbitals are 34, « 3di 43, 4P4. 4p, and 4p, A 2p atoms
‘orbital from each NHy containmg @ lone patt 1s also used to mate
molecular orbitals Thus there are 12 atomic orbitals, which combine t9
five 12 molecular orbitals (sx bonding MOs and six antibonding MOs)
‘The 12 electrons fcom the sx igand Tone parrs are placed in the sx bonding
MOs This accounts for the six bonds The transition metal Co'” has ater
d orbitals, which have so far been ignored These are the 3d,y,3dy and
43d, orbutals These form non bonding MOs, and in Co™* they contain sx
electrons, but contribute nothing to the bonding The antibonding MOs
areall empty The arrangement is shown in Figure 7 29 We would pret
that the complex should be diamagnetic as ali the electrons are pared Tee
complex should be coloured since promotion of electrons from the nen
bonding MOs to the antibonding ef MOs 1s fedsible The energy jump &,
1523000em™" ‘The six non bonding d electrons are paired in ths complet
because A, 1s larger than the painng energy of 19000em""
‘A similar MO chagram can be drawn for the complex {Col"f]'
