NOMENCLATURE OF COORDINATION COMPOUNDS

‘The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) pot
‘cation Nomenclature of Inorganic Cherustry (3989), Blackwell Sagnilé
Publishers, contams the rules for the systematic naming of coord?

compounds ‘The baste rules are summarzed here

1 The positive 1on 1s named first followed by the negative 100

2 When writing the name of a complex, the ligands are quoted
alphabetical order, regardless of ther charge (followed by the met)

3. When weting the formula of complexes, the complex ion should beet
closed by square brackets The metal is named first, them the cord
ated groups are listed m the order negative ligands, neutral ligand
positive ligands (and alphabetically according to the first syrabol wit!®

each group)

(a) The names of negative ligands end in -o, for example

F fvoro HH hydndo
Cr ettoro — OH™ hydroxo
Br bromo O* oxo

1 1edo OF peroxo:

Hs~
sé

ar
NOx

-mercapto
thio
cyano

(0) Neutral groups have no spectal endings Examples melude Ni
ammine HO aqua, CO carbonyl and NO nitrosyl The hgands
‘and Op ate called dinitrogen and dioxygen Organic igands 3
usually gwen their common names, for example phenyl met
ethylenediamine, pyridine, tnphenylphosphine

{©) Postive groups end in. rum, ¢ ¢ NH;—NH; hydrazinwum

4 Where there are severat ligands of the same kind, we normally use
prefixes di, tn tetra, penta and hexa to show the number of Hands
