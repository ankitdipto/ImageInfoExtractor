of AgBr with AgNOs, thus confirming the presence of free Br7 ions. Note
that the sulphate ion occupies only one coordination position even though
it has two negative charges. Other examples of ionization isomerism are
[Pt(NH3)4Cl,]Br2 and [Pt(NH3),BrzJCh, and [Co(en),NO,-CIJSCN,
[Co(en),NO2-SCNJCI and [Co(en),C] - SCN]NO>.

Hydrate isomerism

Three isomers of CrCl;-6H2O are known. From conductivity measure-
ments and quantitative precipitation of the ionized chlorine, they have
been given the following formulae:

[Cr(H20),]Cl; violet (three ionic chlorines)
[Cr(H20)5Cl]Cl, - HzO green (two ionic chlorines)
[Cr(H20),Cl,]-Cl-2H,O dark green —(one ionic chlorine)

Linkage isomerism

Certain ligands contain more than one atom which could donate an elec-
tron pair. In the NO ion, either N or O atoms could act as the electron
pair donor. Thus there is the possibility of isomerism. Two different
complexes [Co(NH3)sNO2]Cl, have been prepared, each containing the
NOz group in the complex ion. One is red and is easily decomposed by acids
to give nitrous acid. It contains Co—ONO and is a nitrito complex. The
other complex is yellow and is stable to acids. It contains the Co—NO,
group and is a nitro compound. The two materials are represented in Figure
7.32. This type of isomerism also occurs with other ligands such as SCN~.

Coordination isomerism

When both the Positive and negative ions are complex ions, isomerism may
ee caused by the interchange of ligands between the anion and cation, for
' xample [Co(NH5),][Cr(CN),] and [Cr(NH5)6][Co(CN).]. Intermediate
'ypes between these extremes are also possible.
