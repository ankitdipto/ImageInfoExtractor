‘Coordination position somerism

In polynuclear complexes an interchange of ligands between the diferes
metal nucle gives nse to positional isomerism An example s gvea

‘Geometric somensm or stercoisomensm

In disubstituted complexes, the substituted groups may be adjacent o
opposite to each other This gives nse to geometric somensm Thus ‘qu
planar complexes such as (Pt(NH),Ci,} can be prepared in two forms cr
and trans If the complex 1s prepared by adding NH,OH to a solutond!
[PICl}™ tons, the complex has a finite dipole moment and must theeoe
be cas The complex prepared by treating (Pt(NH),]** with HCl has
dipole, and must therefore be trans ‘The two complexes are shonn
