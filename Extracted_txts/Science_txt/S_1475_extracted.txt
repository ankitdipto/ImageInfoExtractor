Why are d-d electron transivons forbidden” Why ate they weakly
absorbing and why do they occur at all?

Why are compounds of Ti** and Zn?* typically whnte? Why are Ma?*
compounds very pale m cotour? What dd tcansitions are spin allowed
for a d® ton?

‘What 1s the spectrochemucal series, and what 1s its smportance?

Gwen that the maximum absorption mn the d-d peak for [T4(H,0)4*
occurs at 20300cm"!, predict where the peaks will occur for
