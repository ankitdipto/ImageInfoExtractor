ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE

Hydrogen tas the simplest atone structure of all the elements, ad
consists of 4 nucleus containing one proton with a charge +1 and one
orbital electron The electronic structure may be written as is! Atoms of
hydrogen may attain stability in thee diferent ways

1 By formuag an electron paur (covalent) bond with another atom
Nonemetals typically form this type of ond with hydrogen, or example
Hy HzO, HCl, or CHg, and many metals do so too

2 BY losing an electron to form H*

‘A proton is extremely small (radwus approximately 1 5 x 10°%A, com
pared wath 7414 A for hydrogen, and 1~2A for most atoms) Beste
11" isso small, s has a very hugh polarng power, and thereto
distons the electron cloud on other atoms “Ths protons ar als
associated with other atoms or malecules For example, in wat! F
aqueous solutions of HCI and #1SO,, protons exist as HyO*, H,OZ or
HQHLO}s ions Free protons do ot exist onder ‘normal condons',
though they re found in low pressure gaseous beams, for example @2
mass spectrometer

3 By goinmng an electron to form H~
CCoystalie solids such a6 La contain the H™ 10n and are formed bY
highly electropositive metals (all of Group 1, and some of GrovP 2)
However, H™ tons are uncommon

Since hydrogen has an electronegatiity of 2 1, at may use any of the
three methods, but the most common way 1s forming covalent bonds

POSITION IN THE PERIODIC TABLE

Liyerogen isthe fist element m the periodic table, and vs unique Rete
are only two elements in the frst period. hydrogen and helium Hydro80
1s quite reactive, but helium is inert There 1s no difficulty relating the
sinieture and properties of helium to those of the other noble gases
