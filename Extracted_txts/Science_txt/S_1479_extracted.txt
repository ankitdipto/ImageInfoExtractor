Its diffictt to obtain pure He from water gas, since CO 1s difficult to
remove The CO may be liquified at alow temperature under pressure,
thus separating it from H Alternatively the gas mixture can be mited
‘with steam, cooled to 400°C and passed over iron oxide in a shit
converter, pring Hz and CO; The CO so formed 1s easly removed
ether by dissolving in water under pressure, or reacting with KyCO;
solution, giving KHCOs, and thus giving H gas

2. Hydrogen 1s also made m farge amounts by the steam reformer
process The hydrogen produced a this way 1s used in the Hater
process to make NHs, and for hardening o1's Light hydrocarbons such
as methane are mixed with steam and passed over a nickel cataljt at
'800~-900°C. These hydrocarbons are present in natural gas, and are aso
produced at oil refinenes when ‘eracking” hydrocarbons

‘The gas emerging from the reformer contatns CO, COs, Hy and exces
steam The gas mixture ts mixed with more steam, cooted to 400‘C and
passed into a shift converter ‘This contamns an sron/copper catalyst and
‘CO 1s converted nto CO;

Finally the COs 18 absorbed in a solution of K3CO, or ethanofamne

3 Imo refinenes, natural hydrocarbon moxtutes of high molecular weight
such as naphtha and fuel orf are ‘cracked! to produce lower mofeculat
weight hydrocarbons which can be used as petrol Hydrogen 1s 2 ald

4 Very pure hydrogen (99 9% pure) 1s made by electrolysis of watel oF
solutions of NaOH or KOH This s the most expensive method Water
does not conduct electroty very well, so it 15 usual to electtolye
aqueous solutions of NaOH or KOH in a cell with nickel anodes and
