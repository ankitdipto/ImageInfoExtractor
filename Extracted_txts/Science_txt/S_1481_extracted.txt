HYDROGEN AND THE HYDRIDES 1

 

Hydrogen burns in air or choxygen, forming water, and hberaes alge
amount of energy This is used in the oxy hydrogen flame for Welding and
feutting metals Temperatures of almost 3000°C can be attained ‘Cae
should be taken with these gases since mixtures of Hy and Os dose ia

Hydrogen reacts with the halogens The reaction with fluonne ts valet
even at low temperatures The reaction with chlorine 1 slow m the dak
Dut the reaction 1s catalysed by light (photocatalysi), and becomes fer

tm daylight, and explosive im sunlight Direct combination of the element,
1s used to produce HCI

A number of metals react with Ha, forming hydndes “The reactions ae
not wolent, and usually require a nigh temperature ‘These are described

Large quantities of Hy are used in the industrial production of ammnona
by the Haber process ‘The reaction 1s reversible, and the formation of
NH 1s favoured by hugh gressure, the presence Of a catalyst (Fe) std

pressure of 200 atmospheres are used to get @ reasonable conversion ns

Large amounts of Hy are used for fydrogenation reactions, tn whieh

portant example 1s the hardening of fats and oils. Unsaturated fatty as
ate hydrogenated with H, anda palladium catalyst forming saturated tty
acids which have higher melting points. By removing double bonds i the
carbon charm im this way edible oxls which are liquid at room temperate
‘may be converted into fats which ate sohd at room temperature The
‘eason for doing thiss that sohid fats are more useful than os, for example
1m the manufacture of margarine

Hydrogen 1s also used 10 reduce mirobenzene to amine (dyesals
andustry), and an the catalytic reduction of benzene (the first step 1
production of nylon 66) It also reacts with CO to form methyl alcobol
