show much greater differences in physical properties than are found
between the isotopes of other elements Some physical constants for Ha,
Dz and Tz are given in Table 8 1
Protium water HzO dissociates to about three times the extent that
heavy water DO does The equitbnium constant for the dissociation of

Protium bonds are broken more readily than deuterium bonds (up #0
18 times more readily m some cases) Thus when water 1s electrolysed, Hy
1s liberated much faster than Dz, and the remaining water thus becomes

the normal way of separating deuterium Heavy water DO undergoes all
of the reactions of ordinary water, and i useful in the preparation of other
deuterium compounds Because D,O has a lower dielectric constant, 10e
