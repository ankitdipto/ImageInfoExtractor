compounds are less soluble in it than in water. Some physical properties of
H,O and D,O are compared in Table 8.2. . ;
Deuterium compounds are commonly prepared by ‘exchange’ reactions
where under suitable conditions deuterium is exchanged for hydrogen in
compounds. Thus D2 reacts with H, at high temperatures, forming HD,
and it also exchanges with NH; and CH, to give NH»D, NHD2, ND3 and
CH3;D—~CD,, It is usually easier to prepare deuterated compounds using
D,0O rather than D2. The D,O may be used directly in the preparation
instead of H2O, or exchange reactions may be carried out using D,O.

Exchange reactions

NaOH + D,0 - NaOD + HDO
NH,Ci + D,0 + NH3DCI + HDO
Mg:N. + 3D,0 > 2ND3 + 3MgO
Direct reactions

SO3 + D20 > D,SO,

Tritium is radioactive and decays by B emission.
37 — 3He + _%e

It has a relatively short half life time of 12.26 years. Thus any T present
when the earth was formed has decayed already, and the small amount
now present has been formed recently by reactions induced by cosmic rays
in the upper atmosphere. ,

Tritium only occurs to the extent of one part T, to7 x 10'7 parts Hp. It was

first made by bombarding D3PO, and (ND,).SO, with deuterons D*

It is Now produced on a large scale by irradiating lithium with slow neu-
trons in a nuclear reactor.

Tritium is used to make thermonuclear devices, and for research into
fusion teactions as a means of producing energy. The gas is usually stored
by making UT;, which on heating to 400°C releases T2. Tritium is widely
used as a radioactive tracer, since it is relatively cheap, and it is easy to
work with. It only emits low energy B radiation, with no y radiation. The B
tadiation 1S stopped by 0.6cm of air, so no shielding is required. It is non-
toxic, xcept if labelled compounds are swallowed.
Tritiated compounds are made from T, gas. TO is made as follows:
