ORTHO AND PARA HYDROGEN

‘The hydrogen motecule Hz exists in two different forms known as ortho
and para hydrogen The nucleus of an atom has nuclear spin ina simlat
‘way to electrons having a spin In the H molecule, the two nucle may be
spinning in either the same direction, or sn opposite directions This pes
‘nse fo spin somensm, that 1s two different forms of Hy may exist These
are called ortho and para hydrogen Spin rsomerism ts also found in otter
symmetncal molecules whose mucles have spin momenta, € g Dz NF:
Ch; There are considerable differences between the physical properties
(€¢ bouling points, specfic heats and thermal conductivities) of the orto
and para forms, because of differences in thesr internal energy There ate
also differences sn the band spectra of the ortho and para forms of Hy

The para form has the lower energy, and at absolute zero the gas con
tans 100% of the para form As the temperature 1s raised, some ofthe
para form changes into the ortho form At high temperatures the g8
contains about 75% ortho hydrogen

Para hydrogen ts usually prepared by passing a moxture ofthe two forms
‘of hydrogen through a tube packed with charcoal cooled to liquid at
temperature Para hydrogen prepared in this way can be kept for weeksat
oom temperature 1n a glass vessel, because the ortho-para conversion
1s slow im the absence of catalySts| Suitable catalysts mclude activated
charcoal, atomic hydrogen, metals such as Fe, Ni, Pt and W and port
‘magnetic substances or tons (which contain unpaved electrons) such 35

HYDRIDES

Binary compounds of the elements with hydrogen are called hydndes Te
type of hydnde which an element forms depends on its clectroneg2)
and hence on the type of bond formed. Whilst there i nota sharp don
between tonte, covalent and metallic bonding st 1 convement to consrder
Ihydndes in thce classes (Figure 82)

1 tonic or salt hke hydrides
2 covalent or molecular hydrides
3 metalic or anterstttal hydrides
