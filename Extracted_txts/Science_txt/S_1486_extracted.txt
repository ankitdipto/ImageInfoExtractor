lonic or salt-like hydrides

At high temperatures the metals of Group 1 (alkali metals) and the heavier
Group 2 metals (alkaline earth metals) Ca, Sr and Ba form ionic hydrides
such as NaH and CaH>. These compounds are solids with high melting
points, and are classified as ionic (salt-like) hydrides. The evidence that
they are ionic is:

1. Molten LiH (m.p. 691°C) conducts electricity, and Hz is liberated at
the anode, thus confirming the presence of the hydride ion H~

2. The other ionic hydrides decompose before melting, but they may be
dissolved in melts of alkali halides (e.g. CaH2 dissolves in a eutectic
mixture of LiCI/KCl), and when the melt is electrolysed then Hp is
evolved at the anode.

. The crystal structures of these hydrides are known, and they show no
evidence of directional bonding.

Lithium is more polarizing and hence more likely to form covalent
compounds than the other metals. Thus if LiH is largely ionic, the others
must be ionic, and thus contain the hydride ion H~

The density of these hydrides is greater than that of the metal from
which they were formed. This is explained by H~ ions occupying holes in
the lattice of the metal, without distorting the metal lattice. Ionic hydrides
have high heats of formation, and are always stoichiometric.

This type of hydride is only formed by elements with an electronega-
