HYDROGEN AND THE HYDRIDES 7

 

tunty value appreciably lower than the vatue of 2 for hydrogen thas
lowing the hydrogen fo attract an electron from the metal, forming M
and Ht

Group 1 hydndes are more reactive than the corresponding Group 2
hydrides, and reactunty increases down the group

Except for LiH, rome hydrides decompose into these consent eee
ments on strong heating (400-500°C)

Covatent hydrides

Hydndes of the p block elements are covalent ‘This would be expected
since there 1s only a small difference in clectronegativnty between these
atoms and hydrogen The compounds usually consist of discrete covalent
molecules. with only weak van der Waals forces holding the molecules
together and so they arc usually volatile. and have low melting and boing
points They do not conduct electricity ‘The formula of these hydrides

belongs These hydrides are produced by a variety of synthetic methods
