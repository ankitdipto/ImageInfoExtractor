HYDROGEN AND THE HYDRIDES ——

4 Uranium 1s unusual and forms two different erystalle forms of UE
that are stoichiometne

5 Somme elements (V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Ni and Pd) form hydndes appronmat
ing to MH Formulae such as NbH 7 and PdHo gare typical. These at
less stable than the other hydrides, are nonstorchiometnic and exist over
1a wide range of composition

‘The Pa/tt, system 1s both extraordinary and interesting When red hot
dis cooted in Hit may absorb or occlude up t0 935 times its own volume
of H; gas. This may be used to separate H, or deuterium D> from He ot
lother gases The hydrogen 1s gen off when the metal 1s heated, and ths
provides an easy method of weighing Hz The hmniting formmuta 1s Palys

but neither the structure nor the mature of the interaction between Pa
and H are understood As hydrogen 1s absorbed, the metallic conduct

iy decreases, and the material eventually becomes a semiconductor The
hydrogen 1s mobrle and diffuses throughout the metal It as possible that
the erroneous reports of producing energy by ‘cold fusion’ by electroyss
‘of D;0 at room temperature between Pd electrodes was realy energy fro™
the reaction between Pd and Dz rather than nuclear fusion of hydrogen
‘or deuterwm to gwe helum (See Chapter 31 )

 

Intermediate hydedes

‘A few hydrides do not fit easily nto the above classification ‘Thus (BeH:)+
1s polymene, and ss thought to be a chain polymer with hydrogen bridges
“Mel has properties im between those of tonic and covalent hydndes

Cull, ZnH, CdH; and HgH, have properties intermediate betwee
‘metalic and covalent hydrides They are probably electron deficient bE
(Alit,),, CuH 1s endothermic, that x8 energy must be put m to make he
‘compound, and 1s formed by redueing Cu*~ with hypophosphorous acid
‘The hydides of Zn, Cd and Hg are made by reducing the chlorides with
LUA)

‘THE HYDROGEN ION

‘The energy requited to remove the clectron from a hydrogen atom (1€
the ronization energy of hydrogen) 1s 1311 kJ mol! ‘This 1s a very lange
amount of energy. and consequently the bonds formed by hydrogen inthe
25 phase ate typially covalent. Hydrogen fluonde 1s the compound most
Iikely to contain tonic hydrogen (te H"). since tt has the greatest df
ference in electronegatwity. but even here the bond s only 45% torie
‘Thus compounds containing H* vall only be formed if the ronization
energy can be provided by some other process Thus if the compound
dissolved, for example an water, then the hydration energy may offset tht

the energy evolved 1s 1091 KI mol™! The remainder of the 1311 kil
