In a similar way the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in
fo mitrophenol reduces its acidity compared with m mitrophenot and p-
ritrophenol, where the formation of a hydrogen bond 1s not possitle
(Figure 8 5)

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding may also take place, and st has a
striking effect on the physteal properties such 25 melting porns, boding
points, and the enthalpies of vaporization and sublimation (Figure 8 6) In
general the melting and boiling points for a related series of compounds
increase as the atoms get larger, owing to the increase in dispersive force
‘Thus by extrapolating the boiling points of HsTe, HSe and HS one would
predit that the boring point of HO should be about ~100°C, whilst tis
actually +100°C Thus water boils about 200°C higher than st would inthe
absence of hydrogen bonding

In much the same way the boiling point of NH 1s much higher than
would be expected by comparison with PH, AsH and SbHs, and similarly
HE boils much hugher than HCl, HBr and HI The reason for the higher
than expected boiling points 1s hydrogen bonding Note that the boring
points of the Group 14 hydndes CH, SiH, Gell and SnH change
smoothly, as they do not mvolve hydrogen bonding

‘The hydrogen bonds in HF link the F atom of one molecule withthe H_
stom of another molecule, thus formng a 21g-2ag chain (HF), 1m both the
liquid and also in the solid (Figure 87) Some hydrogen bonding also
‘occurs im the gas, which consists of a mixture of cycle (HE), polymers,
dimeric (HF);, and monomenc HF (The hydrogen bond in FH Fis
29k mol"! 18 HF )

‘A similar pattern can be seen in the melting pornts and the enthalpies of
vaponzation of the hydrides, indicating hydrogen bonding in NH, HO
and HF, but not in CH, (Figure 8 6c)

Strong evidence for hydrogen bonding comes from structural studies
Examples include ice, which has been determined both by X-ray and
neutron diffraction, the dimen structure of formic actd (determined in
‘the gas phase by electron diffraction), X-ray structures of the sobds
for sodium tydrogencarbonate and bone acid (Figure 8 8), and many
others

Another technique for studying hydrogen bonds 1s infra-red absorption
spectra in CCL solution, which allows the O—H and N—H stzetehng
ftequencies to be studied

 

ACIDS AND BASES

‘There are several so called theontes of actds and bases, but they ae not
really heonies but merely different definitions of what we choose tocallan
aad ora base Since tis only a matter of definition, no theory is more night
or wrong than any other, and we use the most conventent theory for @
Particular chemical situation Which is the most useful theory oF defisiton
of acids and bases? There is no simple answer to this The answer depends
