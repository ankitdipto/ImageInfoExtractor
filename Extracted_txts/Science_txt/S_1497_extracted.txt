260 HYDROGEN AND THE HYDRIDES. Oo

#0 = H* + OH*
‘Thus substances producing H* were called acids, and substances pro
ducing OH” were called bases A typical neutralization reaction is

HCI + NaOH + NaCi + H;0

sod beh er
or simply

HY + OH™ + H:0

In aqueous solutions the concentration of H* ss often given an terms of
pH, where

pits toe FA] = ~fogiolH*1

‘where [H+] i the hydrogen 1on concentration More strictly the activity of,
the hydrogen tons should be used. This logarithmic scale was introduced by
SPL Sorensen in 1909 It then ss very useful for expressing concentrations
over several orders of magnitude (eg 1MH* 1s pH 0, 10°“ MH" is
pH 14)

Until the turn of the mincteenth century it was thought that water was
the only solvent in which rome reactions could occur Studies made by
Cady un 1897 and by Franklin and Kraus sn 1898 on reactions in iqud
ammonia, and by Walden sn 2899 on reactions in tiquid suiphur dioxide,
revealed many analogies with reactions mn water. These suggested that the
three media were tonraing solvents and could be useful for rome reactions,
and that acids, bases end salts were common to all three systems

‘Water selfaomzes:
2H,0 = 1,0" + OH
‘The equilibrium constant for this reaction depends on the concentration
of water [H:0), and on the concentrations of the rons [HO] and [OH]
