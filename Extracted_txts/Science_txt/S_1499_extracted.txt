HYDROGEN AND THE HYDRIDES ]

 

‘The pH scale 1s used to measure the activity of hydrogen 1ns (pl ~
“loglH*)) and a refers to the number of powers often used to exp
the concentration of hydrogen rons ta a similar way the acd dissocaton
constant K, may be expressed as a pK, value

 

pK, = log = ~tog K,

“Thus ph. 182 measure ofthe strength of an acd If the acid omzes anos
completely (bh acid strength) then A, will be large and thus pk wil be
small The pk" values given below show that acid strength ancreases 02

‘With oxoaeids containing more than one hydrogen atom successive ds
soctation constants rapidly become more postive 1 the phosphate
