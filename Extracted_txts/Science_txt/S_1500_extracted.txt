value of 10-7 mol?1~? from the self-ionization are acids, and those that
decrease it are bases. »

The Bronsted-Lowry theory is useful in that it extends the scope of
acid-base systems to cover solvents such as liquid ammonia, glacial acetic
acid, anhydrous sulphuric acid, and all hydrogen-containing solvents. It
should be emphasized that bases accept protons, and there is no need for
them to contain OH™

In liquid ammonia:

NH,Cl + NaNH, > Na*Cl- + 2NH3

acid base salt solvent
or simply:
NH? + NHyz -> 2NH;

aod base solvent
(donates (accepts
a proton) a proton)

Similarly in sulphuric acid:
HSO* + HSO;7 > 2H,SO,

acid base solvent
Chemical species that differ in composition only by a proton are called ‘a
conjugate pair’. Thus every acid has a conjugate base, which is formed
when the acid donates a proton. Similarly every base has a conjugate acid.

In water

In the above reaction, HCl is an acid since it donates protons, and in doing
so forms CI~, its conjugate base. Since HO accepts protons it is a base,
and forms H;0*

base and vice versa.

In liquid ammonia:

NHj + S- = HS7 + NH;

an liquid ammonia all ammonium salts act as acids since they can donate
Protons, and the sulphide ion acts as a base since it accepts protons. The
