reaction i reversible, and st wall proceed in the direction that produces the
weaker species, inthis case HS~ and NH

‘A limitation of the Bronsted-Lowry theory ts that the extent to which a
dissolved substance can act as on acid or a base depends largely on the
solvent The solute only shows acidic properues 1f sts proton donating
properties exceed those of the solvent This sometimes upsets our tradi
tuonal ideas on what are acids, which are based on our expertence of what
happens i water Thus HCIO, 1s an extremely strong proton donor It
liquid HCIO, 1s used as a solvent, then HF dissolved in this solvent 1s
forced to accept protons, and thus act as a base

HClO, + HF = HAF* + Coz

In a similar way HNO 15 forced to accept protons and thus act as a basen
both HCIO, and liquid HF as solvent

Water has only a weak tendency to donate protons The mineral acds
(HCI, HINOs, S04 ete ) all have a much stronger tendency to donate
protons. Thus 1n aqueous solutions the mineral acids all Conate protons
to the water, thus behaving as acids, and in the process the mineral acs
sonize completely

{In liquid ammomta as solvent, the acids which were strong acids in water
all react completely with the armmonra, forming NHZ

HClO, + NH + NHZ + ClOy
HINO, + NH;—+ NHi + NOT

‘Acids which were slightly less strong mn water also react completely wnt
NH, forming NHJ

H,SO_ + 2NH3 > 2NHZ + SOT

‘Weak acids mn water, such as oxalic acid, also react completely with NH,
(COOH), + INH; — 2NHZ + (COO)

‘The acad strengths have all been levelled by the solvent guid ammona

hence liquid ammonia 1s called a levelling solvent It even makes some

‘molecules, such as urea, which show no acidic properties in water, behave
as weak acids
NH,CONH, + NH;~> NHZ + NH,CONH™

Differentiating solvents such as glacial acetic acid emphasze the dit
ference m acid strength, and several mineral acids are only partially 109
‘wed sn this solvent This 1s because aceue acid uself 2s a proton donot,
and sf a substance dissolved in acetic acid 3 10 behave as an acid, it mus
‘donate protons more strongly than acetic aid Thus the dissolved materat
must foree the acetic acid to accept protons (1 the acetc acid behaves 26
a base) Thus the solvent acetic acid makes it more diffiult forthe us!
aids to ronize, and conversely st will encourage the usual bases to sone
completely It follows that a differentiating solvent for acids wll act a8 2
levelling solvent for bases, and vice versa
