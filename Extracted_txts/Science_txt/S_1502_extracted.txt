Lewis theory
Lewis developed a definition of acids and bases that did not depend on the
presence of protons, nor involve reactions with the solvent. He defined
acids as materials which accept electron pairs, and bases as substances
which donate electron pairs. Thus a proton is a Lewis acid and ammonia is
a Lewis base since the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom can be
donated to a proton:
H* + :NH; > [He:NH]*

Similarly hydrogen chloride is a Lewis acid because it can accept a lone
pair from a base such as water though this is followed by ionization:

H,0 + HCI > [H,0:>HCI] > H30* + Cl7
Though this is a more general approach than that involving protons, it has
several drawbacks:

1, Many substances, such as BF; or metal ions, that are not normally
regarded as acids, behave as Lewis acids. This theory also includes
reactions where no ions are formed, and neither hydrogen ions nor any
other ions are transferred (e.g. Ni(CO)4).

acid base

BF; + NH; — [H3N:-BF;]

Ag* + 2NH3— [H3N:>Ag<:NH3]*

Co* + 6CIT > [CoClg]?-

Ni +4CO — Ni(CO),

OQ + C.Hs > CsHsN:-0 (pyridine oxide)

2. There 1s no scale of acid or basic strength, since the strength of an acid
or a base compound is not constant, and varies from one solvent to
another, and also from one reaction to another.

3. Almost all reactions become acid-base reactions under this system.

The solvent system

Perhaps the most convenient general definition of acids and bases is due
to Cady and Elsey, and can be applied in all cases where the solvent un-
dergoes self-ionization, regardless of whether it contains protons or not.

| Many solvents undergo self-ionization, and form positive and negative
tons in a similar way to water:

2H,0 = H;0* + OH-
2NH3 = NHi + NHy
2H2SO,4 = H;SOf + HSOZ
2POCI; = POCI + POCIZ
2BrF; = BrF} + BrFy
N20, = NO* + NOS
