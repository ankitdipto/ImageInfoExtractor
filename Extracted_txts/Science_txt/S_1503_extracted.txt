‘Acids are defined as substances that increase the concentration of the
postive tons charactenstic of the solvent (HO* an the case of water, NH
tn liquid aramoma, and NO* in N04) Bases are substances that crease
the concentration of the negative 1ons charactenstic ofthe solvent (OH™
im water, NH in ammonta, NOS in NO.)

‘There are two advantages to this approach Fist, most of our tradzonal
ideas on what are acids and bases in water remain unchanged, 2s do
eutralzation reactions Second, 1t allows us to consider non aqueous
solvents by analogy with water

‘Thus water ionzes, giving Hs0* and OH™ rons Substances prowséing
H,0* (eg HCI, KNOs and H,S0.) are acids, and substances prowding
OH” (¢ g NaOH and NH.OH) are bases Neutralization reactions are of
the type acid + base + salt + water

HCI + NaOH — NaCl + 4,0

Similarly liquid ammoma ronzes, giving NHZ and NHy tons Thus
ammonium salts are acids since they provide NHZ tons, and sodamide
[NaNH; 1s base since t provides NHy tons Neutralization reactions are of
the type acid + base + salt + solvent

Clearly this definition applies equally well to proton and non proton
systems This broader definition also has advantages when considenng
protonic solvents, since it explains why the acidic or basic properties of a
solute are not absolute, and depend sn part on the solvent We normally
regard acetic acid as an acid, because in water it produces H,O*

CH;COOH + H,0-+ H,0* + CH,COO™

However, acetic ac behaves as a base when sulphuric acd s the sent
sunce H,S0, 1 a stronger proton donor than CH{COOH In a simula way
