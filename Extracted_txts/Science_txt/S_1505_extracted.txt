able, and these prefer ligands that are also small and not very polanzable
Pearson called these metals hard acids, and the ligands hard bases Ina
simular way, type (b) metals and the ligands they prefer are larger and
‘more polanzable, and he called these soft acids and soft bases He stated
the relationship hard acids prefer to react with hard bases, and soft acs
react with soft bases This definition takes in the usually accepted acd~
base reactions (H* strong acid, OH™ and NH, strong bases), and in
addition a great number of reachons involving the formation of simple
‘complexes, and complexes with x bonding ligands
