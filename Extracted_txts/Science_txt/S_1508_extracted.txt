. Give examples of six proton solvents other than water, and show how

they self-ionize.

. What species are characteristic of acids and of bases in the following

solvents: (a) liquid ammonia, anhydrous acetic acid, (b) anhydrous
nitric acid, (c) anhydrous HF, (d) anhydrous perchloric acid, (e) an-
hydrous sulphuric acid, (f) dinitrogen tetroxide.

. Describe how the various physical properties of a liquid affect its

usefulness as a solvent.

. How are the properties of HO, NH; and HF affected by hydrogen

bonding?

Explain the variation in boiling points of the hydrogen halides (HF
20°C, HCl —85°C, HBr —67°C and HI —36°C.

Discuss the theoretical background, practical uses and theoretical
limitations of liquid hydrogen fluoride as a non-aqueous solvent. List
materials which behave as acids and bases in this solvent, and explain
what happens when SbF; is dissolved in HF.

Discuss the theoretical background, practical uses and limitations of
liquid ammonia non-aqueous solvent. Explain what happens when

'SNHCl is dissolved in unlabelled liquid ammonia and the solvent
evaporated.
