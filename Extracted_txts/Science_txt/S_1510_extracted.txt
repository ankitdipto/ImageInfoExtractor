INTRODUCTION

The elements of Group 1 illustrate, more clearly than any other group of
elements, the effects of increasing the size of atoms or ions on the physical
and chemical properties. They form a closely related group, and probably
have the least complicated chemistry of any group in the periodic table.
The physical and chemical properties of the elements are closely related to
their electronic structures and sizes. The elements are all metals, excellent
conductors of electricity, and typically soft and highly reactive. They
have one loosely held valence electron in their outer shell, and typically
form univalent, ionic and colourless compounds. The hydroxides’ and
oxides are very strong bases, and the oxosalts are very stable.

Lithium, the first element in the group, shows considerable differences
from the rest of the group. In all of the main groups the first element shows
a number of differences from the later elements in the group.

Sodium and potassium together make up over 4% by weight of the
earth’s crust. Their compounds are very common, and have been known
and used from very early times. Some of their compounds are used in very
large amounts. World production of NaCl was 183.5 million tonnes in
1992 (most was used to make NaOH and Clz); 38.7 million tonnes of
NaOH were produced in 1994. About 31.5 million tonnes/year of NaxCO3
's used, and NaHCO3, Na,SO, and NaOCl are also of industrial import-
ance. World production of potassium salts (referred to as ‘potash’ and
measured as K,0) was 24.5 million tonnes in 1992. Much of it was used
as fertilizer, but KOH, KNO; and K,O are-also important. In addition
