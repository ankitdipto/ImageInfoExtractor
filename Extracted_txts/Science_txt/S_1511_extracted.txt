‘OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE

Despite therr clase chemical stmulanity, the elements da not occur together
mainly because their 10ns are of different size

lepidolte LizAl(S:Os),(FOH)2 World production of Iathium miners
‘was 8900 tonnes in 1992 The main sources are the Soviet Unton 36%,
Australia 34%, China 12%, Zimbabwe 10%, Chile 9%, and Canada 8%

Sodiwm and potassium are the seventh’ and exghth most abundant
elements by weight sn the earth's crust NaCl and KCI occur in large
amounts in sea water The largest source of sodium 1s rock salt (NC)
Varous salts including NaCl NagB.O7 10H;0 (borax) _(Na:CO,
NaHCO, 2H;0) (trona) NaNOs (saltpetre) and Na,SO« (naabite)
are obtained from deposits formed by the evaporation of ancient sexs
such as the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake at Utah USA Sodium

‘main sources are the USA 19%, China 10%, the Soviet Union 9%, Inda
Tm, Germany 8%, Canada 6%, the UK and Australia 5% each, and
France and Mexico 4% each In most places ts mined as rock salt In the
UK (the Cheshire salt field) about 75% 15 extracted in solution 35 brine,
and similarly in Germany over 70% 1s extracted as brine ‘Sola’ sot 8

cent of the salt produced in India 1s by evaporation, and 26% ofthat from
Spain and France This method 1s also used in Australia

Potassium occurs mainly as deposits of KCI (sylvite), a miature of KCI
and NaC! (sylvimte), and the double salt KCI MgCl; 61,0 (earnalite)
Soluble potassium salts are collectwely called ‘potash’ World productos
