GROUP 1 ~ THE ALKALI METALS |

ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE

Group 1 elements all have one valency electron in their oxter orbyal aos
electron which occupies a spherical orbital Ignoring the filled inner sels
the electronic structures may be wntten 2s'. 3s 4s, Ss} and 7s The
single valence electron 1s a long distance from the nucleus 1s only weal
held and 1s realy removed In contrast the remaining electrons are cl
to the nucleus, more tightly held, and are removed only with great df
ficulty Because of similarities sn the electromie structures of these ee
rments_many similarities in chemical behaviour would be expected

SIZE OF ATOMS AND IONS

Group 1 atoms ate the lagest 1m their horizontal periods inthe pene
table When the outer electron 1s removed to give a posite 10m, the Rt
decreases considerably There are two reasons for ths

1 The outermost shell of electrons has been completely removed

2 Having removed an electron, the postive charge on the nucleus #04
freater than the charge on the remamung electrons, so that eachof He
remaining electrons i attracted more strongly towards the nucleus TH
reduces the size further

Poste tons are always smalfer than the parent atom Even s0 the 6
are very large, and they merease in size from Li” to Fr” as extra shel
electrons are added

‘The Li* 1s much smaller than the other rons For this reason Lr ofly
muxes with Na above 380°C, and it 1s immiscible with the metals K Rb
and Cs even when molten, nor will Li form substitutional alloys wh
them In contrast the other metals Na _K Rb and Cs are miscible wth
each other in all proportions

DENSITY

‘The atoms are large so Group 1 elements have remarkably fow dens
Lithium metal 1s only about half as dense as water, whist sodium #
Potassium are shghtly less dense than water (see Table 93) 1s unis
