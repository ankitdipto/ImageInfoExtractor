‘An clectronegatuity diference of approximately 1 7~1 8 corresponds
50% tonic character The value 2 1 exceeds this, so the bonding in NaClis
predominantly tonic Similar arguments apply to other compounds for

BORN-HABER CYCLE: ENERGY CHANGES IN THE
FORMATION OF IONIC COMPOUNDS.

‘When elements react to form compounds, AG (the free energy of forma
‘von) is negate For a reaction to proceed spontaneously, the free ener)
Of the products must be lower than that of the reactants

Usually the energy changes are measured as enthalpy values AM, and
AG 1s related to AH by the equation

AG = aH - TAS

Jn many cases enthalpy values are used instead of frce energy values and
the two are almost the same ifthe term TAS is small. Atroom temperastt
Tis almost 300K, so AG and AH are only similar when the change
entropy AS is very small Entropy changes are large when there & 2

entropy changes are ustally small

‘A whole series of energy changes 1s involved when one starts from the
elements and finishes with an 1onic erystal These changes are shown ithe

but one of the terms can be measured, then the remaming value cat be
calculated There 1 no direct way of obiaining electron affinity values and
these have been calculated from this type of energy eycle

Hess s faw states that the energy change occurnng during a reaction
depends only on the energy of the mitial reactants and the energy of he
final products and not on the reaction mechanism, or the route taken
‘Thus, by Hess's law, the energy change for the reaction of solid sodum
and chlonne gas to form a sodium chloride crystal by the direct r0¥te
(measured as the enthalpy of formation) must be the same as the sum of
