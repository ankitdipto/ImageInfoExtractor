posite Ionic sohds are formed because an even larger amount of energy
ts evolved, mainly coming from the letice energy and to a smaller extent
from the electron affimty, resulting im a negative value for the enthalpy
of formation AM,

AI! the halides MCI have negative enthalpres of formation, which

‘Table 97 Severat trends are apparent in these values
1. The most negative enthalpies of formation occur with the luondes Foc

any gwen metal. the values decrease in the sequence fluoride > chlonde

> bromide > 1odide Thus the fluondes are the most stable, and the
todides the least stable

2 The enthalpies of formation for the chlorides, bromides and iodides
become mote negative on descending the group Ths trend is observed
with most salts, but the opposite trend 1s found in the fluondes

Tonic compounds may also be formed 19 solution. when a similar yee
‘of energy changes must be considered, but the hydratton energies ofthe
positive and neganwve ions must be substituted for the Iatiee energy

‘The energy cycle shown in Figure 9 31s very similar to the Born-Haber
cycle The enthalpy of formation of hydrated ions fom the elements in
their natural state must be equal tothe sur ofall the other energy changes
