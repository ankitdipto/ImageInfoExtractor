STRUCTURES OF THE METALS, HARDNESS AND COHESIVE
ENERGY

At normal temperatures all the Group 1 metals adopt a body-centred
cubic type of lattice with a coordination number of 8. However, at very
low temperatures lithium forms a hexagonal close-packed structure with
a coordination number of 12.

The metals are all very soft, and can be cut quite easily with a knife.
Lithium is harder than the others, but is softer than lead. Bonding in
metals is discussed in Chapters 2 and 5 in terms of delocalized molecular
orbitals or bands, extending over the whole crystal.

The cohesive energy is the force holding the atoms or ions together in
the solid. (This is the same in magnitude, but the opposite in sign, to the
enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy required to break the solid up
into gaseous atoms.) The cohesive energies of Group 1. metals are about
half of those for Group 2, and one third of those for Group 13 elements.
The magnitude of the cohesive energy determines the hardness, and it
depends on the number of electrons that can participate in bonding and
on the strength of the bonds formed. The softness, low cohesive energy
and weak bonding in Group 1 elements are consequences of these metals
having only one valency electron which can participate in bonding (com-
pared with two or more electrons in most other metals), and of the large
Size and diffuse nature of the outer bonding electron. The atoms become
larger on descending the group from lithium to caesium, so the bonds

are weaker, the cohesive energy decreases and the softness of the metals
increases,
