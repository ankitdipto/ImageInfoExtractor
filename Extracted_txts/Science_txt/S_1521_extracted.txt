FLAME COLOURS AND SPECTRA

A result of the low ‘ontzation energies that when these elements are
‘wradiated with light, the light energy absorbed may be sufficient to make
an atom lose an electron Electrons emutted in this way ate called photo
electrons. and this explains the use of caestum and potassium as cathodes
sm photoelectric cells

Electrons may also be quite readily excted to a higher energy level for
example in the flame test To perform this test, a sample of the metal
chlonde, oF any salt of the metal moistened with concentrated HCI 1
heated ona platinum or michrome wire na Bunsen burner flame The best
feom the burner excites one of the orbital electrons to a higher emery
