Cc GROUP ! — THE ALKALI METALS: —]

pounds of Group 1 metals are typically white, except those where the anion
fs coloured, for example sodwm chromate Na3{CrO,] (yellow), patasstum
dichromate Ke[Cr20>] (orange), and potassim permanganate K(Mn0,)
{deep purple). In these cases the colour comes fram the anvoas (C104),
[Cr,07} of [MnQ,]” and not from the Group 1 metal 1on

‘When Group 1 elements form compounds (usually onc, but there area
few covalent compounds) all the electrons are paired Because of ths
Group 1 compounds are diamagnetic There 1s one notable exception =
Ihe superoxides, which are discussed later
