water and the molten metal skates about vigorously and may catch fire
(especially if localized), and potassium melts and always catches fire.

The standard electrode potentials E° are Li*|Li = 3.05 volts,
Na*|Na = 2.71, K*|K = —2.93, Rb*|Rb = —2.92, Cs*|Cs = —2.92.
Lithium has the most negative standard electrode potential of any element
in the periodic table, largely because of its high hydration energy. Standard
electrode potentials E° and Gibbs free energy AG are related by the
equation:

AG = —nFE°

where n is the number of electrons removed from the metal to produce the
ion, and F is the Faraday constant.

The reaction Li* + e — Li has the largest negative E° value, and hence
the largest positive AG value. Thus the reaction does not occur. However,
the reverse reaction Li > Li* + e has a large negative value of AG, so
lithium liberates more energy than the other metals when it reacts with
water. In view of this it is at first sight rather surprising that lithium reacts
gently with water, whereas potassium, which liberates less energy, reacts
violently and catches fire. The explanation lies in the kinetics (that is the
tate at which the reaction proceeds), rather than in the thermodynamics
(that is the total amount of energy liberated). Potassium has a low melting
point, and the heat of reaction is sufficient to make it melt, or even vapor-
ize. The molten metal spreads out, and exposes a larger surface to the
water, so it reacts even faster, gets even hotter and catches fire.

Reaction with air

Chemically, Group 1 elements are very reactive, and tarnish rapidly in dry
air. Sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium form oxides of various
types, but lithium forms a mixture of the oxide and the nitride, Li,N.

Reaction with dinitrogen

Lithium is the only element in the group that reacts with dinitrogen to form
a nitride. Lithium nitride, LizN, is ionic (3Li* and N?>), and is ruby red.
Two reactions of the nitride are of interest. First, on heating to a high
temperature it decomposes to the elements, and second, it reacts with
water, giving ammonia.
