GROUP | — THE ALKALI METALS

 

OXIDES, HYDROXIDES, PEROXIDES AND SUPEROXIDES +

Reaction with aur

“The metas all burn in aur to form oxides, though the the product vanes
epending on the metal Lathwm forms the monoxide 1130 (and seme
pperonide L1,0;), sodium forms the peroxde Na,O3 (and some monoxide
1Na,0), and the others form superoxides ofthe type MOz

All five metals ean be induced to form the normal oxide, peroxide ot
superoxide by dissolvng the metal m guid ammonia and bubbling ia the
appropriate amount of dioxygen

Normal oxides monoxides .

“The monoxides are vont. for example 2L1* and OF L1,0 and Na,0 are
pure white solids as expected, but surprisingly KO 1s pale yellow, Rb:O
1s bright yellow and Cs,O 1s orange Metallic oxides are usually basic The
typical oxides M;O are strongly base oxides, and they react with water,
forming strong bases

 

LAO + 1,0 — 2L:0H
Na,O + H,0 + 2N20H
K,0 + H,0—> 2KOH
‘The erystal structures of LO, NazO KO and Rb:O are anti fluonte
structures ‘The antrfluonte structure 1s ike that for fluorite CaF: except
that the positions of the postive and negative ons are interchanged Thus
L1* fillthe sites occupied by F~, and O* fil sites occupied by Ca" Cs:0
has an anty CdCl, layer structure

 

Hydroxides

Sodium hydroxide NaOH 1s often called caustic soda, and potassum
hydroxide 1s called caustie potash. because of the corrosive propertts
{for example on glass or on skin) “These caustic alkales are the strongest
bases known in aqueous solution ‘The hydroxides of Na, K. Rband Csart
very soluble in water, but LiOH 1s much less soluble (see Table 912) At
