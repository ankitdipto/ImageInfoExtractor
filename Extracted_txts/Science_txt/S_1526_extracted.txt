25°C a saturated solution of NaOH is about 27 molar, whilst saturated
LiOH is only about 5 molar.

The bases react with acids to form salts and water, and are used for
many neutralizations.

NaOH + HCI —> NaCl + H,0

The bases also react with CO3, even traces in the air, forming the car-
bonate. LiOH is used to absorb carbon dioxide in closed environments
such as space capsules (where its light weight is an advantage in reducing
the launching weight).

2NaOH + CO2— Na2CO; + H,0

They also react with the amphoteric oxides, AlO3 forming aluminates,
SiO, (or glass) forming silicates, SnO, forming stannates, PbO forming
plumbates and ZnO forming zincat€s. . .

The bases liberate ammonia from both ammonium salts and coordina-
tion complexes where ammonia is attached to.a transition metal ion
(ammine complexes).

NaOH + NH,Cl > NH; + NaCl + H,0
6NaOH + 2{Co(NH;)6]Cls > 12NH3 + Co,0 + 3NaCl + 3H,0

hexammine

cobalt(III) chloride
NaOH reacts with H2S to form sulphides S?-, and hydrogen sulphides
SH”, and it is used to remove mercaptans from petroleum products.

NaOH + H,S — NaSH -> NajS
The hydroxides react with alcohols, forming alkoxides.
NaOH + EtOH — NaOEt + H,O0

sodium ethoxtde

KOH resembles NaOH in all its reactions, but as KOH is much more
expensive it is seldom used. However, KOH is much more soluble in
alcohol, thus producing OC,H= ions by the equilibrium

C,H;OH + OH™ = OC;Hz + H,0

This accounts for the use of alcoholic KOH in organic chemistry. Group 1
hydroaides are thermally stable, illustrating the strong electropositive

nature of the metals. On heating, many hydroxides decompose, losing
water and forming the oxide.

Peroxides and superoxides

The peroxides all contain the [—O—O—}*~ ion. They are diamagnetic
(all the electrons are paired), and are oxidizing agents. They may be
regarded as salts of the dibasic acid H.O2, and they react with water and
acid, giving hydrogen peroxide H203.
