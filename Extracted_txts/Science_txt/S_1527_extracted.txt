pulp paper and fabnes such 38 cotton and linen 1118 a powerful omidant,
and many of uts reactions are dangerously violent, particularly with mat
ferals that are reducing agents such as aluminum powder, charcoal,
sulphur and many organie liquids Because it reacts with COs in the arit

bath removes CO; and produces O; Potassium superoxide KOs s even
better for this purpose Some typical reactions are

‘The superonides contain the 10n [03], which has an unpaired electron,
‘and hence they are paramagnetic and are all coloured (LiO2 and NaO;
yellow, KO; orange, ROO; brown and CsO; orange)

'NaO, has three different crystal structures, the marcasite structure at
liquid aur temperatures, the pyntes structure FeS; between —77°C and
~50°C, and a calenum carbide CaCe structure at room temperature Both
the pyrtes and calewum carbide structures are related to the NaCl structure
tn that the metat ions occupy the Na” sites, and O3, SJ” and C3" rons are
centred on the CI” sites Since the negative 1ons contain two atoms, their
shape 1 an elongated rod rather than a sphere In the CaCy structure, the
CE tons are all oriented along one of the cubic axes, and thus the Unt
cell1s elongated in that direction hence the untt cell 15 cubic an NaCl but
tetragonal in CaCz. ‘The pyntes structure 1s simular, but the CF sons are
not allan alignment, and the cubic structure 1s retained

Superonides are even stronger oxidizing agents than peroxides, aod
