Sodium superoxide cannot be preparea vy burning the metal in dioxygen
at atmospheric pressure, but it is made commercially and in good yields
by reacting sodium peroxide with dioxygen at a high temperature and
pressure (450°C and 300 atmospheres) in a stainless steel bomb.

The bonding in peroxides and superoxides is described in the
examples of molecular orbital treatment in Chapter 4. The peroxide ion
[—o—o—]?- has 18 electrons, which occupy the molecular orbitals as
shown:

increasing energy

Thus the bond order is one, corresponding to a single bond.
The superoxide ion [O2]~ has only 17 electrons, which give a bond
order of 1.5.

Generally, large atoms or ions form weaker bonds than small ones. The
peroxide and superoxide ions are large, and it is noteworthy that the
stability of the peroxides and superoxides increases as the metal ions
become larger. This shows that large cations can be stabilized by large
anions, since if both ions are similar in size the coordination number will

be high, and this gives a high lattice energy.

SULPHIDES’
The metals all react with sulphur, forming sulphides such as Na2S, and

Polysulphides Na2S,, where n = 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The polysulphide ions are
made from zig-zag chains of sulphur atoms.

Sodium sulphide can also be made by heating sodium sulphate with
carbon, or by passing HS into NaOH solution.

Group 1 sulphides hydrolyse appreciably in water, giving strongly alkaline

solutions:
