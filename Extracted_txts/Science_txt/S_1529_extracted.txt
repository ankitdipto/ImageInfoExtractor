NaS + H;0 + NaSH + NaQH.

[NaS used to make organic sulphur dyestuffs and in the leather dusty
to remove hair from hides Na3S 1s ready oxidized by air to form sods,

as a laboratory reagent for iodine titrations

SODIUM HYDROXIDE

Sodium hydroxide 1S the most important alkali used in industy Its
produced on a large scale (38 7 millon tonnes in 1994) by the electolys
‘of an aqueous solution of NaCI (brine) using either a diaphragm cet
a mercury cathode cell At one time at was also made from NayCOs by the
Inme~caustie soda process. but this 1s only used a lutte nowadays a otter
methods are cheaper Details of the industrial methods uses and
rages are gwen in Chapter 10

SODIUM HYDROGENCARBONATE (SODIUM BICARBONATE)

‘About 900000 tonnes of NaHCO were produced in 1991 of which 40%
1s used for baking powder 15% to make other chemrcals 12% in pharmt
ceutical products including. anti acid preparations for indigestion 234

2NaHCO,E==", NasCO, + HO + CO
Baking powder 1s more commonly used and contains NaHCO:
Ca{HsPO4)» and starch The Ca(HsPO,)> 1s acidic and when most
ened it reacts with NaHCO, giving CO, The starch 1s a filer Ania
proved combination baking powder contains about 40% starch 30%
NaHCO, 20% NoAl(SO%)» and 10% Ca(HsPO,)> The NzAl(s0e
slows the reaction down so the COs 1s piven off more slowly

SODIUM SULPHATE

About 43 million tonnes of NazSO, were used 1n 1993 About S5% tf
