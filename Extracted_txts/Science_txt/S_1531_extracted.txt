Alkal: meta! nitrates are widely used as molten salts as a solvent in which
to carry out high temperature oxidations, and also as a heat transer
medium They are used up to around 600°C, but molten salt baths are
‘often used at much lower temperatures For example, a 11 muxture of
LiNOy/KNOs melts at the surprisingly low temperature of 125°C
Nitrites are important in the manufacture of organonitrogen com
‘pounds, the most smportant being the azo dyes. Small amounts of NaNO,
are used in molten salt baths with NaNOs, and some ts used 2s a food
preservative Nuintes are easily recognized in the laboratory, because on
treatment with dilute acids they produce brown fumes of NOz

HALIDES AND POLYHALIDES

Since L1* 1s the smallest 1on in the group, would be expected to form
hydrated salts more ready than the other metals LiCl, LiBr and La form
‘unhydrates LiX 31,0. but the other alkali metal halides form anhydrous
enystals

All the halides adopt a NaCl type of structure wath a coordination
rumaber of 6 except for CsCl, CsBr and CsI. The latter have a CsCl ype of
structure with a coordination number of 8 Rather more compounds adopt
the NaCt type of structure than would be expected from the radius rates
‘of the rons r*/e", and the reason for this structure being adopted is that
