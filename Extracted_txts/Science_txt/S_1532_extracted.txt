[ HYDRIDES

The alkali metal halides react with the halogens and interhalogen
compounds forming ionic polyhalide compounds:

HYDRIDES

Group 1 metals all react with hydrogen, forming ionic or salt-like hydrides
M*tH™. However, the ease with which they do so decreases from lithium
to caesium. These hydrides contain the H™ ion (which is not commonly
found, since hydrogen usually forms H* ions). It can be proved that H~
ions exist because on electrolysis hydrogen is liberated at the anode.

The hydrides react with water, liberating hydrogen, and lithium hy-
dride is used as a source of hydrogen for military purposes and for filling
meteorological balloons.

Lithium also forms a complex hydride Li[AIH,], called lithium aluminium
hydride, which is a useful reducing agent. It is made from lithium hydride
in dry ether solution.

4LiH + AICI; > Li{AIH,] + 3LiCl

Lithium aluminium hydride is ionic, and the [AIH4]~ ion is tetrahedral.

Li[AIH,] is a powerful reducing agent and is widely used in organic.

with water, so it is necessary to use absolutely dry organic solvents, for
example ether which has been dried over sodium. Li[AlH,] will also
teduce a number of inorganic compounds.

Sodium tetrahydridoborate (sodium borohydride) Na[BH4] is another
hydride complex. It is ionic, comprising tetrahedral [BH4]™ ions. It is best
obtained by heating sodium hydride with trimethyl borate:

4NaH + B(OCH3);——""S, Na[BH,] + 3NaOCH
