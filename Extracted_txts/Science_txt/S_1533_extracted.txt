SOLUBILITY AND HYDRATION

[Al the simple salts dissolve in water, producing tons, and consegus
the solutions conduct electricity Since L1* rons are small, st mught be
expected that solutions of lithium salts would conduct electrty beter
than solutions of the same concentration of sodium, potassum, rubidiim,
for caesium salts. The small 1ons should migrate more easily towards the
cathode, and thus conduct more than the larger tons However, tone
‘mobihty oF conductivity measurements i aqueous solution (Table 913)
give results in the opposite order Cs* > Rb* > K* > Na* > Li* The
reason for this apparent anomaly 1s that the tons are hydrated in soluton
Since L1* 1s very small, it 1s heavily hydrated This makes the rads of
the hydrated ron large, and hence it moves only slowly In contrast, Cs*
ts the least hydrated, and the radws of the hydrated Cs” 10n 1s smal
than the radws of hydrated Li”, and hence hydrated Cs* moves faster
and conducts electricity more readily

‘The hydration number 1s the average number of water molecules astocted wth
the metal ron The values need not be whole numbers and are obtained by
‘measuring the transference of water n a conductiity cell,

Some water molecules touch the metal 1on and bond to st forming a
complex These water molecules constitute the primary shell of wast
‘Thus Li* 1s tetrahedrally sucrounded by four water molecules This may
‘be explained by the oxygen atoms of the four water molecules using 2 lone
pair to form a coordinate bond to the metal ton With four electron pots
1m the valence shell the VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral structure
‘Alternatively, using valence bond theory the 25 orbital and the thre 2p
‘orbitals form four sp" hybrid orbitals which are filled by the lone pars
from the oxygen atoris
