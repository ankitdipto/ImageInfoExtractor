With the heavier ions, particularly Rb* and Cs*, the number of water
molecules increases to six. VSEPR theory predicts an octahedral structure
Valence bond theory also indicates an octahedral arrangement using one s
orbital, three p orbitals and two d orbitals for bonding. ,

A secondary layer of water molecules further hydrates the ions, though
these are only held by weak ion—dipole attractive forces. The strength of
such forces is inversely proportional to the distance, that is to the size of
the metal ion. Thus the secondary hydration decreases from lithium to
caesium, and accounts for Li* being the most heavily hydrated. ‘

Note that the d orbitals comprise a group of three (called tog orbitals),
and a group of two (called e, orbitals). Only the group of two is used
for bonding.
ne size of the hydrated ions is an important factor affecting the passage
aan ions through cell walls. It also explains their behaviour on cation-
nge columns, where hydrated Li* ions are attached

linn’ decrease in hydration from Li* to Cs* is also shown in the crystal-
re salts, for nearly all lithium salts are hydrated, commonly as trihy-
tes. In these hydrated Li salts Li* is coordinated to 6H,0, and the
