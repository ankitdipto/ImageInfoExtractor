(GROUP } — THE ALKALI METALS 1

 

‘octahedra share faces forming chains Many sodium salts are hydrated
eg Na,CO; 10H,0, NajCOs’7H,0 and NaCO; H:0 Few potassutt
salts and no rubidium or caesium salts are hydrated

‘The simple salts are all soluble in water, and so sn qualitative analy
these metals need to be precipitated as less common salts Thus Na"
precipitated by adding zinc (or copper) uranyl acetate solution and pre
capitating NaZn(UO2)(Ac)y HzO sodium zine uranyl acetate K* iS
precipitated by adding a solution of sodium cobaltintite and preepattg
potassium cobaltimitrite Ks{Co(NO2).] or by adding perchloric aid and
precipstating potassium perchlorate KCIO, Group 1 metals can be e&
lumated gravimetrically, sodwm as the uranylacetate, and potassun
rubidium and caesium as tetraphenylborates However modern ist?
‘mental methods such as flame photometry and atomic absorption spet
trometry are much quicker and easier to use and are now used in pre
ference to gravimettic analysts

Ifa salts insoluble is lattice energy 1s greater than the hydration energy
K[B(CeH.)a} 18 insoluble because the hydration energy 1s very small 25 #
result of the large size ofits ons

The solubilty of most ofthe salts of Group I elements in water decreas
‘on descending the group For a substance to dissolve the energy evlied
when the tons are hydrated (hydration energy) must be larger than the
enesgy required to break the crystal lattice (latuce energy) Conversely, tf

Strictly mn the two cycles shown in Figure 9 4 we should use Gibbs fre

the two terms differ only by a small term for the entropy of vaporzatie™
