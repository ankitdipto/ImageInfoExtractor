of the ions. It should in principle be possible to predict solubilities from
lattice energies and hydration energies. In practice there are difficulties in
Predicting solubilities because the values for the data are not known very
accurately, and the result depends on a small difference between two large
values,

The reason why the solubility of most Group 1 metals decreases on
descending the group is that the lattice energy only changes slightly, but
the free energy of hydration changes rather more. For example, the
difference in lattice energy between NaCl and KCI is 67kJ mol}, and
yet the difference in AGnyarationy for Na* and K* is 76kJ mol™!. Thus
KCl is less soluble than NaCl.

The Group 1 fluorides and carbonates are exceptional in that their
solubilities increase tapidly on descending the group. The reason for this
is that their lattice energies change more than the hydration energies on
descending the group.The lattice energy depends on electrostatic attrac-
tion between ions, and is Proportional to the distance between the ions,
that is proportional to 1/(r* + r-). It follows that the lattice energy will
