trations above 3M, solutions are copper—bronze coloured and have a
metallic lustre because metal ion clusters are formed.

These solutions of metals in liquid ammonia conduct electricity better
than any salt in any liquid, and the conductivity is similar to that of pure
metals (specific conductivity of Hg = 10*ohm™'; Na/NH; = 0.5 x
10°ohm=!; K/NH3 = 0.45 x 10*ohm™!). Conduction is due mainly to
the presence of solvated electrons.

The metals are also soluble in other amines and these solutions are used
in organic and inorganic syntheses. These solutions of metals in liquid
ammonia act as powerful reducing agents for the elements of Groups 14,
15 and 16, for many compounds and coordination complexes, and they
will even reduce an aromatic ring.

These reductions can be carried out in liquid ammonia, but not in water,
because the alkali metals are stronger reducing agents than is hydrogen,
and so will react with water and liberate hydrogen. The metals can exist
for some time in liquid ammonia.

Bi + Na/NH; ~ NasBi (Bi reduced from oxidation state 0 to —III)
S + Na/NH; — Na,S (S reduced from oxidation state 0 to —II)
[Ni(CN),]?- + 2e > [Ni(CN)4]*~ (Ni reduced from +II to 0)

COMPOUNDS WITH CARBON

If lithium is heated with carbon, an ionic carbide LizC, is formed. The
other metals do not react with carbon directly, but do form similar carbides
when heated with ethyne (formerly called acetylene), or when ethyne is
passed through a solution of the metal in liquid ammonia.

2Li + 2C — Li,C,
Na + C,H, > NaHC, > NaC,

These compounds contain the carbide ion [C==C]?~ or hydridocarbide ion
[C=C] - The most important reaction of carbides is with water, when
they give ethyne (acetylene). Thus they are termed acetylides.

Na,C, + 2H,O0 - 2NaOH + C,H,

LICH is used in the industrial manufacture of vitamin A.

, The Metals potassium, rubidium and caesium react with graphite by

aading the space between the layers of carbon in the graphite lattice.
