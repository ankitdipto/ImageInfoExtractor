steane acids (Palmic acid CisHyy COOH occurs im palm om oleic sod
CypHsy COOH occurs 1n olive oll and stearic acid CrpHys+ COOH occurs
1m beef ond mutton fat and tallow ) Soap 1s made by the saponifcatin
(hydrolyss) of naturally occurring fats and oils These fets and ous ate
esters of glycerol, and thesr hydrolysis with NaOH first breaks the eterto
slycerol and fatty acids neutralring the fatty ard to gwve the sodium sals
