in the tetrahedron, three C at the centres of faces of the tetrahedron, and
one Li in another tetrahedron.

Lithium ethyl is tetrameric in the solid (LiEt),. but is hexameric (LiEt),
when dissolved in hydrocarbons. The solid is similar in structure to
(LiCH3)s. and the hexamer is thought to comprise an octahedron of Li
atoms with Et groups above six of the eight faces, involving multi-centre
bonding.

n-Butyl lithium is also tetrameric in the solid (LiBu),. It is commercially
available. Production is about 1000 tonnes/year. The main uses are as a
polymerization catalyst and for alkylation. It is a very versatile reagent in
the laboratory for the synthesis of aromatic derivatives and unsaturated
derivatives such as vinyl and allyl lithium. Many of these reactions are
similar to those using Grignard reagents.

From these an extremely wide range of organometallic and organic com-
pounds can be prepared.

These compounds are ionic M*R~, and are extremely reactive. ‘They catch
fire in air, react violently with most compounds except dinitrogen and
saturated hydrocarbons, and are consequently difficult to handle.
