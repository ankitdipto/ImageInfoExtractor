‘A number of aqua complexes are known such as [Li(H;0),]* anda

found in vanous crystalline salts Na* and K* also have the same pnmaty
hydration shell, but Rb* and Cs* coordinate six HO molecules. Statle
complexes are formed with phosphine oxides, for example complexes of

cyanoferrates, are known in solutton

However, some organ chelating agents (particularly salicaldehyde ad
B ciketones) are extremely strong complexing agents and Group 1 185
form complexes wath these These ligands are very strong complesié
agents because they are multidentate that 1s they have more than of
donor group so they form more than one bond to the metal, and a0
because they form a ring or chelate compound by bonding to the met
