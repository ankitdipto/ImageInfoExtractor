cells to transport ions across cell membranes, and thus maintain the balance
between Nat and K+ inside and outside cells.

The cryptates are three-dimensional equivalents of the crown ethers, but
contain nitrogen atoms which provide branching and act as extra donor
sites in addition to the oxygen atoms to bond to the metal ion. They are
called cryptates because they wrap round and hide the cation. A typical
crypt is the molecule N(CH,CH,OCH,CH;0CH2CH3I3N. This is called
(cryptand-222) and forms a complex [Rb(crypt)}CNS -H,O in which six
Oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms in the crypt molecule bond to
the metal ion, giving the metal ion a coordination number of 8. The
ligand completely wraps round the metal ion. hiding it: hence the name
crypt. The complex presents a hydrocarbon exterior, and so is soluble
in organic solvents. Such complexes are used for solvent extraction, stabil-
izing uncommon oxidation states, and Promoting otherwise improbable
Teactions.

An unusual compound [Na(cryptand-222)}*Na™~ can be formed by
