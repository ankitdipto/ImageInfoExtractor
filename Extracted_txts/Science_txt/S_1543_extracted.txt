studies show that the radwws of Na” 1s about 23A. Electron transfer has
‘occurred between two sodium atoms, forming Na* and Na” The ltge

paramagnetic, so they contain unpaired electrons They have formulse

BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE

Living organisms require at least 27 elements, of which 15 are metals
Metals required in major quantities are K, Mg Na and Ca Minor quan
mes of Mn Fe, Co, Cu Zn and Mo, and trace amounts of V, C3. $0 Nt
and Al, are requited by at least some organisms

Bulk quantities of Group 1 and 2 metals are required, mainly to bulsnce
