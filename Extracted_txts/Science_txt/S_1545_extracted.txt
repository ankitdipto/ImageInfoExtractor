(GROUP I ~ THE ALKALI METALS

 

 

LiOH all form the oxide on gentle heating, though the anao
compounds of the rest ofthe group are stable ‘Another example ofthe
Tess basic nature that though lithium forms a brearbonate in soliton,
at does not form a solid bicarbonate, whereas the others all form tai.
solid bicarbonates

5 Lithium forms a mtride Lis None of the other Group 1 elemens
forms a nitride, but Group 2 elements form nitrides

6 Lithwm reacts directly with carbon to form an onic carbide None of
the other Group 1 elements do this, but Group 2 elements all rex
similarly with earbon

7 Lithium has a greater tendency to form complexes than have te
heavier elements, and ammoniated salts such as [La(NH,)ql exst
solids

8 LyCO,, LPO, and LiF are all soluble an water, and LOH 3 only
sparingly soluble The rest of Group 1 form soluble compounds, bat
the corresponding magnestum sats are msoluble or sparingly solibie

9 The hahdes and alkyls of lithium are far more covalent than the
‘corresponding sodium compounds, and because of this covalency they
are soluble in organic solvents. Simuarly, lithium perchlorate and toa
lesser extent sodium perchlorate resemble magnestum perchlorate i
their high solubility 1 acetone (propanone)

10 The hthium ion itself, and also sts compounds. are more heaniy
hydrated than those of the rest of the group

Several generalizations may be drawn from thas apparently anomalous
behaviour of fthium

‘The fist element m each of the main groups (La, Be. B.C N OandF)
‘fers from the rest of the group This s parly because the first elements
touch smaller than the subsequent elements and consequently i more
likely to form covalent compounds (Fajans rules) and complexes

‘The first element mn @ group can form a maximum of four conventional
clectron pair bonds This 1s because the outer shell of electrons cons
‘only one s orbital and three p orbitals The subsequent elements cen used
‘orbitals for bonding they can attain a coordination number of 6 by using
ones thee p and two d orbitals For this reason the coordination mber
attained by a complex or a covalent compound of the first element mn 2
group 1s commonly 4 and for the subsequent elements the coordination
‘number 1s commonly 6 This simple concept is based on a bond consisting
of two electrons shared between two atoms Exceptions occur when nul
centre bonds are formed (as.an Lay(CH),)

“The similarity between Iahwm (the first member of Group 3) and
magnesium (Ihe second element in Group 2) 1s called a diagonal rea
tuonship Diagonal relationships also exist Between other pats of elements
