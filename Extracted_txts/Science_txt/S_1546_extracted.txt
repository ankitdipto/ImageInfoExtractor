The diagonal relationship arises because of the effects of both size and
charge. On descending a group, the atoms and ions increase in size. On
moving from left to right in the periodic table, the size decreases. Thus on
moving diagonally, the size remains nearly the same. For example, lithium
is smaller than sodium, and magnesium is also smaller than sodium, and
hence lithium and magnesium are similar in size. The sizes of Lit = 0.76A
and Mg2* = 0.72A are close, and so in situations where size is important
their behaviour should be similar.

Beryllium and aluminium also show a diagonal relationship. In this case
the sizes are not so close (Be2* = 0.45A and Al* = 0.535 A), but the
charge per unit area is similar (Be’* 2.36 and Al** 2.50) because the
charges are 2+ and 3+ respectively.

It is sometimes suggested that the diagonal relationship arises because
of a diagonal similarity in electronegativity values.

Since ionic size and electronegativity are closely related, this is part of the
same picture.
