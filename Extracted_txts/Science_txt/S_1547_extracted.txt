PROBLEMS
1 Why are Group 1 elements

(a) univatent

(b) largely 1onte

(©) strong redueing agents

(@) poor complexing agents?

(©) Why do they have the lowest first sontzation energy values in thet
penods?

2. Why are the Group 1 metals soft low melting and of low density”
(Refer back to Chapter 5 )

3 Lithium isthe smallest ton in Gtaug L Tt would therefore be exgected
to have the highest ronte mobility, and hence solutions of is sas
would be expected to have a higher conductivity than soleuons of
‘caesium salts. Explain why this 1s not so

4 What 1s the reason for lthwum having a greater tendency to fort
covalent compounds than the other elements n the group?

5 The atomic radius for Inhium 1s 123A When the outermost 2
clectron ts ionized off the 1onic radius of Lr* 1s 76A. Assuming th
the difference 1n radu relates (0 the space occupted by the 2s elect
calculate what percentage of the volume of the Ithium atom
‘occupied by the single valence electron Is this assumption fart?
(Wolume of a sphere 1s4 m1” ) (Answer 76 4% )

6 Why and sn whit ways does tithium resemble magnesium?

7 What products are formed when each of the Group 1 metals s burnt
dhoxygen? How do these products react with water? Use the molecu"
