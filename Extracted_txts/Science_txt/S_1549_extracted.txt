20, 0.347g of a metal (A) was dissolved in dilute HNOs. This solution
gave a red coloration t0 a non-luminous Bunsen burner fame, andon
evaporation gave 0.747g of metal oxide (B). (A) also reacted wth
dinitrogen, forming a compound (C), and with hydrogen, fomng
(D). On reacting 0.1590g of (D) with water, a gas (E) was evoled
and a sparingly soluble compound (F) formed, which gave a strongy
basic reaction and required 200m! of 0.1000M hydrochloric and 1»

neutralize it. Identify the substances (A) to (F) and explain the
reactions involved.
