The chlor-alkali industry

 

The chlor-alkali industry includes the production of three main chemicals:
sodium hydroxide (sometimes called caustic soda), chlorine, and sodium
carbonate (sometimes called soda ash). All three chemicals are made from
sodium chloride.

NaOH and Cl, are produced simultaneously by the electrolysis of an
aqueous solution of NaCl. NaOH is the most important alkali used in in-
dustry, and Cl, is also an extremely important industrial chemical. Sodium
carbonate is included with the other two chemicals for two reasons — first
because in many applications such as making paper, soap and detergents it
can be used interchangeably with sodium hydroxide, and second because
Na,COs can quite easily be converted into NaOH (or vice versa) using
the lime-caustic soda process. In this process, the reaction is reversible,
and depending on the relative demands and cost of sodium carbonate and
sodium hydroxide it may be used in either direction. Before 1955 Na,CO3
was used very extensively for water softening as it prevented the formation
of scum when using soap in hard water. Soap is discussed under ‘Organic
and organometallic compounds’ in Chapter 9, and hard water is discussed
in Chapter 11. Thus before 1955 it was economic to make NazCO3 from
NaOH. More recently the use of soap has declined as detergents have
become more widely used, and with this the demand for Na;CO3 has

declined. Nowadays the reverse reaction is carried out on a limited scale,
converting NaxCO3 to NaOH.

Na;CO, + Ca(OH), = CaCO; + 2NaOH

All three chemicals are classed as ‘heavy inorganic chemicals’ because of
the very large tonnages involved. A list of the chemicals produced in the
largest quantities is shown in Table 10.1.
