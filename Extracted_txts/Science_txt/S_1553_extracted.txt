"THE CHLOR ALKALT INDUSTRY

fume electrolysis was strictly limited because primary battenes were the
‘only source of electrcity This changed in 1872 when Gramme invented
the dynamo The first commercial electrolytic plant was statted in Frank
fart (Germany) 1n 1691, where the cell was filled, electrolysed, emptied
then refilled and so on This was therefore a discontinuous o7 bach
process Clearly a cell which could run continuously, and did not ned
emptying, would produce more and cost [ess to operate Many develop
ments and patents attempting to exploit the commercial possbitis ap
peared over the next twenty years. The fist commercially operated plat
fo use a continuous diaphragm cell was probably that designed by Le Sear
at Romford (Maine) in 1893, followed by Castner ceils at Saltville (Vi
gina, USA) in 1896 The fist sn the UK was set up by Hargreaves ard
Bird in 1897 at Runcorn In all of these (and also in many modern da
phragm cells), asbestos was used as the diaphragm to separate the anode
and eathode compartments Brine was constantly added, and NaOH and
i, were produced continuously

‘About the same tute, Castner (who was an Amertcan working ia Birm
ingham, England) and Kellner (an Austrian working in Vienna) developed
and patented simular versions of the mercury cathode cell is 1897 Thee
combined patents were used by the Castner Kellner Alkali Company, ao
at Runcorn, and also 10 1897

‘The same two types of cell, diaphragm and mercury cathode sill re
main in use. The eatly electrolytic plants produced about 2 tonnes of
chlorine per day, but modern plants produce 1000 tonnes per day

In the electrolysis of brine, reactions occur at both the anode end the

‘A porous diaphragm of asbestos s used to keep the Hy and Clb gases (10
duced at the electrodes) separated from one another If H and Cts gases
‘mix they react and the reaction may be explosive In daylight (and more
30 1m sunlight) a photolytic reaction takes place which produces chlorine
atoms These lead to an explosive chain reaction with hsdrogen
