very resistant to corrosion, and this not only overcomes the problem of
pitting and forming COz, but also lowers the electrical resistance.

QUANTITIES

In both electrolytic processes (diaphragm cell and mercury cathode cell)
equimolar amounts of Cl and NaOH are produced. Since C] has an atomic
weight of 35.5, and NaOH has a molecular weight of 40, it follows that
electrolysis yields 40 parts by weight of NaOH to 35.5 parts of Cly. This
corresponds to 1.13 tonnes of NaOH for 1 tonne of Clz. In 1994 world
production of Cl, was 35.3 million tonnes.

Prior to 1965 demand for NaOH exceeded that for Cl, so Cl, was
cheap. Since then the position has reversed, largely due to the use of
large amounts of Cl, in making plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. (World
production of PVC was 14.9 million tonnes in 1991.)

SODIUM CARBONATE

World production of NazCO; in 1993 was 31.5 million tonnes, and 49%
of this was used in the glass industry. Smaller amounts were used to make
various sodium phosphates and polyphosphates which are used for water
