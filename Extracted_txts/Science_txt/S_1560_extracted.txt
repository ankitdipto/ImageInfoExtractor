INTRODUCTION

The Group 2 elements show the same trends in properties as were ob-
served with Group 1. However, beryllium stands apart from the rest of
the group, and differs much more from them than lithium does from the
rest of Group 1. The main reason for this is that the beryllium atom and
Be?* are both extremely small, and the relative increase in size from
Be** to Mg?* is four times greater than the increase between Li* and
Na*. Beryllium also shows some diagonal similarities with aluminium in
Group 13. Beryllium and barium compounds are all very toxic.

The elements form a well graded series of highly reactive metals, but are
less reactive than Group 1. They are typically divalent, and generally form
colourless ionic compounds. The oxides and hydroxides are less basic than
those of Group 1: hence their oxosalts (carbonates, sulphates, nitrates)
are less stable to heat. Magnesium is an important structural metal, and is
used in large amounts (303000 tonnes in 1993). Several compounds are
used in vast quantities: limestone (CaCO;) is used to make quicklime
CaO (127.9 million tonnes in 1993) and cement (1396 million tonnes in
1993), and 14.2 million tonnes of chalk are also used. Other compounds
used on a large scale include gypsum CaSO, (88.2 million tonnes in 1992),
fluorite CaF, (3.6 million tonnes in 1992), magnesite MgCO; (10.8 million
tonnes in 1992) and barytes BaSO, (4.9 million tonnes in 1992).

Mg** and Ca?* are essential elements in the human body, and Mg?* is
an important constituent of chlorophyll.
