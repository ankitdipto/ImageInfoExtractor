GROUP 2 ~ THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS q

 

In older processes BeO 1s extracted from beryl BevAlsSi,Orx by heat
treatment of fusion with alkali, followed by treatment with suiphurre aad
to give soluble BeSO, Addition of NH.OH gues Be(OH); which on
hheating gives BeO BeO has ceramic properties, and 1s used ta nuclear
reactors Alternatwely berylhum 1s extracted from the stheate miners
by treatment vath HF, forming the soluble complex sodium tetrafivoiO-
beryllate Nas[BeF.), and converting this to the hydroxide and then to the
‘onde Be stself 1s prepared by converting the hydroxide to BeCl, by heat-
ing with C and Ch, followed by electrolysis of the fused chlonde Alter
natively beryilum 1s obtained by reducing BeF2 with magnesium Be 1
used to make alloys wth other metals Addition of about 2% Be to Cu
metal nereases its strength by a factor of 5 or 6 An alloy of Be with Nt
1s used to make springs and electrical contacts Be has a very low cross
section for neutron capture, and 1s used in the nuclear energy indust'Y
Both Be and BeO have been used in nuclear reactors, and for this purpese
they must be of extremely high purity High purity material 1s obtarned bY
making basic beryllum acetate, purifying ths by distllmg st under reduced
pressure, and then either decomposing it to the oxide by heating, or co
‘erting i to the chloride and then reducing the chloride with Ca or Mg 2
five the metal ‘The absorption of electromagnetic radiation by a solid
depends on its electron density Be has a very low electron density aod
has a smaller absorbing power than any other solid, and for ths reason
stis used to make the windows of X-ray tubes,

‘Magnesium 1s the only Group 2 metal to be produced on a lange scale
‘World production was 303000 tonnes m 1993, The largest producers wet
the USA 48%, the Soviet Union 12%, Canada 9% and Norway 8% MB
ss an extremely important lightweight structural metal because of tS
low density (1 74gem™> compared with steel 7 8gem™? or alumni
27 gem") Mg forms many binary alloys, offen containing up 10 9% Al,
3% Zn and 1% Mn, traces of the lanthanides praseodymum Pr atd
neodymium Nd, and traces of thorum The metal and ss alloys can be
‘cast, machined and welded quite easily 11 18 used to make the bodies UE
aureraft, aureraft parts and motor ear engines, Up to 50 Mg ss usvallY
added to Al to improve sts properties Chemically st 1s important *
Grignard reagents such as CzHsMgBr

Mg was formerly prepared by heating MgO and C to 2000°C, at which
temperature C reduces MgO The gascous mixture of Mg and CO was
then cooled very rapidly to deposit the metal This ‘quenching’ or ‘shock
‘cooling’ was necessary a5 the reaction ts reversible, and if cooled slowly
the reaction will come to equilibrium further to the left
