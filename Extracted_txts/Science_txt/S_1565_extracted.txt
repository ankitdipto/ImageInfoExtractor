Group 2 metals are silvery white in colour They have two valency
electrons which may participate in metallic bonding compared with one
electron for Group 1 metals Consequently Group 2 metals are harder
have higher cohesive energy and have much higher melting pomnts and
borhing points than Group 1 elements (see Table 11 4) but the metas are
relatively soft The melting points do not vary regutacly mainl because
the metits adopt different crvstal structures (see the section on Metallic
bonds and metalhe structures in Chapter 2)

IONIZATION ENERGY

‘The third ionization energy 1s so high that M"* tons are never formed The
tomzation energy for Be * 1s high and xts compounds are typicallh co
valent Mg also forms some covalent compounds However the com
pounds formed by Mg Ca Sr and Ba are predominantly divalent and
tonic Since the atoms are-smaller.than those in Group 1 the electrons are
more tightly held so that the energy needed to remove the first electron
{Girst omzation energy) 1s greater than for Group 1 Once one electron has
been removed the ratio of charges on the nucleus to orbital electrons 35
increased so that the remaining electrons are more ght! held Hence the
energy needed to remove a second electron 1s nearly double that required
