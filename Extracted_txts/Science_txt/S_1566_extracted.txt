for the first. The total energy required to produce gaseous divalent ions for
Group 2 elements (first ionization energy + second ionization energy) is
over four times greater than the energy required to produce M®* from
Group 1 metals. The fact that ionic compounds are formed shows that the
energy given out when a crystal lattice is formed more than offsets that
used in producing ions.

ELECTRONEGATIVITY

The electronegativity values of Group 2 elements are low, but are higher
than the values for Group 1. When Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba react with elements
such as the halogens and dioxygen at the right hand side of the periodic
table, the electronegativity difference is large and the compounds are
ionic.

The value for Be is higher than for the others. BeF2 has the biggest
clectronegativity difference for a compound of Be and so is the most likely
compound of Be to be ionic. BeF2 has a very low conductivity when fused,
and is regarded as covalent.

HYDRATION ENERGIES

The hydration energies of the Group 2 ions are four or five times greater
than for Group 1 ions. This is largely due to their smaller size and increased
charge, and AHpyarauon decreases down the group as the size of the ions
increases. In the case of Be a further factor is the very strong complex
[Be(H20), * that is formed. The crystalline compounds of Group 2 con-
‘ain more water of crystallization than the corresponding Group 1 com-
Pounds. Thus NaCl and KCl are anhydrous but MgCl, - 6H20, CaCl, -6H2O
and BaCl;-2HO all have water of crystallization. Note that the num-
