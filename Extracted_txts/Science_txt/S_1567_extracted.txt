ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOUR OF BERYLLIUM
Be differs from the rest of the group for three reasons

1 Itas extremely small_and Fajans rules state that small highly charged
rons tend 10 form covalent compounds

2. Be has a comparatively high electronegatrty Thus when berylium
reacts with another atom the difference in clectronegatinty 1 seldom
large, which again favours the formation of covalent compounds Even
BeF; (electronegatwity difference 25) and BeO (elecitonegatmiy
difference 2 0) show evidence of covalent character

3 Be 1s in the second row of the periodic table and the outer shel can
hhold a maximum of exght electrons (The orbitals availabe for bonding
are one 2s and three 2p orbitals ) Thus Be can form a maximum of for
conventional electron pair bonds and in many compounds the mat
mum coordination number of Be 1s 4 The later elements can have
‘more than eight outer electrons and may attain a coordination number
‘of 6 using one 5, three p and two d orbitals for bonding Exceptions
‘occur if mult centre bonding occurs as for example in basic beryllium
acetate, when higher coordination numbers are obtained

‘Thus we should expect Be to form mamnly covalent compounds and com

‘monly have a coordination number of 4 Anhydrous compounds of Be art
predominantly two covalent and BeX; molecules should be linear
