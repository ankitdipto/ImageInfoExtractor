 

ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOUR OF BERYLLIUM

. Two ligands that have a lone pair of electrons may form coordinate
bonds using the two unfilled orbitals in the valence shell of Be. Thus
two F~ ions might coordinate to BeF2, forming [BeF,]*~. Similarly
diethyl ether can coordinate to Be(+II) in BeClo, forming [BeCl,
(OEtz)2).

2. The BeX molecules may polymerize to form chains, containing bridg-
ing halogen groups, for example (BeF2),,, (BeClz),,. Each halogen forms
one normal covalent bond, and uses a lone pair to form a coordinate
bond (Figure 11.3c).

3, (BeMe,), has essentially the same structure as (BeCl3),, but the
bonding in the methyl compound is best regarded as three-centre two-
electron bonds covering one Me and two Be atoms.

4. A covalent lattice may be formed with a zinc blende or wurtzite struc-

ture (coordination number 4), for example by BeO and BeS.

In water beryllium salts are extensively hydrolysed to give a series of
hydroxo complexes of unknown structure. They may be polymeric and
of the type:

HO OH OH} [HO OH OH OH]?>
/ \ \ 7 \
Be Be Be Be Be

HO. OH OH HO OH OH OH

If alkali is added to these solutions the polymers break down to give the
simple mononuclear beryllate ion [Be(OH),]?~, which is tetrahedral.
Many beryllium salts contain the hydrated ion [Be(H2O),]** rather than
Be?*, and the hydrated ion too is a tetrahedral complex ion. Note that
the coordination number is 4. Forming a hydrated complex increases the
effective size of the beryllium ion, thus spreading the charge over a larger
area. Stable ionic salts such as [Be(H20),]SO,. [Be(H2O)4](NOs)2 and
{Be(H,0),JCl are known.
