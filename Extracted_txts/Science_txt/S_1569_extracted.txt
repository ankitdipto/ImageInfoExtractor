(GROUP 2 — THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS

 

Berylium salts are acidic when dissolved 1m pure water because the by

‘bond 1s very strong, and so in the hydrated son this weakens the O—I
‘bonds, and hence there isa tendency to lose protons ‘The nitial reaction

strongly with water, and do not hydrolyse apprectably

Beryllium salts rarely have more than four molecules of water of crystal
tization assocrated with the metal ton_because there are onty four orbitals
available in the second shell of electrons whereas magnesium can have

3p orbrtals

 

SOLUBILITY AND LATTICE ENERGY

‘The solubilay of most salts decreases vith increased atomic weight though
the usual trend 1s reversed withthe fluorides and hydroxides in thes group
Solubility depends on the lattice energy of the solid and the hydration
energy of the 1ons as explained below

Some lattice energy values for Group 2 compounds are listed in Table
117 The lattice energies are much higher than the values for Group 1
compounds because of the effect of the creased charge on the 1095 st
the Born-Lande equation (See Chapter 3) Taking any one particular
negative ion the lattice energy decreases as the size of the metal increases
