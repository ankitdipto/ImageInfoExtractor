“Magnesium has an antetmediate value, and st does not react with cold
water but t decomposes hot water

Mg + 2H,0—» Mj(OH), + Hz

Mg + H,0 + MgO + Hy

Mg forms a protective layer of oxide, so despite its favourable reduction
potential st does not react readily unless the oxide layer 1s removed by
amalgamating with mescury In the formation of the oxide film it resembles
alomuniom

‘HYDROXIDES

Be(OH); 1s amphoterte but the hydroxides of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba are
basic The basic strength increases from Mg to Ba, and Group 2 shows
