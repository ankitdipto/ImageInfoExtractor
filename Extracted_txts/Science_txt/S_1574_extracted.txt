CaCO; “5 CaO + CO,

MgO is not very reactive, especially if it has been ignited at high tem-
peratures, and for this reason it is used as a refractory. BeO is also used
as a refractory. They combine a number of properties that make them
useful for lining furnaces. These factors are:

1. High melting points (BeO approx. 2500°C, MgO approx. 2800°C).
2. Very low vapour pressures.

3, Very good conductors of heat.

4, Chemical inertness.

5, Electrical insulators.

All Be compounds should be used with care as they are toxic and dust or
smoke cause berylliosis.
CaO, SrO and BaO react exothermically with water, forming hydroxides.

CaO + H,0 - Ca(OH),

Mg(OH), is extremely insoluble in water (approx. 1 x 1074g1~! at 20°C)
but the other hydroxides are soluble and the solubility increases down the
group (Ca(OH), approx. 2g17'; Sr(OH)2 approx. 8g1~'; Ba(OH), ap-
prox. 39g1~'), Be(OH), is soluble in solutions containing an excess of
OH”, and is therefore amphoteric. Mg(OH), is weakly basic, and is used
to treat acid indigestion. The other hydroxides are strong bases. Ca(OH),
is called slaked lime.

BeO is covalent and has a 4: 4 zinc sulphide (wurtzite) structure, but all
the others are ionic and have a 6:6 sodium chloride structure.

Attempts to predict the structure using the sizes of the ions and the
radius tatio are only partly successful (Table 11.10). The correct structure
is predicted for BeO, MgO and CaO, but for SrO and BaO the predicted
coordination number is 8, though the structures found are six-coordinate.
Crystals adopt the structure that has the most favourable lattice energy,
and the failure of the radius ratio concept in this case leads us to examine
the assumptions on which it is based. (See Chapter 3 under ‘A more criti-
cal look at radius ratios’.) Ionic radii are not known with great accuracy
and they change with-different coordination numbers. Also, ions are not
Necessarily spherical, or inelastic.
