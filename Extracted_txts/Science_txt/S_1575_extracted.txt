“GROUP 2 — THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS

 

As the atoms get larger. the tonization energy decreases and the e
cements also become more basic BeO 1s insoluble im water but disoes
an acids (0 give salts and in alkalis 10 give beryllates which on standing
precipitate as the hydroxide BeO 1s therefore amphoteric MgO rests
‘with water, forming Mg(OH)» which 1s weakly basic CaO reacts vety
feadily wath water, evolving a lot of heat and forming Ca(OH) which 8@
moderately strong base S:(OH)> and Ba(OH); are even stronger bats
‘The oxides are usually prepared by thermal decomposition ofthe earban
ates nitrates or hydroxides ‘The merease in basic strength is llustrated by
the temperatures at which the carbonates decompose

BeCOr MgO, CaCO, SCO, BaCO,
<100°C 540°C 900°C 129°C 1360°C

‘The carbonates are all tome but BeCOs 1s unusual because it contlts
the hydrated jon [Be(14s0),"* rather than Be™*

CaCO occurs as two different crystalline forms calate and aragonté
Both forms occur naturally as minerals. Calcite 1s the more stable eth
Ca¥ 1s surrounded by six oxygen atoms from COR" rons Acagoailé
15 a metastable form, and its standard enthalpy of formation 1 about
SkJmol"! higher than that of calcite In prneiple aragomte should &
compose to calcite but a high energy of activation prevents this happe®
ang Aragonite can be made i the laboratory by preeiprtating from a Bot
solution Its crystal structure has Ca?* surrounded by mune oxygen atoms
‘This 8 a rather unusual coordination number

Calesum oxide (hie) ss prepared on a large scale (127 9 milhon toni

Lime is used

{In steel making to remove phosphates and silicates as slag

By moxing with S10y and alumuna or clay to make cement

For making glass

In the hme-soda process. which 15 part of the chlor-atkal ndust
converting Na;COs to NaOH oF vice versa

For ‘softening’ water

To make CaCy

‘To make slaked lime Ca(OH), by treatment with water

Bleaching powder is made by passing Cly into slaked hime, and 2000
150000 tonnes a year are produced Though bleaching powder 1s oft
watten as Ca(OC); 1s really a mxture

3Ca(OH): + 2C: > Ca(OC); Ca(OH): CaCk, 24,0

Soda lime 1s a mixture of NaOH and Ca(OH)s and ss made from qutt

lume (CaO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide It much easier to hantle
