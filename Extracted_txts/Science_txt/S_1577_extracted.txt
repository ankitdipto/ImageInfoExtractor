(GROUP? — THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS 1

 

BaSO, + 4C + BaS + 4CO

Group 11 elements also form perchlorates MCIOx which have very
sammlar structures 10 the sulphates, and the CiOz 10m 1s tetrahedral and
sumular in size to the SO” ton However, they differ chemically, since
perchlorates are strong oxidizing agents Magnesium perchlorate 1s used
fs a dying agent called anhydrone Anhydrone should not be used with
forganie materials because st 1s a strong oxidizing agent. and accidental
contact with organte matersal could cause an explosion

 

NITRATES

Nitrates of the metals can all be prepared 1n solution and can be crystal
Iized as hydrated salts by the reaction of HNO, with carbonates, oxdes
or hydroxides Heating the hydrated solids does not give the anhydross
rutrate because the sohd decomposes to the oxide Anhydrous mitrates c2m
bbe prepared using liquid dinitrogen tetroxide and ethyl acetate Beryihum™
1s unusual sm that it forms a basic nitrate an addition to the normal salt

Basic beryltium mirate 1S covalent and has an unsua! structure (Figuft

NOF groups along the six edges of the tetrahedron, and the (basic) oxY

molecules (ef baste berylhum acetate (Figure 11 5 b)). The structure
siko of interest because the NO¥ groups act as bidentate ligands in fort
ing a fidge between two Be atoms (See Chelates' im Chapter 7 for #
discussion of multidentate groups )

 

HYDRIDES.
