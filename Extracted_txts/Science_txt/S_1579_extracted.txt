neighbours and recewves a share mm their electrons Clustering i mportart

halides of the second and third row transition metals (Chapter 18)

HALIDES

Halides MXz can be made by heating the metals with the halogen or by
the action of halogen acid on either the metat or the carbonate The bent
tuum halides are covatent, hygroscopic and fume 1n air duc to hydrolysis
‘They sublime, and they do not conduct electricity Anhydrous berytham,
hralides cannot be obtained from matenals made 1m aqueous solutions

cannot be obtained by dehydrating hydrates (See Chapter 16 )

to one beryllium atom uses a lone parr of electrons to form a coordinate
bond to another beryliium atom
