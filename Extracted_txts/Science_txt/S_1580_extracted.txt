Beryllium fluoride is very soluble in water, owing to the high solvation
energy of Be in forming [Be(H20),]°*. The other fluorides MF; are all
almost insoluble.

Fluorides of the other metals are ionic, have high melting points, and
are insoluble in water. CaF, is a white, insoluble, high melting solid. It is
very important industrially, and is the main source of both F, and HF.

CaF, + H,SO,—> 2HF + CaSO,

HF + KF > KHF, electrolysis. F,
World production of fluorite CaF, was 3.6 million tonnes in 1992. The
main sources are China 42%, the Soviet Union, Mexico and Mongolia
8% each, and South Africa 7%. CaF, is also used to make prisms and
cell windows for spectrophotometers.

The chlorides, bromides and iodides of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba are ionic,
have much lower melting points than the fluorides, and are readily soluble
in water. The solubility decreases somewhat with increasing atomic num-
ber. The halides all form hydrates, and they are hygroscopic (absorb water
vapour from the air). Several million tonnes of CaCl, are produced each
year. Large amounts are discarded in solution as a waste product from the
Solvay process because it is not economic to recover the solid and demand
is low. CaCl, is widely used for treating ice on roads, particularly in very
cold countries, because a 30% eutectic mixture of CaCl,/HO freezes at
~55°C, compared with NaCl/H2O at —18°C. CaCl, is also used to make
concrete set more quickly and to improve its strength, and as ‘brine’ in
refrigeration plants. A minor use is in laboratories as a desiccant (dry-
ing agent). Anhydrous MgCl, is important in the electrolytic method for
extracting magnesium.

NITRIDES

The alkaline earth elements all burn in dinitrogen and form ionic nitrides
M:N>, This is in contrast to Group I where Li3N is the only nitride formed.

3Ca + N2 > Ca3N2

Because the Nz molecule is very stable, it requires a lot of energy to con-
tow into N*~ nitride ions. The large amount of energy required comes
solid is f very large amount of lattice energy evolved when the crystalline
charges lormed. The lattice energy is particularly high because of the high
nite on the ions M?* and N®~. Li is alone in Group I in forming a

cova? Is rather volatile in accord with the greater tendency of Be to
crystal Y, Dut the other nitrides are not volatile. All the nitrides are all

ine solids which decompose on heating and react with water, lib-

“rating ammonia and forming either the metal oxide or hydroxide, e.g.
Ca;Nz + 6H,O — 3Ca(OH), + 2NH3
