GROUP 2 — THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS j

CARBIDES (see sls0 Chapter 13)

‘When BeO 1s hexted with C at 190-2008°C a brick red coloured carbide
of formula Be-C formed ‘This sonic and hasan an fluorite strcture
Te like the CaF, structure except shat the positions ofthe metal ons an
Simons are mterchanged Its unusu'l because reacts with water forming
‘methane and 1s thus called a methanide

BexC + 41,0 -» 2Be(OH): + CH,

Group 2 metals typically form sone carbides of formula MC The
metals Mg Ca Sr and Ba form carbides of formula MC, enter when the
metal is heated with carbon in an electne furnace or when their oxides ate
heated with carbon CaC> made in this way 1s a grey coloured sold buts
colourless when pure BeC> 1s made by heating Be with ethyne

On heating MgC> changes into MgsCy This contains Ci and t reacts
wath water to form propyne CH\C==CH (methyl acetylene)

ca + 2c"S cacy

‘The MCs carbides all have 1 distorted sodwm chloride type of structure
IM" replaces Na* and C=C’ replaces CI” The C}_ tons are elongated
rot spherical ike Cl Thus the axis along which the C3" rons le wfength
ened compared with the other two axes and this 1s called tetragonal dis
tortion The structure 1s shown in Chapter 3 Figure 3 12 At temperatures
above 450°C the C2~ tons adopt random positions rather than being
‘aligned 1n this way and the unit cell them becomes cube rather than
tetrnponal

Calcium carbide 1s the best known It reacts with water liberating
‘thyne (lormerly called acetylene) and 1s thus called an acetyhide

CaCs + 2H.O + Ca(OH): + GH

At one time this reaction was the main source of ethyne for oxy acetylene
welding Production of CaC peaked at 7 million tonnes/year in 1960 but
had declined to 4 9 mullion tonnes in 1991 because ethyne ts now obtaned
from processing oft

CaCy 1s an emportant cherncal intermediate. When CaCa 1s heated 29
¢lectni furnace with atmosphene dinitrogen at 1100°C, calcium eyanamse
CaNCN 1s formed ‘This is an important reaction because rt 1s one method
of fixing atmosphere dinitrogen (The Haber process for NH is another
method of fixing dinitrogen )

CAC; + Nr CANCN + C

‘The eyanamide 1on [N=C==N]* 15 soelectronse with CO, and has he
same linear structure CaNCN 1s produced on a large scale, pariclaly
Jocations where there 1S cheap electncity At one time about 13 milion
tonnes/year was produced though this 3s now iereasng Cyanamde
