widely used (particularly in SE Asia and the Far East) as a slow acting

nitrogenous fertilizer, as it hydrolyses slowly over a period of months.

CaNCN has the advantage over more soluble nitrogenous fertilizers such

as NH,NO; or urea, in that it is not washed away with the first rainstorm.
CaNCN + 5H20 - CaCO; + 2NH,OH

Other important industrial uses of CaNCN are the manufacture of cyan-
amide H,NCN which is used to make urea and thiourea, and of melamine
which forms hard plastics with formaldehyde.

It is interesting that BaC, also reacts with N2, but it forms a cyanide

INSOLUBLE SALTS

The sulphates of calcium, strontium and barium are insoluble, and the
carbonates, oxalates, chromates and fluorides of the whole group are
insoluble. This is a useful factor in qualitative analysis.

ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS

Poth Be and Mg form an appreciable number of compounds with M—C
ends, but only a few have been isolated for Ca, Sr and Ba.
Die Grignard, a Frenchman, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
Gri ar his work on organomagnesium compounds which are now called
organi Teagents. These are probably the most versatile reagents in
alten ety: and can be used to make a wide variety of alcohols,
of on les, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides and alkenes. The use
or maar Teagents and lithium alkyls provide the two general methods
are ver Ing organometallic compounds, and hence Grignard compounds
'Y Mmportant in inorganic chemistry too.
