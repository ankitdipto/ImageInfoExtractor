Grignard reagents are made by the slow addition of an alkyl or aryl
halle (Cl. Br or 1) 10.9 continuously stirred mixture of magnesium tra
ings in an absolutely dry organic solvent such as diethyl ether Water
‘and air must be ngorously excluded The reaction often has an induction
period before 1 starts, and may require the addition of a crystal of iodine
to penetrate the onde film on the metal to make it start Very reactive
‘magnesium can be prepared by reducing magnesium halides with potass
sum in the presence of KI. and the use of this makes st easter to prepare
Grignard reagents, and extends their uses

Mg + RB Gg RMaBe (R= alkyl or ary)
Grignard reagents are all very reactive lodides are the most reacuve, and
chlorides the least reactive Alkyl Grignard compounds are usualy mort
reactive than ary) Grignard compounds

All Grignard reagents are rapidly hydrolysed by water to gwve the pare

hydrocarbon

2RMgBr + 2H, — 2RH + Mg(OH); + MgBry
Grignard reagents are not stored, but are made and used when required
‘without isolating them “They are normally solvated or polymerized with
halogen bridges. Their structures have long been the subject of contr
versy X-ray structures of solid PhMgBr 2E1;0 and EtMgBr 2E;O sho

group. and oxygen atoms from ether molecules. but in solution sever!
