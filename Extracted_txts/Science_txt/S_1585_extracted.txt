Beryllium fluoride BeF; readily coordinates two extra F~ ions, fom-
ing the [BeF,}*~ complex. The tetrafluoroberyllates M;[BeF) are nell
known complex ions, and resemble the sulphates in properties. In mos
cases beryliium is four-coordinate in complexes and the tetrahedral a-
rangement adopted correlates with the orbitals avanlable for complex
formation.

In a similar way complexes of the type BeCl, Ds are formed (where D

 

isan ether. aldehyde oF ketone with an oxygen atom which has alone pt
‘of electrons that can be donated). These complexes, like [Be(H,0).)"
are tetrahedral.

Many stable chelate complexes of Be are known. including beryllum
‘oxalate [Be(ox):)'~. with P-diketones such as acetylacetone, and with
catechol. In all of these the Be? son is tetrahedrally coordinated (se
Figure 11.56).
