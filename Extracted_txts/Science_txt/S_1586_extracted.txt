group, and it is the same as the structure of basic beryllium nitrate (Figure
11.1b). Basic beryllium acetate is soluble in organic solvents. It is covalent,
and thus has a fairly low melting point (285°C) and boiling point (330°C).
These are low enough for it to be distilled, which is useful in the purifica-
tion of beryllium.

Be compounds are said to taste sweet, but do not test this for yourself as
they are extremely toxic. This is due to their very high solubility and their
ability to form complexes with enzymes in the body. Be displaces Mg from
some enzymes because it has a stronger complexing ability. Contact with
the skin causes dermatitis, and inhaling dust or smoke causes a disease
called berylliosis which is rather like silicosis.

Magnesium forms a few halide complexes such as [NEt,]2[MgCl.], but
Ca, Sr and Ba do not.

From the viewpoint of life on this planet the most important complex
formed by magnesium is chlorophyll. The magnesium is at the centre of
a flat heterocyclic organic ring system called a porphyrin, in which four
Nitrogen atoms are bonded to the magnesium (see Figure 11.6). Chlo-
tophyll is the green pigment in plants which absorbs light in the red region
from sunlight, and makes the energy available for-photosynthesis. In this
Process CO, is converted into sugars.

Almost all life ultimately depends on chlorophyll and photosynthesis. The
dioxygen in the atmosphere is a by-product of photosynthesis, and food-
stuffs are either parts of plants, or animals which feed on plants. Though
Photosynthesis is commonly associated with higher plants, about half
actually occurs in algae, and certain green, brown, red and purple bac-
