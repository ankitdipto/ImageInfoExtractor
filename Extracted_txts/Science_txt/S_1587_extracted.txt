teria, The photosynthetic bacteria are anaerobic and are poisoned by O;.
“These bacteria oxidize H,S to S, or oxidize an organic molecule instead of
the usual reaction where HO is oxidized to O3.

Calcium and the rest ofthe group only form complexes with strong con-
plexingagents Examplesinclude acetylacetone,CHy-CO-CH,-CO-CHy
{Qwhich has two donor oxygen atoms), and ethylenediamnctetraacetic ail,
EDTA, which has four donor oxygen atoms and two donor nitrogen ators
im each molecule. The free acid H,EDTA is msotuble, and the disoduum
salt NagH,EDTA is the most used reagent.

EDTA will form six-coordinate complexes with most metal ions ia
solution provided that the pH is suitably adjusted. Since Be is invariably
{our-coordinate it does not complex appreciably with EDTA. In conta!
caleiym ond magnesium complex with EDTA, and titrations are pet
formed using EDTA in buffered solutions to estimate the amounts of
Ca®* and Mg? present to determine the ‘hardness’ of the water. EDTA
