(GROUP 2 ~ THE ALKALINE EARTH ELEMENTS:

 

9 Be salts are extenswely hydrolysed

10 Be salts are among the most soluble known

11. Berylhum forms an unusual carbide BezC, which ike ALC yields
methane on hydrolysis

“There 1s plainly a diagonal simulanty between berylhum in Group Il and
alumitum in Group TIE Just as was the case with thru and magnesium
the similanty an atomic and tonte sizes 1s the main factor underlying ths
relationship

PROBLEMS
1. Why are Group 11 elements smalier than thext Group I counterparts”

2. Why are Group If metals harder and why do they have higher melting
points than Group I metals?

3 What 1s the reason why compounds of Be are much more covalent
than other Group II compounds?

4 Whats the structure of BeCl, in the gaseous state and as a solid”
Why is BeCI acidi. when dissolved 1n water?

5. Deseribe the difference mn structure between BeH, and CaHs
6 Why do the halides and hydndes of Be polymerize?
