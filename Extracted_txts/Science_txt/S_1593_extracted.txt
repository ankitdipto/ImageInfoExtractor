GENERAL PROPERTIES

Boron is a non-metal, and always forms covalent bonds. Normally it forms
three covalent bonds at 120° using sp? hybrid orbitals. There is no
tendency to form univalent compounds. All BX3 compounds are electron
deficient, and may accept an electron pair from another atom, thus forming
acoordinate bond. BF; is commercially important as a catalyst. Boron also
forms a large number of compounds in which the boron atoms form an
open basket type of structuré, and some which are a closed polyhedron.
Other atoms such as carbon may be included in the polyhedron. The
bonding in these compounds is of considerable theoretical interest, and
involves multi-centre bonds.

ae elements Al, Ga, In and TI all form trivalent compounds. The
become members show the ‘inert pair effect’, and univalent compounds
dlements (Tate ee mporeant in the order Ga > In — TI. These four
moderate Table 12.1) are more metallic, and more ionic, than B. They are
between i Teactive metals. Their compounds are on the borderline
anhvd nic and covalent. Many of their compounds are covalent when

'ydrous, but they form ions in solution.
