OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE

Boron 1s 2 farrly rare element, but it 1 well hnown because (tcccts
1s concentrated deposits of borax Nas{B,Os(OH),) 81,0 and kernte
Nay[B,O«(OH),) 2H3O The largest deposits are im the Moyave desert
(in Calforma), and in Death Valley (in Utah) These are desert regions
‘Over a fong period of time, any rain has leached these alkaline salts (em
the hills nto lakes in the valleys. These lakes have tong since dned 1p
leaving solid deposits on the surface from 10 to 50 metres deep The
amount of crude borate minerals mined in 1993 ~ was 5 3 milion tones
The largest producers are the Soviet Union 53%, and the USA ad
Turkey 19% each

‘Aluminium 3s the most abundant metal, and the third most abundst
clement (after oxygen and sficon) by weight in in the earth's cust 1
well known and is commercially rmportant Aluminum metals product
fon a vast scale Primary production was 19 4 millon tonnes an 1992, ad
an additional § milion tonnes ts recycled The most important ore of
aluminum 38 bauxite This ws @ generic name for several manerals wi
formulae varying between ALO; H,O and ALO; 3H,0 Wold prods
tion of bauxite was 108 6 millon tonnes in 1992 Alumunium also occurs
large amounts im aluminostheate rocks such as feldspars, and micas When
these rocks weather they form clay minerals or other metamorphue rocks
‘There 1 no easy or economical method of extracting alumansum from
feldspars, micas or clays

smuch less common All three efements, Ga, In and TI, occur as sulphides
Ga, In and Ti are not very well known This ss partly because they do #0"

tostan the periodic table (AL, Zn and Ge) Traces of In and Tiare found
ZnS and POS ores. Production of In was 145 tonnes, Ga 28 tonnes, 9°
Te 145 tonnes in 1993
