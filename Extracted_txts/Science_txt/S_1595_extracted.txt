It is difficult to obtain pure crystalline boron, as it has a very high melting
point (2180°C), and the liquid is corrosive. Small amounts of crystalline
boron may be obtained:

1. By reducing BCI, with H2. This is done on the kilogram scale.

2. Pyrolysis of BI; (Van Arkel method).

3. Thermal decomposition of diborane or other boron hydrides.

Uses of boron

An important use of boron is to make boron steel or boron carbide control
rods for nuclear reactors. Boron has a very high cross-section for capturing
neutrons. Control rods made of boron steel or boron carbide may be
lowered into a reactor to absorb neutrons and thus slow the reactor down.
Boron carbide is also used as an abrasive. Boron is used to make impact
Tesistant steel, as it increases the hardenability (that is the depth to which it
will harden) of steel.

Borax Na;[B,0;(OH),]-8H2O, orthoboric acid H3;BO3 and boron
Sesquioxide BO; find many uses. The most important uses are making
fibreglass for insulation and textiles (50% of use in USA) and perborates for
detergents (35% in Europe). World production of borax was roughly 2.2
niillion tonnes in 1992 (USA 45%, Turkey 42%). Borax is used as a flame
retardant for fabric and wood, and mixed with NaOH and sold as ‘Polybor’
ue ‘Timbor’ for treating timber and hardboard against attack by wood-
me insects, Borax is used as a flux in brazing and in silver soldering.
