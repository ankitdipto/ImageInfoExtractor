borate It 1s used less in the USA World production 1s $50000 tonnes!
year Peroxoborates act as bnghteners, because they absorb UV light and
‘emit visible light This makes both white and coloured fabrics appeat
extra bright If used at temperatures over 80°C, peroxoborates decompost
to hydrogen peroxide H;O;, which acts as a bleach

Boron sesquioxide BOs 1s used m making borosiicate (heat rest!)
glass (eg Pyrex which contains 14% B,Ox) Borosilicate glass hes a loxer
coefficient of thermal expansion and 1s easter to work than normal ‘sod
glass’ HyBOy, BO, and calewum borate are used to make soda-free gis
fibre, which 1s used for thermal insulation in houses

Extraction of aluminium

‘Aluminium 1s obtained from the ore bauxite which may be AIO OH
(AkO; 1,0) or Al(OH); (ALOx 3H;0) One hundred and eight milion
tonnes were mined in 1992 The largest sources are Australia 37%, Gut
15%, Jamaica 10% and Brazil 9%

‘The first step 1s to punfy the ore In the Bayer process, waste matends
(mainly 1ron and siicon compounds) are removed because these would
spoil the properties of the product NaOH is added to the ore, and as AIS
amphotenc it dissolves forming sodium aluminate SiOz also dissolves #8
silicate tons Any insoluble waste materials, particularly 1ron oxide, até
removed by fitering Next aluminium hydroxide ss precipitated from iit
strongly alkaline aluminate solution This may be done either by bubblet
an some COs (an acidic oxide which lowers the pH), or by seeding tte
solution with AlOx The silicate rons remain in solution The AKOW):
precipitate 1 calcined (heated strongly) which converts to porte
ALOs

Aluminum ss usually extracted by the Hall-Héroult process Al,0s

the melting point of the mixture to about 950°C Other smpurtties such
CaF, and AIF, may aso be added (A typral electrolyte mature 1 &5%
NalAIFe}, 5% CaF;, 5% AIF; and 5% Al;O, ) Various products
formed at the anodes, including Oz, COz, F3 and earbon compounds
fluorine These erode the anodes, which must be replaced periodical!
