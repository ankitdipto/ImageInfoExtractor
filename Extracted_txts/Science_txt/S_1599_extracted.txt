 

OXIDATIONS STATES AND TYPE OF BONDS

This exceeds the ionization energy, so AICI; ionizes in solution.

The hydrated metal ions have six molecules of water which are held very
strongly in an octahedral structure [M(H20),}**. The metal-oxygen
bonds are very strong. This weakens the O—H bonds, and protons are
released to neighbouring water molecules, forming H;O* (hydrolysis).

H,0 + [M(H20)«}* ~ [M(H,0)s(OH)?* + H,O*

The (+1) oxidation state — the ‘inert pair effect’

In the s-block, Group 1 elements are univalent, and Group 2 elements are
divalent. In Group 13 we would expect the elements to be trivalent. In
most of their compounds this is the case, but some of the elements show
lower valency states as well. There is an increasing tendency to form
univalent compounds on descending the group. Compounds with Ga(l),
In(1) and TI(1) are known. With Ga and In the (+1) oxidation state is less
stable than the (+III) state. However, the stability of the lower oxidation
state increases on descending the group. TI(I) thallous compounds are
more stable than TI(IH]) thallic compounds.

How and why does monovalency occur? The atoms in this group have an
outer electronic configuration of s*p', Monovalency is explained by the s
electrons in the outer shell remaining paired, and not participating in
bonding. This is called the ‘inert pair effect’. If the energy required to
unpair them exceeds the energy evolved when they form bonds, then the s
electrons will remain paired. The strength of the bonds in MX; compounds
decreases down the group. The mean bond energy for chlorides are
GaCl, = 242, InCl, = 206 and TICI, = 153k mol~!. Thus the s electrons
are most likely to be inert in thallium.

The inert pair effect is not the explanation of why monovalency occurs in
Group 13. It merely describes what happens, i.e. two electrons do not
Participate in bonding. The reason that they do not take part in bonding is
energy. The univalent ions are much larger than the trivalent ions, and
(+1 compounds are ionic, and are similar in many ways to Group 1
elements.

The inert pair effect is not restricted to Group 13, but also occurs among
the heavier elements in other groups in the p-block. Examples from Group
14 are Sn?* and Pb?*, and examples from Group 15 are Sb>* and Bi?*.
The lower oxidation state becomes more stable on descending the group.
Thus Sn?* is a reducing agent but Pb2* is stable and Sb** is a reducing
agent but Bi>* is stable. When the s electrons remain paired, the oxidation
State is always two lower than the usual oxidation state for the group.

_ Thusin the s-block, Groups 1 and 2 show only the group valency. Groups

in the p-block show variable valency, differing in steps of two. Variable

valency also occurs with elements in the d-block. This arises from using

ditferent numbers of d electrons for bonding, so in this case the valency can
nge in steps of one (e.g. Cut and Cu?*, Fe2* and Fe?*),
