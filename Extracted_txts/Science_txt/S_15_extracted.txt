* Living things are highly organized, whether as single
cells or as multicellular organisms, with several hier-
archical levels.

1.2 Scientists form generalizations from observations.

of living things?

* Science is the determination of general principles
from observation and experimentation.

* Scientists select the best hypotheses by using
controlled experiments to eliminate alternative
hypotheses that are inconsistent with observations.

* A group of related hypotheses supported by a large
body of evidence is called a theory. In science, a
theory represents what we are most sure about.
However, there are no absolute truths in science, and
even theories are accepted only conditionally.

* Scientists conduct basic research, designed to gain
information about natural phenomena in order to
contribute to our overall body of knowledge, and
applied research, devoted to solving specific problems
with practical applications.

2. What is the difference be-
tween deductive and inductive
reasoning? What is a hypothesis?

3. What are variables? How are
control experiments used in test-
ing hypotheses?

4. How does a hypothesis
become a theory? At what point
does a theory become accepted
as an absolute truth, no longer
subject to any uncertainty?

5. What is the difference
between basic and applied
research?

1.3. Darwin’s theory of evolution illustrates how science works.

© One of the central theories of biology is Darwin’s
theory that evolution occurs by natural selection. It
states that certain individuals have heritable traits that
allow them to produce more offspring in a given kind
of environment than other individuals lacking those
traits. Consequently, those traits will increase in
frequency through time.

¢ Because environments differ in their requirements
and opportunities, the traits favored by natural
selection will vary in different environments.

* This theory is supported by a wealth of evidence ac-
quired over more than a century of testing and
questioning.

6. Describe the evidence that led
Darwin to propose that evolu-
tion occurs by means of natural
selection. What evidence
gathered since the publication of
Darwin’s theory has lent further
support to the theory?

7. What is the difference be-
tween homologous and analo-
gous structures? Give an

example of each.

* Biological diversity is the result of a long history of
evolutionary change. For this reason evolution is the
core of the science of biology.

* Considered in terms of levels-of-organization, the
science of biology can be said to consist of subdisci-
plines focusing on particular levels. Thus one speaks
of molecular biology, cell biology, organismal biolo-
gy, population biology, and community biology.

tives to levels-of-organization as
ways of organizing the mass of
information in biology?
