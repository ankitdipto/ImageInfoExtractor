‘The large difference m size between B and Al results m many differences
tn properties Thus B isa non metal has avery high melting point, always
forms covalent bonds. and forms an acidic oxide In contrast, Alisa metal
has a much lower melting point, and its oxide ts amphoteric (Its safe 0
‘generalize in this way, but unsafe to argue quantitatively that AP* 1s twice
the size of B™ or that the metathe radn differ by a factor of 1 6 as BY

ELECTROPOSITIVE CHARACTFR

“The clectroposiuve or metallic nature of the elements snereases from B
to Al, but then decreases from Al to Tl This 1s shown by the standard
electrode potentials forthe reaction
