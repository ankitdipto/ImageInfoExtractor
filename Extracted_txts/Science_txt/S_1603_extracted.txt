\ The standard electrode potentials E° for M°*|M become less negative
from Al to Ga to In and the potential becomes positive for Tl. Since
AG = —nFE° it follows that AG, the free energy of formation of the
metal, e.g. AP* + 3e > Al, is positive. Thus it is difficult to make this
reaction work. (The reverse reaction Al Al* + 3e occurs sponta-
neously.) The standard potential becomes less negative on descending the
group so it becomes less difficult for the reaction M°* — M to occur. Thus
the (+III) oxidation state becomes less stable in aqueous solution on
descending the group. In a similar way, the E° values for M*|M show that
the (+I) state increases in stability. With TI, the (+1) state is more stable
than the (+III) state.

It should be remembered that in this type of argument E° and AG
refer to the reaction with Hy:

AB* + 3H,— Al + 3H*

IONIZATION ENERGY

The ionization energies increase as expected (first ionization energy <
second ionization energy < third ionization energy). The sum of the first
three ionization energies for each of the elements is very high. Thus boron
