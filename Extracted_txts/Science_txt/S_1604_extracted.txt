unde

has no tendency to form 1ons, and always forms covalent bonds The other
elements normally form covatent compounds except in solution

‘The ronization energy values do not decrease smoothly down the group
‘The decrease from B to Al is the usual trend on descending a group
associated with increased size The poor shielding by d electrons and the
resulting d-block contraction affect the values forthe later elements

REACTIONS OF BORON

Pure crystalhne boron is very unteactie However, 115 attacked at high
temperatures by strong oxidizing agents such as a mixture of hot con-
czntrated H;SO, and HINOs, or by sodium peronde In contrast, Gnely
dvvaded amorphous boron (which contains between 2% and 5% of im-
punties)s more reactive Tt burasin aur or doxygen, forming the oxde Tt
also burns at white heat un dinitrogen, forming the mitade BN This 1s @
slippery white sold with 2 layer structure simular to graphite Boron also
bums in the halogens, forming trhalides It reacts directly wth many
elements, forming borides, which are hard and refractory It reduces
strong HNO} and H;S0, slowly, and also iberates H, from fused NaOH
