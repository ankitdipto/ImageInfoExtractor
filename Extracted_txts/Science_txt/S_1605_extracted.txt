TH+ hoTM [b> * thallium(I) tritodide formed
2M + 6HCI—> 2MCl; + 3H All react with dilute mineral acids, Al
1 passivated by HNO; particularly when
‘ concentrated

Al+NaOH + H,0— NaAlO, +H, Aland Ga only
‘  NasAlO3 + Hp

 

M+NH3— MNH2 All the metals form amides

 

reason is that a very thin oxide film forms on the surface and protects the
metal from further attack. This layer is only 10~* to 107° mm thick. If the
protective oxide! covering is removed, for example by amalgamating with
mercury, then the metal readily decomposes cold water, forming Al,03
and liberating hydrogen.

Aluminium articles are often ‘anodized’ to give a decorative finish. This
is done by electrolysing dilute H2SO, with the aluminium as the anode.
This produces a much thicker layer of oxide on the surface (10~? mm). This
layer can take up pigments, thus colouring the aluminium.

Aluminium burns in dinitrogen at high temperatures, forming AIN. The
other elements do not react. ‘

Reaction with acids and alkalis
Aluminium dissolves in dilute mineral acids liberating hydrogen.
. 2Al + 6HCI > 2AP* + 6CI- + 3H,

However, concentrated HNO3 renders the metal passive because it is an
oxidizing agent, and produces a protective layer of oxide on the surface.
Aluminium also dissolves in aqueous NaOH (and is therefore amphoteric),

liberating hydrogen and forming aluminates. (The nature of aluminates is
discussed later.)

‘2Al + 2NaOH + 6H,0 — 2NaAl(OH), or (2NaAIO,-2H,O) + 3H2
