Reaction with dioxygen

Aluminwuen burns readily 1n air or dioxygen, and the reaction is strongly
‘exothermic This 1s known as the Thermute reaction

2A) + JOrq) > ALOuy + energy AH* = ~1670%

‘The Thermute reaction evolves so much energy that at can be dangerous
‘The alumunum becomes white hot, and often causes fires For this precise
reason moxtures of Al and an oxide such a8 FeO, oF 8:02 (to provide
the oxygen) were used to make incendiary bombs during World War I
‘Warships are sometimes made of alumniquum alloys to reduce their weight
A thermute reaction can be started ifthe ship ts bit by a musile Such fires
‘on ships caused considerable casualties in the Falklands Islands confict
‘The very strong affinny of Al for oxygen 25 used in the metallurgical
‘extraction of other metals from their oxides

BAL + 3MmO,—+ 41,0, + 9Ma
2AL + C103 Al,Ox + 2Cr

Reacston with the halogens and sulphate

‘Aluminium reacts with the halogens quite readhly, even when cold,
forming trhalides

Alumunum sulphate ts used in large amounts (3 7 milion tonnes 1m
1991) Itus made by treating bauxite with H;SO, Its used as @ coagulant
and preeiptant m treating both drinking water and sewage Its also used
1 the paper industry, and as a mordant in dyeing

Alums

Aluminium tons may crystallize from aqueous solutions, forming double
salts These are called chum alums and have the general formula
[M'(20),[AN(H;0),(SO.):. M! 1s a singly charged cation such as Na*
K* or NHi The crystals ate usualy large octahedra, and ate extremely
pure Punty as especrally important 1a some applications Potash alum

application Al™* 1s precipitated as AKOH), on cloth to help the dyes bind
10 the cloth as alumimum complexes. It i essential that Fe** 1s absent
tm order to obtain the ‘true’ bright colours Double salts break up in
solution. into their constituent 1ons Crystals are made up of [M(H,O}e)"«
{[Al(1,0),)"* and two $07 tons The 1ons are simply the tight size and
charge to crystallize together Some M'* 1ons other than AI" also form
alums of formula (M'CH,O),IIM™(H;0),|(SO3)2. The most common tt
valent tons are Fe'* and Cr'*, but others melude Ti'*. V*, Mn"
