Orthoboric acid H3BOs is soluble in water, and behaves as a weak
monobasic acid. It does’ not donate protons like most acids, but rather it
accepts OH™. It is therefore a Lewis acid, and is better written as B(OH)s.

Acidic properties of H3BO3 or B(OH)3

Since B(OH); only partially reacts with water to form H30* and
[B(OH).\-, it behaves as a weak acid. Thus H3BO; or (B(OH)s) cannot be
titrated satisfactorily with NaOH, as a sharp end point is not obtained. If
certain organic polyhydroxy compounds such as glycerol, mannitol or
sugars are added to the titration mixture, then B(OH) behaves as a strong
monobasic acid. It can now be titrated with NaOH, and the end point
