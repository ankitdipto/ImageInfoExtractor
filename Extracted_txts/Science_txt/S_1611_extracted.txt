Figure 12.3 Hydrogen bonded structure of orthoboric acid.

Mg;(BO3)2 and the lanthanide orthoborates Ln™BO3. In the metaborates
simple units (BO; planar triangular units or BO, tetrahedra) join together
to form a variety of polymeric chain and ring structures (see Figure 12.4).

Thus two triangular units join by sharing one corner in Mg2[B2Os] and
Co!'[B,0.]. These are called pyroborates by analogy with pyrophosphates.
Three triangular units share corners and form a ring in sodium and
potassium metaborates NaBO, and KBO, (Figure 12.4b) which are better
written Na3[B30¢] and K3[B3Q¢]. Many triangular units may polymerize
me : infinite chain, e.g. as calcium metaborate [Ca(BO2)2], (Figure

4a).

In a similar way discrete tetrahedral units are found in Na2[B(OH),]Cl
and TaYBO,. Two tetrahedra may join by sharing one corner, as in
Mg[(HO);B -O- B(OH)s]. Other structures form rings, chains, sheets and
three-dimensional polymers.

Some interesting structures including both triangular and tetrahedral
units are formed when polymerization occurs. The spiro compound
K[BsO,(OH),] (Figure 12.4c) contains one tetrahedral unit and four
triangular units. Borax is usually written as NajB,O; - 10H,O but is actually
made from two tetrahedra and two triangular units joined as shown
(Figure 12.4d) and should be written Naz[B,Os(OH),] - 8H,0.

Borax

The most common metaborate is borax Na2[B,O5(OH).]-8HO. It is a
useful primary standard for titrating against acids.
