Figure 124 Structures of some borates (a) Metaborate chain {Ca(BO,);], made
‘up of tnangular BOs units (b) Metaborate ning K,[B,04] made up of tnangular
BO, uns (c) Complex metaborate K[B,O,(OH),] ealled the spiro anion 1
‘made up of four tnangular BO, units and one tetrahedral BO, unit (@) Borax
(Nax{B.0,(OH),] 81,0) 1s made up of two trangular and two tetrahedral units
‘Ths ton (BAOYOH,| «nd the over water molecules are assisted mith he

(Nay{B,Os(OH),] 8,0) + 2HCI + 2NaCI + 4HyBO5 + SHO

One of the products HyBOs 1s itself a weak acid Thus the indicator used
to detect the end pomnt of this reaction must be one that 1s unaffected
by HBO; Methyl orange 1s normally used, which changes in the pH
range 3 1-44

‘One mole of borax reacts with two moles of acid. This because when
borax 1s dissolved in water both B(OH); and [B(OH),]~ are formed, but
only the (B(OH).J~ reacts with HCI
