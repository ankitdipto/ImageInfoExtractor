The last reaction will titrate at pH 9.2, so the indicator must have pK, <

ca. 8. Borax is also used as a buffer since its aqueous solution contains
equal amounts of weak acid and its salt.

Sodium peroxoborate

Large amounts of sodium peroxoborate are produced, and world produc-
tion is about 550000 tonnes/year. There are two main preparative
methods:,

1. Electrolysis of a solution of sodium borate (containing some NaCOs;).
2. By oxidizing boric acid or sodium metaborate with hydrogen peroxide.

peroxoborate ion

Sodium peroxoborate, is used as a brightener in washing powders. It is
compatible with enzymes which are added to some ‘biological’ powders. In

very hot water (over 80°C) the peroxide linkages O—O break down to
give H20>.

Isopolyacids of B, Si and P

Other elements form polymeric compounds similar to the borates; notably
Si forms silicates and P forms phosphates. These polymeric compounds are
called isopolyacids. (The name isopolyacid means that acidic ions are
polymerized together: Iso means ‘the same’, and indicates that only one
type of ion is involved. I£ two different types of ion polymerize together,
for example phosphate and molybdate ions, the phosphomolybdate
polymer is called a heteropolyacid.)

The principles underlying the structures of borates have been set out

by Christ and Clark (see Further Readi Th inci
summarized’as follows: ee ve

LB often forms triangular’ BO; units. Sometimes these remain mono-
y meric, but they may form polynuclear ions by sharing the O atoms at
Comers. This links the triangular units together into chains, rings and
