‘THE GROUP 13 ELEMENTS

 

 

3 Hydrated borates may accept protons ‘These are added in the following
order ()) O% rons are converted to OH™, (n) tetrahedral O are
protonated, (mn) the O in planar triangles are protonated and (Ww) any
free OH™ groups are converted to H;O

4 Hydrated borates may polymere by eliminating HzO This may be
followed by breaking or rearranging B—O bonds

5 HABO, often extsts in the presence of more complex polyanions.

‘These polymenc borate structures tend to break up when dissolved in
water

In contrast, the structures of phosphates and silicates are always based
fon tetrahedral PO, and SiO, units. ‘The tetrahedra may polymere snto
chains, rings and three-dimenstonal structures These structures are rather
more stable and do not break up in solution

‘Qualtauve analysis of boron compounds
‘When borates are treated with HE (or with concentrated H,S0, and CaF,)
the volatile compound BF; 1s formed If the BF, gas produced is snto-
duced into a flame (for example a Bunsen flame) the flame gaves a char-
actenstie green coloration

cone H,S0, + CaF; + 2HF + CaSO,

HyBO, + 3HF—+ 2BF, + 3H,0
‘An alternative test 18 to make the ester methyl borate B(OCH,): The
suspected borate sample 1s mmxed with concentrated H:S0, to form
HyBOs, and warmed with methyl alcohol ina small evaporating basin
B(OH), + 3CHOH + B(OCH,): + 3150

‘The concentrated H.SO, removes the water formed ‘The muxture 1s then
set on fire Methyl borate 1s volaule, and colours the flame green

Fluobontcacid
HyBO, dissolves in aqueous HF, forming Auoboric acid HBF,
HyBO) + 4HE + HY + [BF + 31,0

Fluobonte acid sa strong acid, and commercial solutions contain 40% actd
‘The [BF,]~ ton s tetrahedral and fluoborates resemble perchlorates CIO
and sulphates m crystal structure and solubshty (KCIO, and KBF. are both
not very soluble im water) The (BF,|” and (C1O,]~ tons have a very low
tendency to form complexes in aqueous sotution, though a few complexes
are formed in non-aqueous media

 

Bondes

‘There are over 21K) binary compounds between metals and boron These
‘are many different stoichtometnes The most common are M.B, MB.
