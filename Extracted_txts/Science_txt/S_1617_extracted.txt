AI(OH); 22228 NaAl(OH), sodium
NaAlO,-2H,O aluminate

The formula of aluminates is often written as NaAlO,-2H2O (which is
equivalent to [Al(OH).]~). Raman spectra suggest that the structure of the
aluminate ion is more complicated than this implies, and the structure
changes with both pH and concentration:

1, Between pH 8 and 12 the ions polymerize using OH bridges and each
aluminium is octahedrally coordinated.

2. In dilute solutions above pH values of 13, a tetrahedral [Al(OH)4]~ ion
exists.

3. In concentrated solutions above 1.5 M and at pH values greater than 13
the ion exists as a dimer: [(HO);Al—O—AI(OH)3]?—

Ga,O; and Ga(OH)3 are both amphoteric like the corresponding Al
compounds. Ga(OH)3 is white and gelatinous and dissolves in alkali,
forming gallates. Tl,O3 and InO; are completely basic, and form neither
hydrates nor hydroxides. In contrast, thallous hydroxide TIOH is a strong
base, and is soluble in water. Thus TIOH differs from the trivalent
hydroxides and resembles the Group 1 hydroxides. Where an element can
exist in more than one valency state, there is a general tendency for the
lowest valency state to be the most basic. .

Thallium(III) acetate and trifluoroacetate can be made by dissolving the
oxide in the appropriate acid. They are used in the synthesis of organo-
metallic thallium compounds. ’

TETRAHYDRIDOBORATES (BOROHYDRIDES)

Stable complexes containing the group [BH,]~ are well known. These
should be called tetrahydridoborates, though the old name borohydride is
still widely used. The tetrahydridoborate ion [BH,]~ is tetrahedral, and
the sodium salt Na[BH,] is the most important compound. It is usually

Prepared from trimethylborate. It is ionic, and has a sodium chloride
structure.

Other tetrahydridoborates are made by treating Na[BH,] with the appro-
priate metal chloride. The alkali metal tetrahydridoborates are white ionic
Solids and react with water with varying ease. Thus Li[BH] reacts violently
bi water, but Na[BH,) may be recrystallized from cold water with only
slight decomposition, and K[BHg] is quite stable.
