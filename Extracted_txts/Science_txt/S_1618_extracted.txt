aqueous solutions This makes it a useful reagent for reducing aldchydes to
primary alcohols, and ketones to secondary alcohols It 1s a nucleophile
reagent, and attacks sites of low electron density Thus other functional
‘groups such as C=C, COOH and NO; are not normally attacked

Not all tetrahydndoborates are tonic The beryllium, aluminum and
transition metal borohydrides become increasingly covalent and volatile
In these the (BH,|~ group acts as a tigand and forms covalent compounds
with metal ions One or more Hatomsin a [BH,]~ act as a bndge and bond
to the metal, forming a three-centre bond with two electrons shared by
three atoms ‘The [BH.]~ ligand as unosual in that xt may form one, two or
three such three centre bonds to the metal ion. Thus Be(BH,):, Al(BH)s
and Zr(BH4)4 are covalent, and react strongly with water In the Aland Zr
compounds, each BH; forms two hydrogen bridges, whilst in the Be
‘compound two of the three BHz form three hydrogen bridges
