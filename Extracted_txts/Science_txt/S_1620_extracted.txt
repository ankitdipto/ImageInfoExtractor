‘there would be one short bond and (wo longer ones However. all meas-
turements show thatthe three bond lengths are identical The old valence
‘bond explanation of this was resonance between three structures with
the double bond in different positions “he modern explanation 1s that the
double bond 1s delocalized The four p, atome orbitals from B and the
three F atoms form a four-centre x molecular orbital covering all four
atoms which contains two bonding electrons Delocalized x bonding 1s

‘The empty 2p, orbital on the boron atom in BFy can also be filed by a
lone pair of electrons from donor molecules such as Et,O, NH, (CHy)sN
fr by 1ons such as F” When this occurs, a tetrahedral molecule or 1on is
formed

‘Once a tetrahedral complex has been formed, the possibilty for x bonding
‘no longer exists. In HN ~» BF3 the B—F distance 1s 1 38A, and in MesN
= BF) the distance is 139A, much longer than the 130A in BPy Since
the boron halides wil accept electron patrs from numerous atoms and ions
such as F-, O, N, P and S, they are acting as strong Lewis acids

‘The tuhalides are emportant industrial chemucals, particularly BF, and to
lesser extent BCl; ‘They are wsed to prepare elemental boron They are
also very useful for promoting certain organic reactions In some cases BF
15 used up in the reaction, and in others it acts as a catalyst by forming
2 BF, complex with one or both reactants. Forming an “intermediate com-
pound’ in this way lowers the actwation energy Examples include
