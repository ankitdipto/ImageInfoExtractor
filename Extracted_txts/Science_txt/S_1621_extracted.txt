{ , TRIHALIDES

3, Considerable quantities of BF; are also used as a polymerization
catalyst in the production of polyisobutenes (used to:make viscostatic
- Jubricating ils), coumarone-indene resins, and butadiene~styrene
rubbers.

‘About 4000 tonnes a year of BF; are produced in the USA from BO; or
borak: /
“B,03 + 6HE + 3H,SO, > 2BF; + 3H2SO,-H,O
Naj[B,Os(OH).] + 12HF 2S [Na;O(BF;)s] 2S
4BF; + 2NaHSP, + H,0

The boron halides are all hydrolysed by water. BF; hydrolyses incom-
pletely and forms fluoborates. This is because the HF first formed reacts
with the H3BO3.

4BF; + 12H,O — 4H;BO; + 12HF
12HF + 3H5BO,— 3H* + 3[BF,]~ + 9H,O

4BF; + 3H,O — HBO; + 3H* + 3[BF,4]~
The other halides hydrolyse completely, giving boric acid.
BCI, + 3H,0 > H3BO; + 3HCI

The fluorides of Al, Ga, In and TI are toric and have high melting
points. The other halides are largely covalent when anhydrous. AICI,
AIBr; and GaCl; exist as dimers, thus attaining an octet of electrons. The
dimeric formula is‘retained when the halides dissolve in non-polar solvents
such as benzene. However, when the halides dissolve in water, the high
enthalpy of hydration is sufficient to break the covalent dimer into
{M-6H,0}>+ and 3X~ ions. At low temperatures AICI; exists as a close
packed lattice of Cl- with A+ occupying octahedral holes. On heating
AlCl species are formed and the volume of the solid greatly increases. This
pistrates how close the bonding in this compound is to the ionic/covalent

order,

Group 13 elements have only three valency electrons. When these are
used, to form three covalent bonds, the atom has a share in only six
electrons. The compounds are therefore electron deficient. The BX
halides attain an octet by x bonding. The other elements in the group have
larger atoms and cannot get effective n overlap, so they polymerize to
remedy the electron deficiency.

AIC|; is an important industrial chemical. Production is about 25000
tonnes/year in the USA alone. Anhydrous AICI; (and to a lesser extent
AIBr;) is used as the ‘catalyst’ in a variety of Friedel-Crafts type of
Teactions for alkylations and acylations. Large amounts of ethylbenzene

are made in this way and are used to make styrene. (Polystyrene produc-
tion was 8.2 million tonnes in 1991.)
