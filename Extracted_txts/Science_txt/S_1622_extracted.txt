[AICH 1s also used in the manufacture of anthraquinone (used in the
<yestuffs industry), and dodecylbenzene (used to make detergents), and in
tke isomenzation of hydrocarbons (petroleum industry)

DIHALIDES

Boron forms halides of formula BX, These decompose slowly at room
temperature B,CI, can be made as follows

2BCh + 2Hg tHE BCL + Hp

‘There is free rotation about the B—B bond and n the gaseous and liquid
slates the molecule adopts a non eclipsed conformation In the Solid state
the molecule 1s planar because of erystal forces and ease of packing
Gallum and indium also form ‘dihalides’ see diagram on page 387

‘These are more properly written Ga*[GaCl] and In7[loC) and.
