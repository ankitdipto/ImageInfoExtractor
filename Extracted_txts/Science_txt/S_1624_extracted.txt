‘THE GROUP 13 ELEMENTS

 

BORON HYDRIDES

Compounds known :
None of the Group 13 elements react directly with hydrogen but sevéral
interesting hydndes ate known ‘The boron hydudes are sometimes called
boranes by analogy with the alkanes (hydrocarbons) Almost 20 boranes
hhave been reported, and 1 are well charactenzed They fall into two
senies

1 ByHev+a (Called rudo boranes)
2. Alless stable series B,Hree (called arachno boranes)

In cases where the nomenclature 1s ambiguous, as for example for penta
borane 115 usual to anclude the number of hydrogen atoms in the name

Preparation

Diborane 1s the simplest and most studied of the hydndes, It is used 10
prepare the higher boranes, and 1s an important reagent in synthetic
‘organic chemistry For the latter purpose it1s normally generated in situ Tt
18a versatile reagent for the production of organoboranes which are useful
intermediates im organic synthess Alternatively diborane ts used as a
powerful electrophilic reducing agent for certain functional groups It
attacks sites with a high electron density such as N in cyanides and nutnites
and O in carbonyl compounds

R-C=N— RCH:NH;
R—NO;— RNH2 ve
R—CHO— RCH;OH

Diborane may be prepared by a variety of methods Boranes were first
prepared by Allred Stock, who pioneered this branch of, chemistry
