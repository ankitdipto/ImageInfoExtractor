between 1912 and 1936. He heated Mg and B to give magnesium boride
Meg,Bz, and then treated this with orthophosphoric acid. The reaction gives
a mixture of products. There were enormous difficulties with this early
work because the compounds were highly reactive, flammable, and hydro-
lysed by water. Stock developed vacuum line techniques, which were pre-
viously unknown, to handle these reactive compounds. This preparative
method has now been superseded except for making BgHio.

Many other methods have been used:

There are several convenient laboratory preparations:
1. Reducing the-etherate complexes of the boron halides with Li[AlH,].
4[Et,0 - BF3} + 3Li[AIH,] “28H, + 3Li{AIF,] + 4Et,O

2. Reacting Na[BH,] and iodine in the solvent diglyme. Diglyme is a
polyether CH;O0GH,CH,OCH,CH,OCH3.

3. Reducing BF; with Na[BH,] in diglyme.

Method (3) is particularly useful when diborane is required as a reaction
pagnediary. It is produced in situ, and used without the need to isolate or
purify it,

Diborane is a colourless gas, and must be handled with care as it is highly
Teactive. It catches fire spontaneously in air and explodes with dioxygen.
The heat of combustion is very high. In the laboratory it is handled in a
vacuum frame. Since it reacts with the grease used to lubricate taps, special
taps must be used. It is instantly hydrolysed by water, or aqueous alkali.
At red heat the boranes decompose to boron and hydrogen.

h Most syntheses of higher boranes involve heating B2H., sometimes with
'ydrogen. A complex reaction occurs when B Hg is heated in a sealed
