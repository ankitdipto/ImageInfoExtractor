tube Vanous higher boranes are formed (BeHjo BsHyy, BgHiy and
Biotls.) The ByH, molecule probably breaks into the very reactive
sntermesiate (BH) which has only a transtent existence and reacts wth
BiHe, giving another intermediate (BsHs} This loses hydrogen forming
{B3H;}, which reacts with more {BHy) to give BsHyo In a sumulér way a
vanety of higher boranes are formed depending on the exact conditions
For example
(Sh at 80-90°C, 200 atmospheres)
BaHs— Bulho

(caps at 200-250°C)
BaHe + Hp BsHy

(Glow pyrotyss in sealed tube 150°C)
ByHe — Biot

‘Most of the higher boranes are liquids, but Bey and Bigly« are solids As
the molecular weight increases, they gradually become more stable in ar,
‘and less sensitive fo water Byoftys nert m ait and can be recovered from
aqueous solutions At one time the boranes were considered a5 possible
‘gh energy rocket fuels ‘The aun was to replace hydrocarbon fuels in
sultry aircraft and missles. Over a tone of BgHys was made for this
‘purpose Interest in tins use disappeared when it was found that combus
tion to B03 was incomplete Because of this the exhaust nozzles of the
rocket became partly blocked with an mnvolatile BO polymer

REACTIONS OF THE BORANES

Hydroboration

A very important reaction occurs between BjHy (or BF; + NaBH, and
alkenes and alkynes:

3B + 3RCH=CHR ~ B(CH,—CH.R),

3B,H, + IRC=R + B(RC=CHR),

‘The reactions are carnted out in dry ether under an atmosphere of dimtro
igen because BH, and the products are very reactive ‘The alkylborane
Products BR, are not usualy isolated They may be converted as follows
4 to hydrocarbons by treatment with earboxyhc acids,
2 to alcohols by reaction with alkaline #02, oF
3. to esther ketones or carboxylic acids by oxidation with chromic acid
‘The complete process 1s called hydroboration, and results in cs
hydrogenation, or ci hydration Where the organic molecule 1s nots)
metrical, the reacton follows the anti Markovmikov rule, thats B attaches
to the feast substituted C atom
