Hydroboration is a simple and useful process for two main reasons:

1. The mild conditions required for the initial hydride addition.
2. The variety of products which can be produced using different reagents
to break the B—C bond.

H.C. Brown won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1979 for work on these
organoboron compounds.

Reaction with ammonia

All the boranes act as Lewis acids and can accept electron pairs. Thus they
react with amines, forming simple adducts. They also react with ammonia,
but the products depend on the conditions:

Boron nitride is a white slippery solid. One B atom and one N atom
together have the same number of valency electrons as two C atoms. Thus
boron nitride has almost the same structure as graphite, with sheets made
up of hexagonal rings of alternate B and N atoms joined together. The

Sheets are stacked one on t tl ivi
