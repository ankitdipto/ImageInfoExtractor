Figure 12.10 Simanty in structure between (a) boron nitride and graphite, (8)
borazine and benzene.

Borazine BsNsHy is sometimes called ‘inorgamie benzene’ because its
structure shows some formal similarity with benzene, with delocalized
electrons and aromatic character. Their physical properties are also
similar.

Borazine and substituted borazines are now made:

3BCh + 3NH.CH SBN HC, MEL Bn,

Borazine forms x complexes such as BN3Hs—Cr(CO)s with transition

‘metal compounds. Borazine is considerably more reactive than benzene,
and addition reactions occur quite readily:
