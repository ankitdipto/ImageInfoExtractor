STRUCTURES OF THE BORANES

The bonding and structures of the boranes are of great interest. They are
different from all other hydrides. There are not enough valency electrons

to form conventional two-electron bonds between all of the adjacent pairs \ yn Aaah
of atoms, and so.these compounds are termed electron deficient. (:) Bok
In diborane there are 12 valency electrons, three from each B atom and if \ H (aah,
six from the H atoms. Electron diffraction results indicate the structure
shown in Figure 12.11. Figure 12.11 The structure of

The two bridging H atoms are in a plane perpendicular to the rest of the diborane.

molecule and prevent rotation between the two B atoms. Specific heat
measurements confirm that rotation is hindered. Four of the H atoms are
ina different environment from the other two. This is confirmed by Raman
Spectra and by the fact that diborane cannot be methylated beyond
Me,B,H, without breaking the molecule into BMe3.

| : The terminal B—H distances are the same as the bond lengths measured
i non-electron-deficient compounds. These are assumed to be normal
covalent bonds, with two electrons shared between two atoms. We can
describe these bonds as two-centre two-electron bonds (2c-2e).

Thus the electron deficiency must ve associated with the bridge groups.
The Aature of the bonds in the hydrogen bridges is now well established.
Obviously they are abnormal bonds as the two bridges involve only one
clectron from each boron atom and one from each hydrogen atom, making
a total of four electrons. An sp® hybrid orbital from each boron atom
wrenaps with the ‘Is orbital- of the hydrogen. This gives a delocalized
r , ecular orbital covering all three nuclei, containing one pair of electrons
