 

1. Phosphorylation of
glucose by ATP.

 

 

2-3, Rearrangement,
followed by a second
ATP phosphorylation.

 

 

4-5. The six-carbon
molecule is split into
two three-carbon
molecules—one GSP,
another that is
converted into G3P in
another reaction.

 

 

6. Oxidation followed by
phosphorylation produces
two NADH molecules and
two molecules of BPG,
each with one high-energy
phosphate bond.

 

 

7. Removal of high-energy
phosphate by two ADP
molecules produces two
ATP molecules and leaves
two 3PG molecules.

 

 

 

 

8-9. Removal of water yields
two PEP molecules,
each with a high-energy
phosphate bond.

 

 

 

 

10. Removal of high-energy
phosphate by two ADP
molecules produces two
ATP molecules and two
pyruvate molecules.

The glycolytic pathway. The first five reactions convert a molecule of glucose into two molecules of G3P. The second five reactions

convert G3P into pyruvate.
