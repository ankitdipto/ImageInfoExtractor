3, Three-centre bridge bonds including B.. .H. . .B as in diborane. These
are 3c-2e bonds.

4, Three-centre bridge bonds including B...B...B, similar to the
hydrogen bridge in (3). These are called ‘open boron bridge bonds’. and
are of the type 3c-2e.

5, Closed 3c-2e bonds between three B atoms.

Decaborane-14 has ten B atoms. This number is two short of being able
to form a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron has 12 corners and 20 faces.
It is a closed cage structure, and is particularly stable. The two extra atoms
required to complete the cage may be added by reacting ByoHs with an
ethyne, forming a carborane (Figure 12.14).

BwHis + RC=CR > ByCoHwR2

Alternatively two B atoms may be added to complete the cage by reacting
Biol, with Me3;N > BHs.

BioHis + 2Me:N-+BH, — 2[Me,NHJ*[Bi2H ie]?

ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS

Besides the carboranes and the alkylboranes discussed earlier, all the
Group 13 trihalides will react with Grignard reagents and organolithium
reagents, forming trialkyl or triaryl compounds:
BF, + 3C,HsMgl > B(C2Hs)3
AIC], + 3CH3;Mgl > Al(CH;);
GaCh + 3C,)HsLi > Ga(C,Hs)s
InBr3x + 3CyHsLi > In(CgHs)y
The aluminium compounds are unusual because they have dimeric struc-
tures, and appear to have three-centre bonds involving sp* hybrid orbitals
on Al and c in Al—C—AI bridges (Figure 2.15).
Another important route to organoaluminium compounds is from alu-
a metal and H2. The two elements do not react directly to give
} +. However, aluminium does take up hydrogen in the presence of
aluminium alkyl catalysts (Ziegler catalysts).
Al + 3H, + 2Et,Al > 3EtAIH
Alkenes may be added to AI~H bonds.

EtAIH + HyC=CH, > EAI—CH,—CH; i.e. EtyAl
