Long chains up to Cay may be grown Hydrolysis of these fongish-
chain aluminum alkyls gives straight chain hydrocarbons called polyeth-
ylene or polythene Formed in this way these are low molecular weight
polymers (oF oligomers), and are of no commercial use I a transition
metal catalyst such as TiCl, (Natta catalyst) 1s used then polymerization
as much quicker Furthermore the reaction does not require a high pres-
sure and a much higher molecutar weight polymer 1s produced. These
high molecular weight polymers are very important as one route to com
mercial polythene (see Chapter 20 under ‘Organometallic compounds’)

‘Alcohols with chain lengths of about C,, are produced from ethene by
growing suitable aluminium alkyls, oxidizing with air and then hydro-
lysing wth water Reaction of these alcohols with SOs gives sulphonates
R—SOsH which are then neutralized to make biodegradable detergents

considerable industrial importance (Commercial polythene 1s made 1
two ways, either using titanium catalysts or by a peronde-nduced free
fadical polymenzation, rather than with alumnium alkyls )
