INTRODUCTION

Carbon s extremely widespread in nature Its an essential constituent of
all ving matter, a5 proteins, carbohydrates and fats Carbon diaside 1s
‘essential m photosynthesis, and is evolved mn respiration Organic chemistry
ts devoted to the chemistry of carbon containing compounds. Inorganic
compounds produced on a large scale include carbon black, coke, graphite,
carbonates, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide (as a fuel gas), urea, calcium
carbide, caloum eyanamide and carbon disulphide “There 1s great interest
4» organomelalie compounds, carbonyls and x bonding complexes

‘The discovery that int (hydrated Si02) had a sharp cutting edge Was
very umportant in the development of human technology Nowadays icon
1s important in a number of matentals produced 1n high tonnages These
include cement, cerames, clays, bricks, glass and the sicone polymers
‘The very pure element 1s important in the microelectronics industeres
(transistors and computer chips)

Germanium 1s hitle known, but tin and lead are very well known and
have been used as metals since before Biblical times Lead sheet was used
‘on the floor in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (one of the wonders of the
ancient world) to prevent the water escaping
