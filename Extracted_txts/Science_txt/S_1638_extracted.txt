extraction of 1ron and many other metals The distilation of coal also
provides a valuable source of orgame chemicals

In 1992, 930000 tonnes of natural graphite were mined (China 59%,
South Korea 17%, the Soviet Union 7% and India 5%) ‘Thus 1s usually
found as a mixture with mica, quartz and sileates, which contains 10
60% C Graphite 1s separated from most of the impurities by flotation
Finally sts purified by heating with HCl and HE in a vacuum to remove the
last traces of silicon compounds as SiF Sedimentary deposits of carbon
ace mined in Merico This was once thought to be amorphous carbon, but
1s now regarded as mrctocrystallne (very finely divided) graphite Nearly
as much grapinte 18 made synthetically as 1s mined

Graphite 1s used for making electrodes stcel making and metal foun-
des for crucibles asa lubricant. and in pencils, brake linings and brushes
for electne motors It 1s also used as the moderator in the cotes of gos
cooled nuclear reactors, where st slows down neutrons

‘Activated charcoal ts made by heating or chemucally oxidizing sawdust or
peat World production was 864200 tonnes in 1991 Active carbon bas an
enormous surface area, and 1s used to punfy and decolorwe sugat and
other chemicals Its also used to absorb porsonous gases in gas masks, In
filter beds at sewage plants and as a catalyst for some reacuons

‘The largest sources of diamonds are Australia 41%, Botswana 16%,
“Zane 14%, the Sovset Union 11%, and South Aftica 10% World pro-
duction of raturat diamonds was 98400000 carats or 19 68 tonnes in 1992
Large diamonds are cut as gemstones, and thetr size 1S measured in carats
(Ug = S.carats) About 30% are sed as gemstones, and 70% are used for
industrial purposes. mainly for making dnills ot as an abrasive powder for
cutting and polishing. as diamond 1s very hatd (10 on Mohs’ scale) ~ see
Appendix Nits economic to make small industrial quality diamonds
synthetically, by high temperature and pressure treatment of graphite
