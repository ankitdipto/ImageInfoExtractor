hard Fe ts removed by blowing aur through the molten mixture to oxidize
the 1ron 10 FeO, which then floats to the surface

‘The main uses of Sn are electroplating steel to make tinplate, and
making alloys Tin-plate is extenswely used for making eans for food and
drinks The most important alloy 15 solder (Sn/Pb), but there are many
others, including bronze (Cu/Sn) gun metal (Cu/Sh/Pb/Zn) and pewter
(Sn/Sb/Cu) SnOz 15 used a8 a glaze in ceramics, and ss often mixed with
‘other metal oxides as pigments for pottery SnCi, and Me;SnCl are used
to produce very thin films of SO; on glass This toughens the glass, so
Dottles can be made with thinner walls and glass can be made seratch
resistant (useful for spectacles) Slightly thicker films are put on glass
windows, to reduce heat losses The film allows visible light to pass
through, but reflects IR radianon, and thus keeps heat mside a room
A film of SnO, 1s put onto anrcrait windows This conducts electricity and
thus produces heat, and prevents the window from frosting up Large
amounts of organotin compounds are used (estimated to be over 400K
tonnes/year) Compounds R:SaX. (where R xs an alkyl group such as
evoctyl and X i an organic acid residue such as laurate) ate used to
stabitze halogenated plastics such as PVC. Without a stabilizer, the plastic
grades in sunlight. air of on heating and becomes britle and dis
coloured The butyl compound BuySnXs 1s used to ‘cure’ oF vuleanize
silicone rubber at room temperature. Inorganic in compounds are used as
fame retardants and smoke suppressants. Trtorgano compounds such as
BusSnOH or PhySnOAc are extensively used in agriculture to contol fungt
such as potato blight (Borryus infestans) and simular fungal attack of vines,
tice and sugar beet Similar compounds kil red spider mites which attack
fruit crops such as apples and pears, and other insects and larvae. ‘They are
also used to preserve wood They make very effecuve and long lasting
antfouling paint for boats, preventing the build-up of barnacles This use
has now been banned because the heavy metal Sn seems to have entered
the food chain
