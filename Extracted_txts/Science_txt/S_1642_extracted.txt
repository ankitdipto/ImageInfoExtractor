Diamonds ae typically coloures, though mdusial diamonds ac often

“blue diamonds conta a trace of Alnsead In diamond each C stom 1s

ddvections Thus the meltmg point abnormally high (about 3930°C) and
the structure is very hatd (see Figure 13 1) (Ina rate modification of
diamond, the tetrahedra are arranged differently to give a wurtzite like
Structure and a exagonal unit cell)

Graphue 1s composed of flat two-dimensional sheets of carbon atoms
Each sheet 1s hexagonal net of C atoms, and may be regarded asa fused

for the remarkable sofiness of the crystals (>1 on Mohs' scale) (See
Appendix N for Mohs’ scale ) Graphite 1s used as a lubricant, either on
Us own or n graphited oul In contrast diamond shard (10 on Mohs’ scale)
and has abraswe properties The wide spacing of sheets in graphite also
means that the atoms do not pack together to fill space very effectwely
