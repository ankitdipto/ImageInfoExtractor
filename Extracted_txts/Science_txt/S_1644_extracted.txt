In addition carbon differs from the other elements in sts unique abihty
to form pr-px multiple bonds such as C=C C=C C=O C=§ and
CEN The later elements do not form pr—pr bonds principally because
‘the atomae orbiils are too large and diffuse to obtam effecnve overlap but
they can use orbitals in multiple bonding, parucularly between Stand N
‘or O Thus N(SiHfy)s 1s planar and has px-dx bonding but N(CH3); 15
pyramidal and has no x bonding (sce Figure 13 18)

Carbon also differs from the others in sts marked abulity to form chains
{catenatyon) ‘This 1s because the C—C bonds are very strong and the
bonds S1—Si_Ge—Ge and Sn—Sn decrease progressively sn strength
(Table 13.4)

Bond Bond energy Remarks
(mol)
ce 3a Forms many chains of great fength
SiS 2 Forma few chains upto SuFlyqin hydrides
and SinF, SixCh Stein With halogens
260 Forms a few chains up to Gey m hydndes
and Ge;Cl, with CL
240 Forms dimer Sn Hin hydrides

   

 

Carbon and silicon have only s and p electrons. but the other elements
follow 2 completed transition series with ten d electrons Thus some
ifferences are expected and carbon and silicon differ both from one
another and from the rest of the group while germanium tun and fead
form a graded series

CARBON DATING

“The techmque of carbon dating can be used to messure the age of
archeological objects Carbon occurs largely as the wsotope 7C but theres
a small amount of "'C which leads to the average atomuc weight of 12 O11

In the atmosphere, ditrogen 1s bombarded by cosme neutrons, which
produces the sotope #C
