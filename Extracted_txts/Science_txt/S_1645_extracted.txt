[ PHYSICAL, PROPERTIES

This carbon reacts with dioxygen, forming CO2, which is eventually used by
green plants in photosynthesis to make glucose sugar. The glucose may be
used by the plant to build starch, proteins, cellulose and other materials in
the plant. All plant tissues thus contain traces of '‘C. Animals eat plants,
so they too contain traces of ‘$C. This isotope of carbon is weakly
radioactive. It undergoes B-decay, and has a half life of 5668 years. While
the plant or animal is alive, a natural balance exists between the intake of
radiocarbon and that lost by decay. This steady state gives 15.3 + 0.1
disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. When the plant or animal
dies the intake of radiocarbon ceases, but B-decay continues. Thus a very
old sample of wood, cloth, paper, leather etc. will be less radioactive than
a,recent sample. A very small sample is burnt in dioxygen, and the CO,
produced is introduced into a suitable radiation counter. By carefully
measuring the present radioactive decay rate, it is possible to calculate how
long ago the plant or.animal died. This provides an absolute scale for
dating objects of plant or animal origin between 1000 and 10000 years old.
The technique has recently been used to determine the age of the Turin
shroud, and many other objects. W.F. Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Chemistry in 1960 for developing this technique.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

Covalent radii

The covalent radii increase down the group. The difference in size between
Si and Ge is less than might be otherwise expected because Ge has a full 3d
shell which shields the nuclear charge rather ineffectively. In a similar way

the small difference in size between Sn and Pb is because of the filling of
the 4f shell. ‘
