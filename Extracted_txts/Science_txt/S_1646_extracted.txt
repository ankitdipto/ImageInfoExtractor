‘THE GROUP 14 ELEMENTS:

 

 

 

 

of energy required to form M‘* rons i extremely large and hence simple
rome compounds are rare The only elements which will give a large
enough electronegatwnty difference to gwe sone character are F and O
‘The compounds Sn, POF, Sn, POF, SiOz, and PbO» are signcantly
tonic, but the only significant metal ron is Pb**

 

‘Melung points

(Chas an extremely high melting pomnt Si melts appreciably fower than C,
bout the values for St and Ge are sull high They all have the very stale
diamond type of lattice Melting tavolves breaking the strong covalent
bbonds in thas lattice, and so requires a lot of energy ‘The melting points
decrease on descending the group because the M~M bonds become
weaker as the atoms increase in size (Table 13 4) Sn and Pb are metalic,
and have much lower melting points ‘They do not use all four outer
electrons for metatle bonding

‘Metallic and non-metallic character

The change from non metal to metal with mereasing atomuc number 1 well
allustrated in Group 14, where C and St are non metals, Ge bas some
metallic properties, and Sn and Pb are metals. The yncrease in metalic
character shows itself m the structures and appearance of the elements,
physical properties such as malleabiity and electrical conductivity, and in
chemical properties stich as the increased tendency 10 form M** rons and
the acidic or baste properties of the oxides and hydroxides

Four covalent compounds

‘The mayonty of the compounds are four covalent In this case all four
outer electrons take part im bonding In the valence bond theory this 15
explained by promoting electrons from the ground state to an excited state
‘The energy needed to unpanr and promote the electron is more than repaid
by the energy released on forming two extra covatent bonds The distribu
thon of the four orbitals results m a tetrahedral structure, consistent with
sp" hybridization
