GRAPHITE COMPOUNDS

‘The distance between layers an graphite 1s large hence the bonding
between layers is weak ‘Thus a large number of substances can invade the
space between sheets forming intercalation compounds of varying com
position When atoms, molecoles or 1ons mnvade the space between the
layers, they cause an merease inthe interlayer distance Provided thatthe
graphite sheets remain fat, the new compound retains sts graphite hike
character the x electrons continue to be delocalized over the whole layet
and are thus able to conduct electricity Ifthe invading atoms add electrons
to the x system, the electncal conductvty ts mnereased Reactions of ths
fond (1 intercalation reactions) are often reversible

‘When graphite 1s heated to about 300°C with the vapours ofthe heavier
‘Group 1 metals K, Rb and Cs, st absorbs metal, forming a bronze coloured
compound CyM The bronze colour 1s due to the formation of metal stom
clusters at these relatively high metal concentrations, in the same way #8
<dlusters are formed m solutions of these metals m liquid ammonia. If CM
1s heated to 350°C under reduced pressure, metal 1s lost and a series of
Intercalation compounds are formed ranging from steel blue to blue oF
black sa colour, depending on the number of fayers invaded by the metal

sntact, but the gap between the sheets increases because ofthe presence of
metal atoms ‘The C atoms in one sheet are arranged vertically above those
