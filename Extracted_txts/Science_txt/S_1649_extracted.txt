in the sheet below, rather than in the ABAB. .. arrangement found in
a-graphite. Since the sheets remain flat, they retain their delocalized
electron system. Thus CgK can conduct electricity, but the electrical
resistance is appreciably lower than for a-graphite, i.e. CsM conducts
better than graphite (resistance at 285K: o-graphite 28.4ohmcm; CgK
4.02ohmcm). Graphite is diamagnetic, and CyK is paramagnetic. This
suggests that bonding between metal and graphite layers involves the
transfer of an electron from the alkali metal atom to the 7 system (that is to
the conduction band) of the graphite sheets (K > K* + e). The presence
of the invading species forces the graphite sheets apart from their usual
distance of 3.35A up to a distance as great as 10A. These alkali metal
graphite compounds are highly reactive. They may explode in water, and
react vigorously in air.

FeCl, reacts with graphite and forms a different type of intercalation
compound. Similar behaviour is found with.
