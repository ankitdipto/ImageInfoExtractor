‘THE GROUP 14 ELEMENTS:

 

 

3a large number of halides including CaCl, CuBr, FeCls, AICI, CIF,
Tis, MoCls, SbFs. UCI, and XeFy,

4. a number of oxides CrO3, MoOs. SO} NOs and C1,Or,

5 and some sulphides FeS>, PaS, V2S3

Some of the invading compounds can ct as electron parr acceptors In
others, for exaraple FeCl the compound CaFeCly 1s formed in which the
FeCh forms a layer lattice within the host lattice of graphite This 1s almost
the same as the layer lattice formed by FeChy itself The presence of this
{and of invading species increases the elecineal conductwnty of graphite by
2 factor of up to ten times There seems to be a transfer of electrons from
grape othe mvading atoms, Wh Cand Br te halogen may semore
bonding electrons from graphite (Cl + ¢—+ C1") thus leaving a ‘positive
hole" sn the valence band The postive hole can migrate, and therefore
can carry current It 1s not knqvin how conduction occurs in the fale
ntercalation compounds

A third class of compounds 1s formed between O and F with graphite
‘These compounds are non conducting Graphite oxide 1 formed when
sraphute ts oxidized with strong reagents such as concentrated HNO,
HCIO, or KMnO, Graphite oxide 1s unstable, pale lemon coloured and
rnonstorchiometric It decomposes slowly at 70°C, and catches fire at
200°C, forming H;0. CO;, CO and C The O C ratio approaches 1 2,
but soften short of oxygen and frequently contamns hydrogen ‘The inter-
layer spacing ts creased to 6-7 The oxide absorbs water alcohols,
acetone and a vanety of molecules This may increase the interlayer
spacing upto 19A_X ray diffraction shows a layer structure with puckered
sheets made up of a hexagonal network of atoms The C, units are mostly
1m the chair conformation, but a few C=C bonds remain ‘The oxygen
forms bridging (ether-lke) inkages C—O—C and C—OH groups which
may undergo keto-enol tautomerism ==C—OH to )C=O The sheets ate
buckled because all four electrons on a C atom are now molved mo
‘bonding This destroys the delocalized system of mobile x electrons found
4h the flat sheets an graphite, and this explains the loss of electncal
conductivity

Graphite fluoride 1s formed by heating srophite im Fz at 450°C The
reaction proceeds at a lower temperature in the presence of HF This can
happen n cells producing Fz and not only will it destroy the electrode, but
At may also cause an explosion The product CF, 1s nonstoichiometnc, and
1 varies from 07 to 098 The colour vanes from black through grey 10
ssler and white wath inereasing fuorine content The interlayer spacing
about 8A. The structure 1s thought to be @ layer structure with buckled
sheets It involves tetrahedral bonding by C atoms CF is non conducting,
and very unreactive

 

CARBIDES

Compounds of carbon and a less clectronegatne element are called
‘carbides This excludes compounds with N. P. O, § and the halogens from
his section Carbides are of three main types
