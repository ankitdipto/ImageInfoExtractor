 

CARBIDES

1. ionic or salt-like
2, interstitial or metallic
3. covalent

The formulae of some of the compounds cannot be rationalized by the
application of simple valency rules. All three types are prepared by heating
the metal or its oxide with carbon or a hydrocarbon at temperatures of
2000°C.

Salt-like carbides

It is convenient to group these’ depending on whether the structure
contains C, C2 or C3 ‘anions .

Beryllium carbide Be2C is a red solid and may be made by heating C and
BéO at 2000°C. Aluminium carbide Al,C; is a pale yellow solid formed by
heating the elements in an electric furnace. BeC contains individual C
atoms/ions, but the structure of Al,C; is complex. It is misleading to
formulate the structure as 4A1°* and 3C*~ as such a high charge separation
is unlikely. Both BezC and Al,C; are called methanides because they react
with HO, yielding methane.

Carbides with a C, unit are well known. They are formed mainly by the
elements in Group 1 (M3C,); Group 2 (M"C,); the coinage metals (Cu,
Ag, Au); Zn and Cd; and some of the lanthanides (LnC2 and Ln4(C2)3).
These are all colourless ionic compounds and contain the carbide ion

~(—C=C—). By far the most important compound is CaC. This is made
commercially by strongly heating lime and coke:

CaO + 3C > CaC, + CO AH = $466k mol”!

The reaction is endothermic, and a temperature of 2200°C is required.
These carbides react exothermically with water, liberating ethyne (formerly
called acetylene), so they are called acetylides.

CaC, + 2H,O > Ca(OH), + HC=CH

Production of CaC; reached a maximum of 7 million tonnes/year in 1960,
but has since declined to 4.9 million tonnes in 1991. At one time it
was the major source of acetylene for oxy-acetylene welding, but ethyne is
now obtained mainly from oil. CaC is an important chemical intermediate
and is used on an industrial scale to produce calcium cyanamide. Cyana-
mide is used as a nitrogenous fertilizer, and to make urea and melamine.
(See Chapter 11, under ‘Carbides’.)
CaC) + No “5sca(NCN) + C

The acetylides have a-NaCl type of lattice, with Ca?* replacing Na* and
G Teplacing Cl. In CaC,, SrCz and BaC, the elongated shape of the
(C=C)*" ion causes tetragonal distortion of the unit cell, that is it
Clongates the unit cell in one direction — see Chapter 3 Figure 3.12.

One of the two carbides of magnesium Mg,C; contains a C; unit, and on
hydrolysis with water it yields propyne CH;—C==CH. .
