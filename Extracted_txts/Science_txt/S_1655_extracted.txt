Carbonyl compounds may be made by a variety of reactions:

Ni + 4CO=>Ni(CO),

200°C under pressure
eee

Fe + SCO Fe(CO)s

photolvsrs

2Fe(CO)s Fex(CO)y + CO

CrCl + 3Fe(CO)s 25. Cr(CO), + 3FeCl> + 9CO

In the Mond process (now obsolete) for purifying nickel, nickel carbonyl
Ni(CO); was made from Ni and CO at 50°C. (Water gas was used as the
source of CO.) Ni(CO), is a gas and can be separated from other metals
and impurities. The Ni(CO), gas was then decomposed at 230°C. Though
the original process is obsolete, a modified process is used in Canada.

The bonding in CO may be represented as three electron pairs shared
between the two atoms:

:C:0: or C=O

It is better represented using the molecular orbital theory (see Chapter 4).

The carbon-metal bond in carbonyls may be represented as the donation
of an electron pair from carbon to the metal M <— C==O. This original
o bond is weak. A stronger second bond is formed by back bonding,
sometimes called dative x bonding. This arises from sideways overlap of a
full d,, orbital on the metal with the empty antibonding x*2p, orbital of
the carbon, thus forming a n M > C bond. The total bonding is thus
M==C=O. The filling, or partial filling, of the antibonding orbital on C
reduces the bond order of the C—O bond from the triple bond in CO
towards a double bond. This is shown by the increase in C—O bond length
from 1.128 Ain CO to about 1.15A in many carbonyls.

h co is the Most studied organometallic ligand. Because of the back
mine it Is sometimes called a x acceptor ligand. The drift of x electron
cnn from M to C makes the ligand more negative, which in turn
Paslaad itso donating power. Thus CO forms weak bonds to Lewis acids
ea acceptors) such as BF; as only o bonding is involved. In
