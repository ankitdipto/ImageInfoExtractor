COs. very versatile ligand It may act as a bridging group between the
two metal atoms, for example in de tron ennea carbonyl Fex(COy CO
may stabilize metal clusters by the C forming a mult: centre bond wath
‘three metal atoms, and the x* orbitals in CO may be involved in bonding
to other meta} atoms

Carbon monoxide 1s quite reactive, and combines readily with O, Sand
the halogens F, C1 and Br
