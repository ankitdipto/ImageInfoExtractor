Carbonyl chloride is extremely toxic, and was used as a poisonous gas in:
World War I. Nowadays it is produced in quite large quantities to make
tolylene diisocyanate which is an intermediate in the manufacture of
polyurethane plastics.

Carbon dioxide CO2

CO, is a colourless, odourless gas.. It is a major industrial chemical, with
5,3 million tonnes produced in the USA and 10 million tonnes worldwide
in 1993. The main industrial source is as a by-product from the manufac-
ture of hydrogen for making ammonia.

CO + H,0 = CO, + Hz
CH, + 2H20 — CO, + 4H2
It is also recovered from fermentation processes in breweries, from the
gases evolved from calcining limestone in lime kilns and from the flue gases

from coal-burning electric power stations. The CO is recovered by ab-
sorbing it in either aqueous NaxCOs; or ethanolamine.

Itis obtained in small amounts by the action of dilute acids on carbonates.
It can also be made by burning carbon in excess of air.
