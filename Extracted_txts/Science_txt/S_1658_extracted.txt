directly to the vapour state (without gomg through the liquid state) at
~78°C under atmospheric pressure Over half the CO, produced 1s used a,
refrigerant Solid CO; s called dry ce’ or ‘cardice’, and 1s used to freeze
meat frozen foods and icecream, and in the laboratory as.a coolant Over

‘Other uses include the manufacture of urea, as an inert atmosphere, and
for neutralzing alkahs Over 35 milhon tonnes of urea were produced
worldwide in 1991 (Urea 1s the most widely used nitrogenous fertilizer
and 1s also for making formaldehyde urea resins )
