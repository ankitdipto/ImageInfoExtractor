a bidentate ligand with one C atom and one O atom bonded to the metal,
and the CO, molecule is bent.

The structure of CO; is linear O—C—O. Both C—O bonds are the
same length. In addition to o bonds between C and O. there is a three-
centre four-electron x bond covering all three atoms. This adds two 1
bonds to the structure in addition to the two o bonds. Thus the C—O bond
order is two. This is described in more detail in Chapter 4.

Biologically, carbon dioxide is important in the processes of photosyn-
thesis. where the green parts of plants manufacture glucose sugar. Ulti-
mately all animal and plant life depends on this process.

glucose

The reverse reaction occurs during the process of respiration, where
animals and plants release energy. .

C6H1204 + 602 > 6CO + 6H2O + energy
Carbon suboxides

Carbon suboxide C3O is a foul-smelling gas, boiling point 6°C. It is made
by dehydrating malonic acid with P4O,o.

HOOC- CH,- COOH “2", O=C=C=C=0 + 2H,0
matone acid 180°C

Itis stable at ~78°C and the molecule is linear. At room temperature the
gas polymerizes to a yellow solid, and at higher temperatures to red and

purple solids. The oxide reacts with H2O, giving malonic acid, and with
HCl and NH; as follows:

C0) + 2HCI—> CH,(COCI), (acid chloride)
C;02 + 2NH3 — CH(CONH))2 (amide)

rere are disputed reports that C;O. is formed by thermolysis of C30).
e only other stable suboxide is C)2Oo. This is a white solid, and is the
anhydride of mellitic acid C.(COOH)..

CARBONATES

bai are two series of salts from carbonic acid H>COs, namely carbonates
ion ton’ hydrogencarbonates HCO. The CO3~ ion is flat. The COf~
tes re exist, even though SiOZ~ does. This is probably because C is

mall, and the situation is analogous to the formation of NO; and
