Some carbonates are produced in very large amounts 315 milion
tonnesiyear of Na,CO3, 900000 tonnes/year NaHCOs, and 50000 tonnes!
year of LC, (see Chapters 9 and 10)

‘Carbonate 10ns are colourless and hence the carbonates of Group J and
2 metals are white Though Ag* salts are typically white, Ag:COs 15
yellow due to the strong polarizing effect of Ag” (NH,);CO, and Group
1 carbonates are readily soluble in water, except LiyCOs which 1 only
slightly soluble 1,COs 1 moderately soluble, but the other Group 13
carbonates are sparingly soluble or insoluble Carbonates all react wih
acids, berating COz

NaxCOs + 2HCI = 2NaCl + CO, + 1,0
Group 1 carbonates are stable to heat, and melt without decomposing
Group 2 carbonates all decompose sf heated sufficiently strongly. The
stabiluy increases as the size of the metal ron increases Most other
carbonates decompose easily

‘The only solid bicarbonates known are those of the Group 1 metals and
of NH. These are colourless solids, and aze somewhat ess soluble hat
