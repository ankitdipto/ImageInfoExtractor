from burning fossil fuels, and most of the remainder has been absorbed by
the oceans A United Nations report suggests that xf nothing xs done the

could have dramatic effects on the climate Some fertile areas like the grain
belt in the USA would become desert and erops would not grow The
increased temperature would cause more evaporation of water and hence
more rain, flooding and tropical storms n certain pats ofthe world Part
fof the polar ice caps would melt, and this together with the thermal
‘expansion of the sea would flood vast areas of land

amounts of COs dissolve in the sea this should make the pH of the
sea decrease In the extreme this merease an acidity might dissolve the
calcareous shells of molluses and other sealife thus destroying them This
