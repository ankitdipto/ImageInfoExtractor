it is very flammable. it has a very low flash point (30°C) and it ignites
spontaneously at 100°C. It is very poisonous, affecting the brain and
central nervous system. Pure samples smell like ether, but organic im-
purities frequently give it an extremely foul smell. It is a commercially
important chemical, and world production was 280400 tonnes in 1991. At
one time it was produced by heating charcoal and S vapour at about 850°C.
Nowadays it is produced mainly from a gas phase reaction between natural
gas and sulphur, catalysed by Al,O; or silica gel.

CH, + 4S——> CS, + 2H2S

The main uses of CS; are as follows:

1. The manufacture of viscose rayon (artificial silk) and cellophane. CS,
reacts with cellulose and NaOH to form sodium cellulose dithio-
carbonate (cellulose xanthate).

cellulose—O

CS, + cellulose—OH + NaOH > c=s

/
NaS

sodium cellulose xanthate

This is dissolved in lye (aqueous alkali) to give a viscous solution called
‘viscose’. On acidification, ‘viscose’ is converted back to cellulose in the
form of fibres (either rayon or cellulose wool), or as a thin film
(cellophane).

2. The manufacture of CCl, (see later under ‘Halides’).

3. Smaller amounts are used as a solvent for S in the cold vulcanization of
rubber.

CS, reacts with aqueous NaOH, giving a mixture of sodium carbonate
and sodium trithiocarbonate:

3CS, + 6NaOH — Na,CO; + 2Na,CS; + 3H,0
CS reacts with NH, giving ammonium dithiocarbamate:
CS, + 2NH3 —> NH,[H2NCS,]

CS, is a linear molecule ‘ith a similar structure to CO». CS2 forms
complexes more readily than CO2. The complex [Pt(CS,)(PPh;)] is struc-
‘urally similar to [Co(CO.)(°Ph3y]. The CS, cts as a bide tate “gand
with one C atom and one S$ atom bonded to the metal, and the CS)
molecule is bent. The S atoms may bond to other metal atoms, giving more
complicated complexes. The bonding cannot be explained by classical
localized bonds. .

Sunlight changes CS, to CS, which is why CS, is stored in dark coloured

a A high frequency electric charge also converts CS, vapour to CS.
