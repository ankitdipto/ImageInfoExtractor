OXIDES OF GERMANIUM, TIN AND LEAD

‘The dioxides GeO,, $102 and PbO; normally adopt a TiO; structure with
6 3coordination The bast ofthe oxides wcreases down the group ths
1s the usual trend Thus COp and SiO, are purely acidic GeOz 1s not as
strongly acidic as $10, and SnO; and PbO2 are amphotenc GeO;, $n0,
‘and PbO; dissolve in alkal to form germanates, stannates and plumbates
respectively The germanates have complicated structures sirmlar to the
silicates but the stannates and plumbates contain [Sn(OH)«P" and
(Po(OH)«|?~ complex 10ns There 1s no evidence of the enstence of
Ge(OH), Sa(OH), and PO(OH), and these are better represented as
[MO;(H:0),, where 11s about two. All three oxides are msoluble n acds
‘except when a complexing agent such as F~ or CI” 15 present, when
complex tons such as (GeF and [SnCl?~ are formed

‘The lower oxides GeO, SnO and PbO have layer lattices rather than the
typreal rome structures. They are slightly mote basic and tone than the
corresponding higher oxides GeO s distinctly acidic, whilst SaO and PbO
are amphoteric and dissolve in both acids and bases ‘The mncreased stability
‘of the lower valence states on descending a group is illustrated by the fact
that Gel” and Sn" are quite strong reducing agents whereas Pb! 1s stable

PbO is commercially important texistsas2 ed form called htharge and
a yellow form called massicot Litharge 1s used tn large amounts to make
Jead glass, and in ceramic glazes World production 1s about 250000
tonnes/year Black oxide’ of lead 1s a muxture of PbO and Pb, and ss
extensively used to make the plates m electr storage batteries for motor
cars The anode 1s oxidized to PLO; and the cathode 1s reduced to spongy
lead About 700000 tonnes/year are used worldwide

‘Lead also forms a mixed oxide PbO, This s called red ead and may be
represented as 2P6O POO; clearly it contains Pb(II) and PB(IV) PDO,
1s used in paint to prevent the rusting of won and steel It 1s also used
to colour and vwuleanize plastic and artifical rubber Smaller amounts
ate used in ceramics and glassmaking World production 1s about 18000
tonnes/year

Oats used as a strong oxidizing agent, and ts produced sa situ in lead
storage batteries

SILICATES
‘Occurrencesn the earth's crust

‘About 95% of the easth’s crust 1s composed of silicate minerals, alumuno
silicate clays or stlea These make up the bulk of all racks sands and
their breakdown products clays and soil Many building materials are
silicates granite, slates bricks, and cement Ceramics and glass are also
siheates
