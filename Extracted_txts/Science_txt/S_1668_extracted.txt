Principles of silicate structures

‘The mayoraty of state minerals are very insoluble, because they have an
infinite 1onie structure and because of the great strength of the SiO
bond This made it difficult to study thete structures. and physical proper
tues such as cleavage and the hardness of rocks were onginally studied The
structural principles n silicate structures have only become apparent since
the structures have been solved by X ray crystallographic methods

 

1 The electronegatuity difference between O and $1, 3.5 ~ 18 = 17
suggests that the bonds are almost 50% 1onie and 50% covalent

2 The structure may therefore he considered theoretically by both onic
and covalent. methods The radius ratio Sif? O's 029 which
suggests that Si 1s four coordinate and 1s surrounded by four O atoms at
the comers ofa tetrahedron Thus can also be predicted from the use of
the 3s and theee 3p orbitals by St for bonding. Thus silicates are based
oon ($i0,)* tetrahedral units

3. The $10, tetrahedra may exsst as discrete units, or may polymerize into
larger units by sharing comers that 1s by sharing O atoms

4 The O atoms are often close packed ot nearly close packed Close
packed structures have tetrahedral and octahedral holes and metal1ons
‘may occupy either octahedal or tetrahedral sites depending on their
size_ Most metal ions are the nght siz to fit one type of hole though
‘AN"* can fit nto either Thus Alcan replace either a metal in one of the
hotes, ora silicon atom in the iattice This is particulaely important in
the aluminosilicates

  

Occasionally Lt may occupy sites with a coordination number of 6 rather
than the usual 4, and K and Ca may have acoordinauon number of8rathet
than the usual 6 The radius rato principe a useful guide, but its only
strictly applicable fo ion compounds and silicates are partly covalent 19
these compounds the full charge separation to give Si** and O*~ does not
occur, and empincal effective omic radu’ may be used instead of normal
tome radu (see Further Reading, RD Shannon )
