 

CLASSIFICATION OF SILICATES

Orthosilicates (neso-silicates)

A wide variety of minerals contain discrete (SiO,)*~ tetrahedra, that is
they share no corners (see Figure 13.7). They have the formula M}'[SiO,],
where M may be Be, Mg, Fe, Mn or Zn, or M!*[SiO,], for example
ZrSiO4. Different structures are formed depending on the coordination
number adopted by the metal.

In willemite Zn2[SiO,], and phenacite Be2[SiO,], the Zn and Be atoms
have a coordination number of 4, and occupy tetrahedral holes.

In forsterite Mg2[SiO.], the Mg has a coordination number of 6 and

occupies octahedral holes.When octahedral sites are occupied, it is quite
common to get isomorphous replacement of one divalent metal ion by
another of similar size, without changing the structure. The mineral olivine
(Mg. Fe)2[SiO,] has the same structure as forsterite, but about one tenth of
the Mg’* ions in forsterite are replaced by Fe?* ions. The ions have the
same charge and similar radii (Mg?* 0.72 A, Fe?* 0.78 A), and occupy the
same type of hole. Thus substitution of one metal for another does not
change the structure. This mineral may also have Mn" in’some octahedral
Sites, thus giving (Mg, Fe, Mn)[SiO,]. These structures are all related to
hexagonal close-packing.
