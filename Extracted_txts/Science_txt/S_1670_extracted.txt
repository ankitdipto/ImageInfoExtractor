“The gamets are another important group of minerals with discrete tetra

‘gemstone Much larger amounts (106099 tonnes in 1993) are used to make
‘sandpaper’ The formula ts Mi'M!"[(Si0,)3] M" may be Mg, Ca or Fel,

Pyrosihcates (soro-nlicates, dsiicates)

Two tetrahedral units are jouned by sharing the O at one commer. thus
giving the unit (S1,0,)"" This 1s the simplest of the condensed silicate
tons The name pyro comes from the strnlanty in structure with pyro
phosphates such as NasP;O>, and these were named because they can be
‘made by heating orthophosphates (see Figure 13 8)

Pyrosilicates are rare One example isthortsestite Sc:{S120;] A number
of fanthanide disiicates have sumilar formulae Lna{Si,07) These are not
quite the same, as the Si—O—S1 angle not 180° as n the Se compound,
but vanes down to 133°, and the coordination number of the metal changes
from 6 to 7 and then to 8 as the sze of the metal mereases Hentamorphite
Zny(OH),{S1O5]_ HO 1s avather example, but structural studies show 00
diflerence i the lengths of the bridging and terminal Si—O bonds Thus

tation as a disiteate ton may be misleading and the structure
r consideted as (S10x] and [2n0,(OH)}| tetrahedra Inked to
sive a three-dimensional network

Cycle sitcates

If two oxygen atoms per tetrahedron are shared. ring structures may be
formed of general forrmula (SiOs)3'~ (Figure 139) Rings containing
three, four, soc and enght tetrahedral units are known, but those with three
