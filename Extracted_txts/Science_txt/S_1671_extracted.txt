Be,Alz[Si,Oix]. In beryl the Si,O,, units are aligned one above the other,
leaving channels. Na*, Li* and Cs* are commonly found in these
channels, and because of the channels the mineral is permeable to gases
consisting of small atoms or molecules, e.g. helium. Beryl and emerald are
both gemstones. Beryl is found with granite and usually forms pale green
crystals which are six-sided prisms. Emerald has the same formula as beryl
except that it contains 1-2% Cr which gives it a strong green colour.

Chain silicates

Simple chain silicates or pyroxenes are formed by the sharing of the O
atoms on two corners of each tetrahedron with other tetrahedra. This gives
the formula (SiO3)?"" (see Figures 13.10 and 13.11). A large number of
important minerals form chains, but there are a variety of different struc-
tures formed because the arrangement of the tetrahedra in space may vary
and thus affect the repeat distance along the chain. The most common
arrangement repeats after every second tetrahedron, for example in spodu-
mene LiAI[(SiO;)2] (which is the main source of Li), enstatite Mg2[(SiOs)2],
and diopsite CaMg[(SiO;)]. Wollastonite Ca;{(SiO3);] has a repeat unit of
ines tetrahedra and others are known with repeat units of 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Double chains can be formed when two simple chains are joined
together by shared oxygens. These minerals are called amphiboles, and
they are well known. There are several ways of forming double chains,

giving formulae (SixOs)?"", (Si er-, (Si 1o-
