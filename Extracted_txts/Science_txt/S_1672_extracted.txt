The most numerous and best known amphiboles are the asbestos
minerals. These are based on the structural unt (SiyOn)""~. In the
Structure (Figure 13.12) some tetrahedra share two corners, whilst otbers
share three corners. Exam, les include tremolite, CazMgq{(Siv01):](OH)s
and crocidolite Na,Fel'Fey"{(Si,0,1):(OH)., Amphiboles always contain
hydroxyl groups, which are attached to the metal fons

‘The Si-O bonds in the chains are strong and directional, Adjacent
chains are held together by the ‘etal fons present. Thus pyronenes a
azzphles cleave ready parallel tothe chains, forming {btes, For ths
seuson they are called fibrous minerals. The cleavage angle for pyroxenes®s
89, and for amphiboles 56° ‘is used as a means of identifying the
‘minerals. These angles are related to the size of the cross-sectional ta"
