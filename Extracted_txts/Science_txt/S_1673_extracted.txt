Asbestos is of considerable commercial importance, and 2.8 million
tonnes were mined in 1993 (Soviet Union 36%, Canada 19%, Kazakhstan
14%, and China and Brazil 9% each). It is useful because it is strong,
cheap, resistant to heat and flames, and also resistant to acids and alkalis.
Most is used to make asbestos reinforced cement and roofing sheets.
Smaller amounts are used for brake linings, clutch linings, asbestos paper,
adding to vinyl floor coverings, and thermal insulation for pipes, and
fibres may be woven into asbestos cloth to make fire fighting suits.

Asbestos minerals come from two different groups of silicates:

1. The amphiboles. ’
2. The sheet silicates.

The amphiboles include crocidolite Na2Fe}!Fes![SigQ22](OH)2. which is
called blue asbestos, and others derived from it by isomorphous replace-
