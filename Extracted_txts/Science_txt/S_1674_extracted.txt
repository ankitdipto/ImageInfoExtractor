ment, for example amosite or brown asbestos (Mg, Fe""):|Si0z:](OH):
‘Together these make up about 5% of the asbestos used

‘The mineral chrysotile Mgy(OH),{St20s) w& called white asbestos, and
thus 1s derwed from serpentine, and isa sheet scate This constitutes 95%
of the asbestos used

‘Though asbestosis chemically inert, it presents a serious health hazard
Inhaling asbestos dust causes asbestosis or scarning of the fungs It also
causes lung cancer Blue asbestos appears to be the worst hazard The
disease may have a latent period of 20-30 years. The best control 1s t0
minimize asbestos dust, and to handle asbestos wet if possible

Sheet siheates (phyflo sitcates)

When SiO, units share three corners the structure formed 1s an mfite
two dimensional sheet of empirical formula (Si,04)2"” (see Figure 13 35)
“There are strong bonds within the Si~O shee, ut much weaker forces
‘hold each sheet to the next one Thus these minerals tend to cleave unto
thin sheets

Structures with sumple planar sheets are rate A large number of sheet
silicates are umportant and well known These have slightly mote
‘comphcated structures, and are made up of either two or three ayers
youmed together These include

1. Clay minerals (kaohimte, pyrophylhite, tal)

2 White asbestos (chrysotile, biotite)

3. Micas (muscovite and margarite)

4 Montmoritlonstes (Fullers earth, bentonite and vermiculite)

 

Consider how a two layer structure may be formed If we start wath 8
‘imple silicate sheet then one side of the sheet contains all the unshared
(smgly bound) O atoms The pure hydroxides A!{OH), and Mg(OH), both
exjstalize with layer structutes (and Al and Mg. are sx coordinate and
‘occupy octahedral sites) The unshared O sn a sikcate sheet have almost
