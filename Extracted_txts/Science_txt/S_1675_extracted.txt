the same relative positions as two thirds of the OH groups on each side of
these hydroxide layers. If a SiO; layer is placed alongside a layer of
y-gibbsite Al(OH)3, then many of the O atoms will coincide. The OH
groups in Al(OH); can be removed and an electrically neutral two-layer
structure is formed. These double layers stacked parallel give the mineral
kaolinite, which has the formula Al,(OH),[Si2O.]. It is a white solid and is
formed by the decomposition of granite. Large amounts are used for filling
paper, and as a refractory. World production of kaolinite was 22.5 million
tonnes in 1992 (USA 41%, UK 11%, and South Korea 8%). China clay or
kaolin is mined in Cornwall. It is a high grade ‘of kaolinite, and when
small amounts of SiO, and mica are removed it can be mixed with water
to give a white or nearly white plastic clay. Small amounts are used for
making porcelain, china cups and plates, sanitary ware, and other ceram-
ics, and for chromatography, as treatment for indigestion and for poultices.

One Al(OH); layer has two equivalent sides. A Si,Os layer was com-
bined with one side in kaolinite, but a second Si,O; sheet can combine
with the other side thus giving a three-layer structure. This is made up of
Silicate, Al(OH), silicate. Pyrophyllite Al,(OH)2[(Si2O;)2] has this three-
layer structure (Figure 13.16).

A layer of brucite Mg(OH), may be combined with a Si,Os layer to form
a two-layer structure. This gives the mineral chrysotile Mg;(OH).[Si20s]
