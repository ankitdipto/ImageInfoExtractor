triple sheets thus have a small negative charge. and 1/3 M* or 1/6 M?*
must be incorporated between the layers. These metal ions can be
hydrated, and the minerals are sometimes called hydromicas. Finely
divided particles suspended in water have thixotropic properties. The
particles are small plates with negative charges on the surface, and positive
charges on the edge. The particles are free to move in water, and they
arrange themselves + to — and thus give a semi-solid gel-like mass. If,
stirred the +/- attractions are broken, and the suspension becomes
watery, that is of lower viscosity. They are used in thixotropic non-drip
emulsion paints. These minerals can also act as ion exchangers. Fuller's
Earth is a calcium montmorillonite. It is very absorbant: about 4.2 million
tonnes were produced in 1992, mainly to decolorize and deodorize veget-
able and mineral oils, fats and waxes. It is also used to mop up oil spills,
and as litter for pet animals. It can act as an ion exchanger for Ca?*, and
replacement of Ca”* by Na* gives the mineral bentonite. This has marked
thixotropic properties and is used as drilling mud, and in water-based
emulsion paints (9.2 million tonnes of bentonite were produced in 1992).

If in talc Mgs(OH)s{(SizOs)2] substitution of Mg?* in the brucite
sheet occurs, and if also replacement of Si** with Al’* occurs in the
silicate sheet, then vermiculites are formed. A typical formula is
Na, (Mg, Al, Fe);(OH),[((Si, Al)2Os)2]-H.O. If vermiculites are heated
they dehydrate in an unusual way by extruding little worms: hence the
name. These materials are porous and light in weight, and are used for
packing and insulation, and as ‘soil’ for growing plants by ring culture.
About half a million tonnes are produced ‘each year.

  

Three-dimensional silicates

Sharing all four corners of a SiO, tetrahedron results in a three-
dimensional lattice of formula SiO» (quartz, tridymite. cristobalite etc.).
These contain no metal ions, but three-dimensional structures can form the
basis of silicate structures if there is isomorphous replacement of some of
the Si** by AP* plus an additional metal ion. This gives an infinite three-
dimensional lattice, and the additional cations occupy holes in the lattice.
Replacing one quarter of the Si** in SiO, with Al'* gives a framework ion
AlSi:0j. The cations are usually the larger metal ions such as K*, Na*,
Ca®* or Ba**. The smaller ions Fe**, Cr** and Mn2* which were common
in the chain and sheet silicates do not occur in the three-dimensional
silicates because the cavities in the lattice are too large. Replacements of
one quarter or one half of the Si atoms are quite common, giving structures
M{AISi:0,] and M"[AI;SizOg]. Such replacements result in three groups
of minerals:

1. feldspars

2. zeolites

3. ultramarines,
