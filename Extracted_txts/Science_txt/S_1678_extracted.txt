‘The feldspars are the most amportant rock forming minerals and con.
stitute two thirds of the rgneous rocks For example, granites made up
ff feldspars with some micas and quartz Feldspars are divided into two
asses

Onthoclase feldspars Plogroclase feldspars
orthoclase K[AISNO,} —albite.—NafAISHOs}
elsian —Ba[ALS1,O4] anorthite Caf ALS1,0x}

‘The orthoctases are more symmetneal than are plagioclases as K* and
Ba?* are just the right size to fit nto the lattice whilst Na* and Ca®*, being
smaller allow distortion

Zeolites have a much more open structure than the feldspars The anon
skeleton 1s penetrated by channels, gwing a honeycomblike structure
‘These channels are large enough to allow them to exchange certain 1ons
They can also absorb or lose water and other small molecules without
the structure breaking down Zeolites are often used as 1on exchange
materials, and as molecular sieves Natrolite Nas[Al;S1)J2H30 1 2
natural ron exchanger Petmunit water softeners use sodium zeoltes
Zeolites take Ca?” rons from hard water and replace them by Na° thereby
softening the water The sodium zeolite natrolite gradually becomes a
calenum zeolite, and eventually has to be regenerated by treatment witha
strong solution of NaC1_ whem the reverse process takes place In addition
to naturally occurring mineralsmany synthetic zeolites have been made
Zeolites also act as molecular sieves by absorbing molecules which are
small enough to enter the cavities, but not those which are too big to
enter They can absorb water, CO,, NH and EtOH, and they are usefal
for separating straight chain’ hydrocarbons from branched chain com

bbe made with pores of appropriate size to remove small molecules
