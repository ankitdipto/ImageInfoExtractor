expensive for general use, but is used in scientific instruments

“The temperature required for melting can be reduced by adding vans
oxides tothe melt, thus obtainung scare glass A number of oxides may be
used meluding NaO, K,0, MgO, CaO, BaO, BOs, ALO), PbO and

Prone to chemical attack Such glasses are widely used for laborate"Y
equipment as in Pyrex glassware

Glass 1s produced in very large amounts In 1991, 26 4 mullion tonnes of
glass for bottles was produced, and in addition 7 mullion tonnes of sheet
lass was produced This was used maunly as windows

Additives for fining, for decolorizing and for colouring may be vied
when making glass Fining agents such as NaNO or As,O, are added 10
