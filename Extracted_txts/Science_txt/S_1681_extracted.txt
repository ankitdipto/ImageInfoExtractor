 

ORGANOSILICON COMPOUNDS AND THE SILICONES

 

1. Silicon has little tendency to bond to itself (catenate) whilst carbon has a
strong tendency to do so. The largest chains formed by Si are contained
in SisF34 and SigHg, but these compounds are exceptional. This is
related to the weakness of Si—Si bonds in contrast to the strength of
C—C bonds (see Table 13.4).

2, Silicon does not form px—pn double bonds, whilst carbon does so

readily. (Note that a disilene Me,Si=SiMeH has been isolated, but

only by using matrix isolation methods with solid argon. Various
transient reaction species with Si=C and Si=N bonds are known, and

(Me,Si)Si=C(OSiMe3)(CioHis) exists as crystals at room tempera-

ture, and is stable in the absence of air. These are rare exceptions.)

Silicon forms a number of compounds containing px—dn double bonds

in which the silicon atom uses d orbitals (see later). :

Preparation of organosilicon compounds
There are several ways of forming Si—C bonds:
1. By a Grignard reaction
SiCl, + CH3MgCl > CH,SiCl,; + MgCl
CH;SiCl,; + CH3;MgCl > (CH3)2SiCl, + MgCl
(CH3)2SiCl, + CH3MgCl — (CH3)3SiCl + MgCl2
(CH3)3SiCI + CH3MgCl > (CH3),4Si + MgCl, -

This is useful in the laboratory, or on a small scale.
2. Using an organolithium compound

4LiR + SiCl, — SiR, + 4LiCl

This also is useful in the laboratory, and R may be alkyl or aryl.

3. By the Rochow ‘Direct Process’. Alkyl or aryl halides react directly with
a fluidized bed of silicon in the presence of large amounts (10%) of-a
copper catalyst.

Si + 2CH,CI Cu catalyst 280-30°C

(CH3)2SiCl,
This is the main industrial method for making methyl and phenyl
chlorosilanes which are of considerable commercial importance in the
Production of silicones. The yield is about 70%, with varying amounts
of other products: MeSiCl; (10%) and Me;SiCl (5%), and smaller
amounts of Me,Si and SiCl, and others such as MeSiHCl. Both
Grignard and direct methods yield a mixture of products, and very
careful fractionation is important as the boiling points are close:
Me;SiCl (S7.7°C), MeSiCl; (66.4°C) and Me2SiCl, (69.6°C).

+ Catalytic addition of Si—H to an alkene. This is a useful general
method, but is not applicable to making the methyl! and phenyl silanes
Tequired by the silicone industry.
