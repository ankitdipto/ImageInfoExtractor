“The silicones ate a gfoup of organosiicon polymers They have a vide
vanety of commercial Uses as fluids os, elastomers (rubbers) and resins
‘Annual producton 1 estimated as about 300000 tonnes/year ‘They are
tow produced on a lager sale than any other group of organometallic
compounds

“The complete hydrolysis of SiCl,yelds 103, which has a very stable
three dimensional stricture ‘The fundamental research of F S.Kigpingon
the hydrolysis of allyl substituted chlorosianes led, not to the expected
‘icon compound analogous toa ketone. but to long chain polymers called
silicones
