Hydrolysis under carefully controlled conditions can produce cyclic
structures, with rings containing three, four, five or six Si atoms:

Hydrolysis of trimethylmonochlorosilane (CH3)3SiCI yields (CH;),;SiOH
trimethylsilanol as a volatile liquid, which can condense, giving hexa-

methyldisiloxane. Since this compound has no OH groups. it cannot poly-
merize any further.

If some (CHs3)3SiCI is mixed with (CH3)2SiCl, and hydrolysed, the
(CH,);SiCI will block the end of the straight chain produced by (CH3)2SiCly.
Since there is no longer a functional OH group at this end of the chain, it
cannot grow any more at this end. Eventually the other end will be blocked
in a similar way. Thus (CH3),SiCI is a chain stopping unit, and the ratio of

(CH);SiCI and (CH3),SiCl, in the starting mixture will determine the
average chain size.
