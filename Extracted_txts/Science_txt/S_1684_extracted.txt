Ina similar way addition of a small amount of CH,SiCis to the hydrolysis
rixture produces a few cross links or provides a site for attaching other
molecules By controlled mixing of the reactants any given type of
polymer can be produced

Silicones are farly expensive but have many desirable properties They
were originally developed as electrical msulators because they are more
stable to heat than are organic polymers and sf they do break dovn they
do not produce conducting matenals as carbon does. They are reststant
heat oxidation and most chemicals They are strongly water repellent are
good electrical insulators and have non stick properties and ant foaming
Dropertics ‘Their strength and mertness are related to two factors

Straight chain polymers of 20 to SiM) units are used as silicone fluds
‘They make up 63% of the silicones used If they are made by hvdrolsing»
mixture of (CH,):SiCh and (CH,),S:C1 then the chain lengths vary conv
