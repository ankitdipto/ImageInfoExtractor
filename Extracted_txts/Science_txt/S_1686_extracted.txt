‘Sthcon forms a hmited number of saturated hydrides, S},H2,42, called
the silanes These may exist as straight chains or branched chains, cof
taining up to eight Si atoms. Ring compounds are very rare. No analogues
of alkenes or ailynes are known Monosilane SiH, 1s the only sleet
hydride of importance SiH, and SIHCI, were first made by treating a
