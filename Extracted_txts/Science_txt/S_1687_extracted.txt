SiH, + (4+ MHZO LE, o8i0,-nH,0 + 7H:
Compounds with Si—H bonds undergo an important hydrosilation
reaction with alkenes, in the presence of a platinum catalyst. The re-
action is similar to hydroboration, and the products may be used to make
silicones.

RCH=CH, + SiHCl; > RCH,CH,SiCI3

The difference in behaviour between alkanes and silanes is attributed to
several factors:

1. Pauling’s electronegativity values are: C = 2.5, Si = 1.8. and H = 2.1.
Thus the bonding electrons between C and H or Si and H are not
equally shared, leaving a 6~ charge on Cand a 0* charge on Si. Thus Si
is vulnerable to attack by nucleophilic reagents.

2. The larger size of Si makes it easier to attack.

. Si has low energy d orbitals which may be used to form an intermediate

compound, and thus lower the activation energy of the process.

Several germanium hydrides or germanes Ge,,H>,,.2 are known up to
n = 3. They are straight chain compounds and are colourless gases or
volatile liquids. They are similar to the silanes, but are less volatile. less
flammable and are unaffected by water or aqueous acids or alkalis. GeHy
can be made:

Stannane SnH, is much less stable. It can be made by reducing SnCl, with
LifAIH,] or Na[BH4]. It is a strong reducing agent. It is unaffected by
water and dilute acids and alkali, but it rea¢ts slowly with concentrated
solutions. Distannane Sn2H. is known and is even less stable. No higher
stannanes are known. Plumbane PbH, is even Jess stable and even more
difficult to prepare. The preparative methods used for the other hydrides
fail. It has been made in trace amounts and at low concentrations by
cathodic reduction and detected using a mass spectrometer.

CYANIDES

The alkali metal cyanides, particularly NaCN, are made in quantity, about
120000 tonnes/year. Until about 1965 it was made by the Castner process

by high temperature reactions from sodamide.
