‘THE GROUP 1¢ ELEMENTS:

 

Since 1965 hydrogen cyanide HCN has become commercially aval
able (currently 300000 tonnes/year) NaCN 1s made from this HN was
formerly prepared by acidification of NaCN or Ca(CN)y
2NaCN + H:S0,—+ HCN + NaS.
Ca(CN)> + 1:80, + 2HEN + CaSO.
In the modern industrial processes a gas phase reaction occurs between
‘CH, and NH, at about 1200°C sn the presence of a catalyst

Degussa process. CHy + Ny HCN + 3Hy (Pr catalyst)
Andeussow provess — 2CHs + 2NHy + 303+
2HCN + 610 (PUR catalyst)

HEN 1s extremely porsonous It has an abnormally high boiling port of
26°C because of hydrogen bonding. Its one of the weakest acids knosn
‘weaker than HF Over half the HCN produced 1s used to make the
polymer methyl methacrylate and the rematnder is used to make NaCN
(CICN). and various cyanide complexes such as Ki{Fe(CN}.] and
K\[Fo(CN),} and sn the extraction of Ag and Au

(CICN), + 3NHy— 3HCL-+ CNM(NHD), (melamine)

HICN has been used as a non aqueous rontzing solvent

Cyanide 1ons may act as both complexing and reducing agents
