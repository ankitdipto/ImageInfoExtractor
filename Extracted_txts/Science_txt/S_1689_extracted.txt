2Cu2* + ACN™ > (CN)2 + 2CUCN = [Cu(CN) I>

In this reaction the cyanide ion is itself oxidized to cyanogen (CN)2 in much
the same way as I” is oxidized to I, by Cu?*. In alkaline solution, cyanogen
disproportionates into cyanide and cyanate ions.

(CN), + 20H™ > H,O + CN™ + NCO™

The cyanate ion is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide; hence they have
similar structures and are both linear.

COMPLEXES

The ability to form complexes is favoured by a high charge, small size and
availability of empty orbitals of the right energy. Carbon is in the second
period and has a maximum of eight electrons in its outer shell. In four-
covalent compounds of carbon, the second shell contains the maximum of
eight electrons. Because this structure resembles that of a noble gas, these
compounds are stable, and carbon does not form complexes. Four-
covalent compounds of the subsequent elements can form complexes
due to the availability of d orbitals, and they generally increase their
coordination number from 4 to 6.

SiF, + 2F~ — [SiF,]?~
GeF, + 2NMe; — [GeFy-(NMes)2]
SnCl, + 2CI~ — [SnCle?-
The VSEPR theory suggests that because there are six outer electron pairs
these complexes will be octahedral. The valence bond theory requires that

four covalent and two coordinate bonds are formed and give an octahedral
structure. For example, [SiF,]?7:
