‘The Krebs cycle. This series of reactions takes place within the matrix of the mitochondrion. For the complete breakdown of a molecule
of glucose, the two molecules of acetyl-CoA produced by glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation will each have to make a trip around the Krebs
cycle. Follow the different carbons through the cycle, and notice the changes that occur in the carbon skeletons of the molecules as they

proceed through the cycle.
