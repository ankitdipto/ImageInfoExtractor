In tnsilylamne, three sp? orbitals are used for 6 bonding, gwing a plane
tnangular structure ‘The lone pair of electrons occupy a p orbital at ght
angles to the plane triangle Thus overlaps with empty d orbitals on each of
the three sition atoms, and results in x bonding, more accurately
desenbed as pdx Donding, because 11s from a fll p orbital to an empty
orbital “This shortens the bond lengths N—Si. Since the nitrogen no
longer has a lone pai of electrons, the molecule has no donor properties
Similar prdr bonding 1s impossible in (CH)3N because C does not
possess d orbitals and henee ths molecule 1s pyramidal About 200
