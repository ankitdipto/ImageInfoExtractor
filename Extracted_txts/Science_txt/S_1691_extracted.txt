TETRAHALIDES

All the tetrahalides are known except Pbl,. They are typically covalent,
tetrahedral, and very volatile. The exceptions are SnF, and PbF,, which
have three-dimensional structures and are high melting (SnF, sublimes at
705°C, PbF, melts at 600°C). The elements after C have d orbitals
available, and the Si-F, Si-Cl and Si-O bonds are stronger than the
corresponding bonds with C. This is thought to be due to the donation of
electrons from F, Cl or O to Si, giving rise to pn~dn bonding.

Carbon

Tetrafluoromethane (carbon tetrafluoride) CF, is an exceptionally unre-
active gas. It can be made as follows:
CO, + SFy—> CF, + SO,
SiC + 2F, — SiF, + CF,
CF,Cl + Fr. CF, + Cly (industrial method)

Other fluorine compounds such as hexafluoroethane CF, and tetrafluoro-
ethylene C,F, are known. Under pressure C,F, polymerizes to (C,F4),,

giving polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE. This is a hard, white solid plastic’

with a greasy feel to the touch, and is much heavier (more dense) than one
would expect. It is a good electrical insulator, and is chemically inert. It is
expensive, and is used in the laboratory because of its inertness. It has a
Very low coefficient of friction and is used for coating non-stick pans and
sazor blades. Fluorocarbons are useful lubricants, solvents and insulators.
