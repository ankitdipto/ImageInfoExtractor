“The carbon halides are not hydrolysed under normal conditons because
they have no d orbitals, and cannot form a five coordinate hydrolysis
intermediate In contrast the silicon halides hydrolyse readily Sihcon has
3d orbitals avanable, and these may be used to coordinate OH sons or
‘water as a first step in hydrolysis. In any atom there are always empty
orbitals, but these are usually too high in energy to be used If suffirent
energy is provided by using superheated steam then CCl, will hydrolyse

1s used to make isocyanates for the manufacture of polyurethanes

Freons

Mixed chlorofluorocarbons (sometimes called CFCs) such as CPCs
CFC and CFiCi ate known as Freons. They are unreactive and nen
tonic and are widely used as refngeration fluids, as the propellant in
aerosols, and for washing computer boards At one time, neerly 700000
tonnes of Freons were produced annually, though production had fallen
10 100000 tonnes 1m 1992 Despite being inert they cause environmental
damage Their use mn aerosols was banned sn the USA mn 1980, and in
Europe ftom 1990 They are still used in refeigerators, and a total ban on
Freons in Europe 1s planned by the year 2000

Freons are very much more effective ‘greenhouse gases" in the atmos
Phere than 1s CO., though the amount of Freons present 1s extremely
small Much more senously, the Freons have penetrated the upper afmos
phere (5~20 miles high), and are causing damage to the ozone layer There
has been a loss of about 6% of the azone between 1980 and 1990 A hole in
the ozone layer has appeared over the South Pole, and a sumilar hole seems
to be developing over the North Pole ‘The ozone layer 1s important as
filters the radiation from the sun and prevents most of the harmful UV
