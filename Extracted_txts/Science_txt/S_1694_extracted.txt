SiFg + 2HF + 2H" + [SiFa}~

SiCl, 8 commercially important Small amounts are used to make wlira
pure Si for transistors Large quantities of SiCly are hydrolysed at a igh
temperature (mn an oxy hydrogen flame) gwng very finely powdered S10;
rather than Si(OH),. This ultrafine SiO» 1s used as a thoxotropie agent ra
polyester and epoxy paints and resins, and as an inert filer in sieone
rubber

Other members of the series Si-Xane2 can be produced by pyrolys
(strong heating) ‘These are exher volatile iquids or solids The longest
chains known are SiFse, SCs and Si«Brio The chains are longer than
those formed in the hydrides This 1s due to pr-dx bonding from full
halogen p orbitals with d orbitals on St

SiCly + St—+ Si:Cl, + higher members of the senes (SuCha)

Germanium, tn and lead

Ge, Sn and Pb form twa series of halides, MX, and MX With Ge te
HIV) oxidation states the most stable, but with Pb the (HI) state the
most stable

‘The tetrahaldes are all colourless volatile liquids except for Gele and
Sl, which ate bright orange sohds. Compounds formed by the mann gp
elements are normally white Colour ts associated wath eletrons beg
promoted from one energy level to anather, and absorbing or emuti the
energy difference between the two levels This 1s common in the tranton
elements, where there ate often unhiled energy levels n the d Sell
allowing promotion from one d level to another In she main groups, thes
and p electron shells are normaly filed when a compound i formed. 50
promotion within the same shell = not possible Promotion from one sll
to another, for example from the 2p to the 3p level, ynvolves so much
‘energy shal absorption nes would sppeat mn the vliraaghet sates 0
the visible region. Thus the tetrahalides would be expected to be wite 8
colour ‘The orange colour of Snl 1s caused by the absorption of bluc ht
the reflected light thus contaimng a higher proportion of red and ortnge
‘The energy absorbed in this way causes the transfer ofan elect fom 10
Sn_ (This corresponds to the temporary reduction of Sn(1V) to Sn(l)))
Since transfernng an electron to another atom is transferring a eb8°BE
such spectra are called charge ansferspecira Ths curs in Sal, and Gel
because the atoms have simular energy levels This would be expected
because they are close m the periodic table, and have simlarstes Chatet
transfer spectra do not occur with the other halides

GeCl,and GeBr, are hydrolysed less readily SnClzand PCL hyde
1m dilute solutions, but hydrolyss soften incomplete and canbe repre
by the additon of the appropriate halogen acid
