 

DIHALIDES

In the presence of excess acid, halides of Si, Ge, Sn and Pb increase their
coordination number from 4 to 6, and form complex ions, such as [SiF.]?~.
(GeF¢)*", [SnCl,]?~ and [SnCis]~. Pbls is not known, probably because of
the oxidizing, power of Pb(+IV) and the reducing power of I~, which
results in PbI, always being formed.

Catenated halides

Carbon forms a number of catenated halides, perhaps the best known
being Tefion or polytetrafluoroethylene, which is described above. The
polymers formed have chain lengths of several hundred carbon atoms

Silicon forms polymers (SiF2),, and (SiCl,), by passing the tetrahalide
over heated silicon. These polymers decompose on heating into low mol-
ecular weight polymers (or oligomers) of formula Si,X2,+2. The longest
chains known are SijgF3a, SisClig and SigBryo.

Germanium forms the dimer Ge2Cl,, but Sn and Pb do not form any
catenated halides.

DIHALIDES
There is a steady increase in the stability of dihalides:
CX, « SIX, < GeX2 < SnX2 < PbX2

SiF, can be made by high temperature reactions, and can be trapped by
cooling in liquid No. When the product warms up, polymerization occurs
giving a range of compounds up to SijgFas-

based on a trigonal bipyramid. GeF, units share two F atoms (giving the
formula GeF,), and the Ge also forms a weaker interaction to another F.
with a lone pair in the fifth position. These units are linked into infinite
spiral chains. SaF, and SnCl, are white solids, and are obtained by heat-
ing Sn or SnO with gaseous HF or HCI. Stannous fluoride SnF, was used
together with tin pyrophosphate Sn2P2O; in the original ‘Crest’ fluoride
toothpaste. This is surprising as Sn is toxic, and NaF is now used instead.
The crystal structure of SnF, is made of Sn4Fg tetramers. These form an
eight-membered puckered ring —-Sn—F—Sn—F—, with weaker inter-
actions linking the rings together. SnCl, partly hydrolyses in water,
forming the basic chloride Sn(OH)CI. SnF, and SnCl, both dissolve in
solutions containing halide ions.
