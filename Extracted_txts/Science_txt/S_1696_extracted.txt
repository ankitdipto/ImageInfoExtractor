CLUSTER COMPOUNDS

‘There 1s a well estabished tendency for the heavier members of Groups
14-15 and 16 to form polyatomic tons These may be chains rings or
clusters

Reduction of Ge Sn and Pb by Na an liquid ammonia gives metal rons
containing several atoms. These have been shown to be metal clusters
Crystalline compounds containing such ons can be solated by forming
complexes with ethylenediamine. or with eryptand 22 hgands Examples
include (Na(eryptand 222)|* [Snel” _ (Na(cryptand 222)|F (Pb)
[Nax(en).Ges] and [Nas(en)<Sn,} ‘The shape of Me clusters 18 9 tigonal
bipyramid and My clusters are umicapped square ant prisms (The latter
consists of a square anti prsm 1¢ a cube with the top face with four
comers rotated 45° relatwve to the bottom face Uncapped means an extra
atom projects from one of the faces )

REACTION MECHANISMS

Many iorgame reactions sucks as double decomposition involve only
tons and these occur virtually mstantaneously Typically organic reachons
are slower because they involve breaking covalent bonds and they oxcur
ether by substituting one group for another or by adding on an extra
{r0up to give an intermediate which then eliminates another group to ve
the product

‘The hydrolysis of SiC 8 rapid because Si can use ad orbital to form a
five coordinate termediate and the reaction occurs by an S42 mechan
asm (Figure 13 20) A Jone pair of electrons from the oxygen 1s donated 19
‘an empty d orbital on Si forming a five coordinate intermediate which has

a thigonal bipyramidal structure )
