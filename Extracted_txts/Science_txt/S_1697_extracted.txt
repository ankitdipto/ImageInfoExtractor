If the hydrolysis is performed on an asymmetrically substituted, and con-
sequently optically active, silicon compound such as MeEtPhSi*Cl, then
Walden inversion will occur, resulting in inversion of the structure from
d to / or vice versa (Figure 13.21). In a similar way, the reduction of
R,R,R; Si*Cl with Li[AlH,] to give R,R2R; Si*H also involves inversion
of structure.

Other mechanisms are possible because the conversion of R;R2R3Si*H

to R:R2R,Si*Cl occurs with the retention of structure. If RjR2R3Si*Cl is
dissolved in ether or CCl, it is recovered unchanged, but dissolving in
CHSCN results in racemization.

ORGANIC DERIVATIVES

The elements of this group have an extensive organometallic chemistry.
The divalent state becomes increasingly stable and important on descend-
ing the group (the inert pair effect), yet rather surprisingly the organo-
metallic derivatives of Sn and Pb all contain M'Y and not M!!.

The alkyl silicon chlorides are important as the starting materials for
the manufacture of silicones. The silicone polymers have already been
described. Tetra organic derivatives of Si, Ge, Sn and Pb may be prepared
from the halides using Grignard or organolithium reagents.
