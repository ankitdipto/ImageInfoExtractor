PROBLEMS [467]

Why is CCl, unaffected by water whilst SiCl, is rapidly hydrolysed? Is
‘CCl, unreactive towards superheated steam?

Compare the shapes of the following pairs of molecules or ions, and
suggest reasons for the differences in each pair:

(a) CCl, and TeCl,

(b) CO, and NO,

(c) SiF, and ICIz :

Why is SnI, an orange coloured solid when CCl, and SiBry are
colourless liquids?

Starting with labelled BaCO; (containing '*C), how would you prepare
labelled NazCO3, CaCO3, CaC,, CaNCN, C2H2, CH3OH, CS, and
Ni(CO),.

How is CS; made, and what is it used for?

How are NaCN and (CN)2 made? What is NaCN used for?

Give two preparations for monosilane and compare its chemical
properties with those of CH4. Explain any differences.

Give three examples of Freons. How are they made, what are they
used for, and how do they damage the environment?

Compare and contrast the structures of trimethylamine and tri-
silylamine.

Draw the structures of six different types of silicate and give the name
and formula of one example of each type.

Describe the uses of soluble sodium silicates.

Describe the use of zeolites as water softeners.

How are silicate impurities removed in the extraction of Al and Fe?
Describe two commercial methods for manufacturing alkyl substi-
tuted chlorosilanes. How are the reaction products separated and how
may polymers with almost any specified properties be prepared from
them?

How can silicates be detected in qualitative analysis?

What are the main ores of Sn and Pb, and how are the metals
extracted?

. Give equations to show the reactions between Sn and: (a) H(iq),

(b) NaOH, (c) HNO;, (d) Oo, (e) Ch.
What are the main uses of lead’?
What is red lead, and what is it used for?

What are the main sources of lead pollution, what can be done about
them, and what are the effects of lead on humans?

How would you make lead tetra-acetate? What is its structure, and
what is it used for?
Describe the changes in physical and chemical properties which may

be observed in the elements C, Si, Ge, Sn and Pb. Give reasons for
these changes.
