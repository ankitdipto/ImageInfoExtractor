ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND OXIDATION STATES

“The elements of ths group all have five electrons in their outer shell They
exhibit a maximum oxidation sate of five towards oxygen by using al five
‘outer electrons im forming bonds The tendency for the pur of s electrons
to remain inert (the mert pair effect) increases with increasing atomie
sweight Thus only the p electrons are used in bonding and tnvalency
results Valencies of three and five are shown with the halogens and wth
sulphur The hydrides are trivatent Nitrogen exhibits a very wide range of
oxidation states (11) in ammonia Ny (I) sn hydrazine oH, (=)10
hydroxylamine NHOH, (0) an dinutcogen No. (+1) in niteous oxide NiO,
GD in ovine oxrde NO. (41M) in nitrous acid HNO>, (+1¥) in avtrogen
‘Giovide NO and (+V) in nitric acid HNOx. The negative oxidation states
sanse because the electtonegativity of H = 2 {and tht for N= 30
