Phosphorus

Phosphorus 1s the eleventh most abundant element sn the earths crust
Phosphorus 1s essential for Ife, both as a structural material on higher
animals, and inthe essential metabolism of both plants and animals About
{60% of bones and teeth are Cas(POx); or [3(Cas(PO,):) CaF} and an
average person has 8lbs (3 5ke) of calcium phosphate in hus body Nuclse
aerds such as DNA and RNA contain the genetic materal for each cll
These nucleic acids are mtade up of polyester chains of phosphates and
sugars with organic bases (adenine, cytosine, thymine and guamine) Phos
phorus, in the form of adenosine triphosphate ATP and adenosine dt
phosphate ADP, 1 of vital importance for the production of energy 12
cells When water splits a phosphate group off ATP, forming ADP.
33KI mole”! of energy s released

‘Vast amounts of phosphates are used 1n fertlzers World production of
phosphate cock was 145 malhon tonnes in 1992 (USA 32%, Chins 18%,
Soviet Union 15%, and Morocco 13%) Most 1s mined as fluoroapatite
13Cas(PO.)3}-CaF;], but some 1s found as hydroxyapatite [3Cax(POd:
Ca(OH] and chloroapatte [3Cax(PO,)3-CaCla] where OH” and O
are substituted for F™ sn the crystal structure About 90% of phosphate
tock 1s used directly 10 make fertilizers, and the remainder 15 used 10
make phosphorus and phosphone acid
