aulhion tonnes of NH produced in 1992 by man (mainly by the Haber~
Bosch process, but some from the distillation of coal) The most
important genus of bacteria 1s Rhizobium These live symbrotically 1
the nodules of roots of plants 1m the family Leguminosae, 1 pest,
beans, clover and alder trees Other mitrfying bactera lie free an the
soil for example the blue-green bacteria Anabena and Nostoc, aerobic
bacteria such as Azotobacter and Beyerinckia, and anaerobic bacteta
such as Closirdwm pastonanum These bacteria requite traces of
certain transition metals such as Mo, Fe, Co and Cu from the soi, and
also B The mitrogen fixing enzyme ‘nitrogenase’ was rsolated from
CClostrdwum pastorianum in 1960 the same enzyme system 1s respon
sible for nitrogen fixation inthe other bacteria too

Nitrogenase contains two components One 1s a Mo~Fe protein of
molecular weight 220000, containing 24~32 Fe, two Mo and 2 labile
sulphide group, and the other 1s an Fe protein of molecular weight
£60000, containing four Fe and four $ Nitrogenase reduces Ny to Ni
and the Ny 15 thought to form a complex with the Mo~Fe protem
Bonding in Nz complexes favours end on coordination to the metal @
donation from N to the metal 1s more smportant than x back bonding
from the metal to NNiteagenase also reduces NO, RCN and Ny (@
NH and xt also reduces ethyne CyHs to ethene CH,

NaNO) which 1s mined and used as fertizer

4. Minor gains come from the effects of lightning, and from photochemical
changes Lightning may cause Nz and Oy in the ait to form NO std
NO; This 1s essentially similar to the obsolete Birkeland-Eyde
process The strong UV radiation in the upper atmosphere may ease
similar photochemical changes, giving oxides of nitrogen. The N
formed forms a very dilute solution of HNOs in rain water.
