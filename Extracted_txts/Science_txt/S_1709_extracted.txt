Figure 14.2 The structure of black phosphorus. The atoms are arranged in
corrugated planes in crystalline black phosphorus (Van Wazer, J.R., Phosphorus
and Its Compounds, Vol.I, Interscience, New York — London, 1958, p.121).

molecules, which have a bond energy of 489.6kJ mol~'. (This is only half
the value for N2 because the orbitals in the third shell are much larger and
give relatively poor px—pm overlap.) If white phosphorus is heated to
about 250°C, or a lower temperature in the presence of sunlight, then red
phosphorus is formed. This is a polymeric solid, which is much less reactive
than white phosphorus. It is stable in air and does not ignite unless it is
heated to 400°C. It need not be stored under water. It is insoluble in
organic solvents. Heating white phosphorus under high pressure results in
a highly polymerized form of P called black phosphorus. This is‘thermo-
dynamically the most stable allotrope. It is inert and has a layer structure
(Figure 14.2). Other more doubtful allotropes have been reported.

Arsenic, antimony and bismuth

Solid As, Sb and Bi each exist in several allotropic forms. Arsenic vapour
contains tetrahedral As, molecules. A reactive yellow form of the solid
resembles white phosphorus and is thought to contain tetrahedral As,
units. Sb also has a yellow form. All three elements have much less reactive
metallic or a-forms. These have layer structures, but the layers are
