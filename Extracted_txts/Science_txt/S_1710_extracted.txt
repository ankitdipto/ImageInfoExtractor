puckered Another allotrope of Sb that 1s formed at high pressure has 2
hexagonal close packed structure A high pressure form of Br has a body
centred cubse structure Bismuth 1s unusual because the liquid expands
when st forms the solid This unusual behaviour 1s also found with Ga
and Ge

used to form a coordinate bond) to another atom or ion An examples the

I requires too much energy to remove all five outer electrons so M**
rons are not formed However Sb and Bi can lose gust three electrons
