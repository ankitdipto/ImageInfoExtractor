‘THE GROUP 15 ELEMENTS: 7

 

In the appearance and structures of the elements
By thear tendency to form positive tons

By the nature of their oxides. Metallic oxides are typically bast, and
‘non metallic oxides are acidic Thus the normal oxides of N and P are
strongly acidic, whereas those of As and Sb are amphotensc and that of
Bras largely basic

4. The electncal resistivty of the metathe forms (a-As 33, « Sb 39 and
@-B1 106yohmem) are much lower than for white phosphorus (I x
407 yohmem), indicating an increase in metallic properties. However,
the resistivity values are higher than the values for a good conductor
such as Cu, 1 67yohmem, and higher than Sn, 11, and Pb, 20jiohmem

an the adyaeent group (See Appendix )

REACTIVITY

Dimitrogen 15 relatively unreactive, which 1s why 1t has accumulated 19
such farge amovnts in the atmosphere

‘White phosphorus catches fire when exposed to ait, burning to form
P,Oq Itis stored under water to prevent this Red phosphorus s stable m
air at room temperature, though it reacts on heating

‘Arsenicis stable mn dry a, but tarnishes n morst air giving fist a bronze
‘then a black tarnish When heated i air it sublimes at 615°C and forms
‘AsiOg, not AsO» Strong heating in dioxyzen can gwve enter of these
‘oxides, depending on the amount of dioxygen present. This reluctance 19
attatn the maximura oxidation state for the group 1s found inthe elements
Ga, As, Se and Br, that isn the elements immediately following the filing
of the first d shell’ AsiOjo and HyAsO, are used as oxidizing agents im
volumetne analysis

‘Sb 1s less reactive, and as stable towards water and to air at room
temperature On heating an air t forms Sb,O, SbiOs or SbyOo Bi forms
Bi,O3 on heating

 

HYDRIDES

‘The elements all form volatile hydrides of formula MH3, which are all
poisonous, foul smelling gases On descending the group from Ni
BiHy

‘The hydndes become increasingly dificult to prepare
‘Their stabuity decreases

“Ther reducing power increases

‘The ease of replacing the hydrogen atoms by other groups such as Clor
Me decreases

‘Their ability to act as electron donors, using the lone pair of electrons
for coordinate bond formation, decreases
