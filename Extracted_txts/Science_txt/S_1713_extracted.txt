Ammonia NH3

NH; is a colourless gas with a pungent odour. The gas is quite poisonous. It
dissolves very readily in water with the evolution of heat. At 20°C and one
atmosphere pressure 53.1 g NH; dissolves in 100g water. This corresponds
to 702 volumes of NH; dissolving in 1 volume of H20. In solution ammonia
forms ammonium hydroxide NH,OH, and behaves as a weak base.

NH; + HO = NH{+OH7 = K = 1.8 x 10° moll!

NH; and NH,OH both react with acids, forming ammonium salts. These
salts resemble potassium salts in solubility and in their crystal structures.
Like the Group 1 salts, ammonium salts are typically colourless. There are
some differences. Ammonium salts are usually slightly acidic if they have
been formed with strong acids such as HNO3, HCl and H2SO,, since
NH,OH is only a weak base. Ammonium salts decompose quite readily on
heating. If the anion is not particularly oxidizing (e.g. Cl”, CO3- or S027)
then ammonia is evolved:

If the anion is more oxidizing (e.g. NOz, NO3, ClOz, Cr,037) then NH
is oxidized to Nz or N20.

NH; burns in dioxygen with a pale yellow flame:
4NH3 + 302 > 2N2 + 3H,0
The same reaction occurs in air, but the heat of reaction is insufficient to
maintain combustion unless heat is supplied, for example in a gas flame.
Certain mixtures of NH3/O2 and NH;/air are explosive.
NH; is prepared in the laboratory by heating an ammonium salt with
NaOH. This is a standard test in the laboratory for NHt compounds.
NH,Cl + NaOH > NaCl + NH; + H,0
The NH; evolved may be detected:

1. By its characteristic smell.
2 By turning moist litmus paper blue.
. By reaming dense white clouds of NH,Cl with the stopper from a bottle

4. By forming a yellow-orange—brown precipitate with Nessler’s solution.
