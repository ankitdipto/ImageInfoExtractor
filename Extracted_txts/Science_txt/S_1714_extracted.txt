World production of NH was 110 milion tonnes in 1992 Most was
manufactured synthetically from Hs and Nz by the Haber—Bosch process
(Gee later) but some was obtamed {rom coal gas purification and during
‘coke production from coal Ammonia can also be obtained from the
Inydrolyss of calewum cyanamide, CaNCN Calcrum eyanannide 1s usualy
used as a fertilizer, and this reaction oceuts slowly an the soul

CaNCN + 3H,0 -> 2NHy + CaCOs

(CaNEN 1s also used to make melamine, urea and thiourea ~ See Chaptét
11 ) Inthe past when town gas was made 2s a fuel by dry distling coal it
the absence of air any aurogenous compounds n coal were converted nf0
NH, This NEY was obtained as a by product

Ammonium salts

Ammonium salts ate all very soluble m water They all react with NaOH,
hiberating NHs ‘The NHz son 1s tetrahedral Several ammonium salts af€
tmportant

'NH,CI 1s well known At one time st was obtained by heating cam!
dung NH.C1 1s easily purified by sublimation’ Tt can be recovered as 2
by product from the Solvay process. It 1s used an “dry batteries’ of the
Leclanché type Its also used as a flux when tinning or soldering metals
since many metal oxides react with NHCI forming volatile chlorides thes
leaving a clean metal surface

NHANOs 1s used in enormous amounts as a nitrogenous fertilizer It
eliquescent Because i can cause explosions itis often mixed with CaCOs
for (NH);:SOx to make it safe It 1s also used as an explosive, since 6
strong heating (above 300°C) or with a detonator, very rapid decompost
tion occurs The solid has almost zero volume and it produces seve
volumes of gas. this causes the explosion

2NHNO\—+ 2N; + Op + 41,0

‘Smaller amounts of (NH,)2SO, are also used as a fertilizer At one tum?
(NH.),SO, was obtained as a by product from making coal gas (town g38)
‘Since natural gas has become available in developed countries tovin ges

zo longer made (NH,),50s 1s made by passing NH and CO; gases into
slurry of CaSOy in water

 

2NHy + C02 + 430 — (NH,):CO5
(NH,),CO; + CaSO,» CaCOs + (NH.):S05

Small amounts of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (NH,)sHPO, 3?
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH«H,PO, are used as feruzers THEY
are also used for fireproofing wood, paper and textiles NH,C1O, 1s used
an oxidizing agent in sotid fuel rocket propellants,
