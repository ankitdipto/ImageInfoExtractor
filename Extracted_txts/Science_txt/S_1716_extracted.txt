‘The hydndes PHy, AsHs and SDB, would be expected to be simi
However, the bond pais of electrons are moth further away from the
central atom than they are m NH ‘Thus the lone pair causes even greater
distortion in PH3, AsHs anid SbH, The bond angle decreases 10 91°18
(Table 14.6) These bond angles suggest that in PH, AsHs, SbHy and
Bil the orbitals used for bonding are close to pure p orbitals

‘The melung and boing pomnts of the hydrides increase from PH
through AsH to SbHs The values for NH, seem out of line with ths
‘tend one might have expected the boiling point of NH3 to be ~110°C or
120°C The reason why NH has a higher bosling point ands much ess
volatile than expected is that 11s hydrogen bonded inthe liquid state The
other hydndes do not form hydrogen bonds

‘These hydndes are strong reducing agents and react with solutions of
metal ons to give phosphides, arsenides and subnides They are flammable
and extremely porsonous

Donor properties

NH can donate us tone parr of electrons quite strongly to form complexes
Thus ammonia forms ammonium NHS salts, and also coordination
complexes with metal 107s from the Co, Ni, Cu and Zn groups, for
example the (Co(NHs)s}* 10n, very readily

'PH, acts as an electon donor and forms numerous complexes such a8
