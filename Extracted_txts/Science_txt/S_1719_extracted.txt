The modern industrial process runs continuously rather than as a batch
process. A dilute aqueous solution containing a 30-1 ratio of NH,OH and
NaOCl and gelatin is passed rapidly at high pressure through a reactor at
150°C. Conversion is about 60%, and a 0.5% solution of hydrazine is
obtained. The excess NH; is stripped off and recycled. The hydrazine is
concentrated by distillation yielding N2H4-H2O, or by adding H2SO, to
precipitate the salt NoH4- H2SO,.

Electron diffraction and infrared data indicate that the structure of
hydrazine is related to that of ethane. Each N atom is tetrahedrally
surrounded by one N, two H and a lone pair. The two halves of the
molecule are rotated 95° about the N—-N bond and adont a gauche (non-
eclipsed) conformation. The N—N bond length is 1.45 A.

Phosphorus forms an unstable hydride P2H4, which has very little
chemical similarity to N2H,.

Hydroxylamine NH2OH

Hydroxylamine forms colourless crystals that melt at 33°C. It is thermally
unstable and decomposes into NH3, N2, HNO; and N2O easily. It explodes
if heated strongly. It is usually handled in aqueous solution, or as one of its
salts, since these are more stable than free NH.OH,

Hydroxylamine is a Weaker base than is ammonia or hydrazine. Salts
contain the hydroxylammonium ion [NH;OH]*.

NHOH + HCl -— [NH,OH]*CI-
NH,OH + H,SO, — [NH,OH]*HSO;

The appropriate reduction potentials (see page 490) suggest that hy-

droxylamine should disproportionate. It disproportionates slowly in acidic
solutions:

-1 41 -
4[NH,OH - H]* — NO + 2NH} + 2H* + 3H30
and rapidly in alkaline solutions:

-I 0 -i
3NH.OH — N, + NH; + 3H,0

Both NH2OH and its salts are very poisonous, and they are also strong
Teducing agents.
Hydroxylamine is manufactured by reducing nitrites, or from nitro-
methane:
NH.NO, + NHHSO; + SO, + 2H,O — [NH;OH]*HSO; + (NH«)2SO4
CH3NO, + H2SO, > [NH;OH]*HSO; + CO

Pydroxylamine has donor properties (like NH; and N2H,): the N atom can
orm coordinate bonds, and can complex with metals. In addition it adds
