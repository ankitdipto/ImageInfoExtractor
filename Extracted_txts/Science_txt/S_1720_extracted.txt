LIQUID AMMONIA AS A SOLVENT
‘Ammonia gas 1s easly condensed (boiling point ~33°C) to give lige!
ammonia Liquid ammoma is the most studied non aqueous solvent and st
resembles the aqueous system quite closely Liquid ammonia, ike wate
‘ll dissolve a wide vanely of salts Both water and ammonia undergo self
ronzation
2H,0 = H,0* + OH™
2NHy = NH] + NHy
Thus, substances which produce HyO* tons in water are acids, afd
ammonium salts are acids im liquid ammonta Similarly, substances pr
ducing OH™ in water or NHS an quid ammonia are bases in that solve

In a similar way, precipitation reactions occur in both solven!s

However, the direction of the reaction 1s a function of the solvent
