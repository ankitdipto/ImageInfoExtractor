Liquid ammonia is an extremely good solvent for the alkali metals and
the heavier Group 2 metals Ca, Sr and Ba. The metals are very soluble
and solutions in liquid ammonia have a conductivity comparable to that of
pure metals. The ammonia solvates the metal ions, but is resistant to
reduction by the free electrons. These solutions of metals in liquid
ammonia are very good reducing agents because of the presence of free
electrons.

Solutions of ammonium salts in liquid ammonia are used to clean the
cooling systems in some nuclear reactors. Liquid sodium is used to cool fast
breeder nuclear reactors, such as that at Dounreay in Scotland. Liquid
ammonia is a good solvent for metals, but the surfaces are left wet with
NH3. When this evaporates it may leave a trace of finely divided sodium
which is pyrophoric. Thus it is necessary to destroy the sodium by using an
acid such as an ammonium salt in liquid ammonia.

; Because liquid ammonia accepts protons readily, it enhances the
ionization of so-called weak acids such as acetic acid.

CH;:COOH = CH;-COO™ + H*

The NH; removes H* and thus causes the reaction to proceed in the
forward direction. Thus acetic acid has a pX, value of 5 in water but is
almost completely ionized in liquid ammonia. Ammonia thus reduces the
difference between the strengths of acids. In this respect ammonia is called
a levelling solvent (see Chapter 8, under Acids and bases).

HYDROGEN AZIDE AND THE AZIDES

Hydrogen azide HN3 (formerly called hydrazoic acid) is a colourless liquid
