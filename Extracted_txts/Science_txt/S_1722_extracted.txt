Covalent azides are used as detonators and explosives lonte azides are
usually much more stable, and some are used as organic intermediates and
dyestuffs

‘The most mportant method of making azides ss by passing nitrous onde
gas into fused sodamide at 190°C under anhydrous conditions The water
vapour produced reacts with more sodamide Alternatively mitrous oxide
‘can be passed into a solution of sodamude 1n quid ammonia as a solvent

‘The sodium azide so obtained may be converted to hydrogen azide by
treatment with H;S0 followed by distillation Lead azide Pb(N%)s can be
