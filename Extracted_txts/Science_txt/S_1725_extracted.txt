cyanobacteria can ‘fix’ atmospheric dinitrogen, that is can convert N2 gas
into combined forms. These bacteria can have a great effect on the fertility
of soil by producing ‘combined nitrogen’. The most important nitrogen
fixing genus of bacteria is called Rhizobium. It lives symbiotically in the
nodules on the roots of plants in the family Leguminosae, e.g. peas,
beans, clover and alder trees. Other bacteria exist in the soil near roots,
and are also able to fix dinitrogen, but in smaller amounts (see ‘Nitrogen
cycle’).

Though plants require nitrates, bacteria in the soil will readily convert
other nitrogenous compounds into nitrates.

Chemical processes involving the fixation of atmospheric dinitrogen
include the Haber—Bosch process for ammonia, and the formation of
calcium cyanamide, which both involve the use of high temperatures and
pressure. Bacteria can fix dinitrogen easily at room temperature and atmos-
pheric pressure, yet man requires expensive plant with high temperatures
and pressures to do the same.

There is considerable research interest into finding transition metal
catalysed systems which will absorb dinitrogen and produce ammonia for
fertilizers cheaply and without the necessity for high temperatures or pres-
sure. The first dinitrogen complex, the pentaammine(dinitrogen)ruthenium
cation, was made in 1965 by reducing ruthenium trichloride with
hydrazine. Other methods have now been found, e.g. replacement of a
labile ligand in a complex by N3. Dinitrogen complexes have now been
made for almost all the transition elements.

The formation of this stable dinitrogen complex led to studies with other
metals. Complexes with titanium(II) are the most promising, and reduction
of titanium alkoxides yields either ammonia or hydrazine. A complete

cycle ot Teactions for fixing atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia has been
reported:
