Cyanamide process

Production of calcium cyanamide exceeds 1 3 million tonnes/sear, and is
rising It m used in large amounts as a nitrogenous feruler, and as a
source of organic chemicals such as melamine

Haber--Bosch process

‘The most important commercial process isthe Haber~Bosch process Faz
Haber discovered how to make Nz and H; combine directly m the labora
tory He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemustry in 1918 Carl Bosch
‘was.a chemical engineer who developed the plant to make ammonia ung
this reaction on an industrial sale: He too was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry n 1931 for hs work on high pressure reactions

Nz + 3Hy = 2NHy + heat

 

‘The reactions reversible, and Le Chatelier's principle suggests that a Ingh
pressure and low temperature are required to dnve the reaction to the
Tight, and thus form NH A low temperature gives a higher percentage
‘conversion to NH, but the reaction 1s slow in reaching equihbrium, and a
catalyst ss requited In practice the conditions used are 200 atmospheres
pressure, a temperature of 380-450°C and a catalyst of promoted ron Its
‘more economic to use a higher temperature, so that equilibrium wll be
reached! much faster, even though this ges a lower percentage conver:
ston Ata temperature of about 400°C a 15% conversion is obtained with 8
single pass over the catalyst The gas mixture 1s cooled to condense liquid
[NH, and the unchanged muxture of Ny and H, gases srecycled. The plant
1s made of steel alloyed with Ni and Cr

The catalyst 1s made by fusing FeO, with KOH and a refractory
rmatenal such as MgO, SiO; or ALOs This 1s broken mto small lumps and
put into the ammonia convertor, where the FesO4 1s reduced to give all
crystals of ron ina refractory matrix This isthe active catalyst

‘The actual plant 1s more complicated than this one stage reaction
implies, since the No and Hy must be made before they can be converted to
NH The cost of His of great importance for the economy of the process
‘Onginally the H, required was produced by electrolysis of water This 82s
expensive, and a cheaper method using toke and water was then used
(water gas, producer gas) Nowadays the Hz 1s produced from hyd!
