carbons, either naptha or CH,, by reacting with steam at 750°C with a Ni
catalyst. All traces of S must be removed since these poison the catalyst.

CH, + 2H,0 = CO, + 4H2
CH, + H,O = CO + 3H,

Some air is added. The O2 burns with some of the Hz, thus leaving N2 to
give the required reaction ratio N2: H2 of 1:3.
(4Nz + Oz) + 2H2 = 4N2 + 2H20
ait
CO must also be removed as it too poisons the catalyst.
CO + H,0 = CO, + Hp

Finally the CO, is removed in a scrubber by means of a concentrated
solution of KyCOs, or ethanolamine.

World production of NH; has risen from about 1 million tonnes/year in
1950 to 110 million tonnes in 1992. This is not quite the largest tonnage of
any chemical produced, but since NH; has a very low molecular weight it
constitutes a larger amount of substance (moles) than any other chemical.
The largest producers are the USSR 27%, China 21%, the USA 18%,
Canada 4%, Romania 4%, the Netherlands 3%, Mexico 3%, West Ger-
many, Poland, Italy and East Germany 2% each.

About 75% of the ammonia is used as a fertilizer (30% direct application
of NH; gas or NH,OH to the soil, 20% NH,NOs, urea 15%, ammonium
phosphate 10%, (NH4).SO. 3%). Other uses include the following:

1, Making HNO3, which can be used to make NH4NO3; (fertilizer), or
explosives such as nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose and TNT. HNO3 can be
used for many other purposes.

2. Making caprolactam, which on polymerization forms nylon-6 (see
hydroxylamine).

3. Making hexamethylenediamine which is used in making nylon-6-6,
polyurethanes and polyamides.

4. Making hydrazine and hydroxylamine.

. Liquid NH; is often used as a cheaper and more convenient way of
transporting H2 than cylinders of compressed Hz gas. The Hz is
obtained from NH; by heating over a catalyst of finely divided Ni or Fe.

. Ammonia has been used as the cooling liquid in refrigerators. It has a
very high heat of vaporization, and convenient boiling and freezing
Points. With the environmental concern over using Freons in refrigera-
tors, this use of NH3 could increase.

sine widespread ‘use of nitrates as fertilizers greatly boosts crop yields.
ice nitrates are soluble, the run-off water into lakes and rivers also
Contains nitrates. This causes several problems.

1. It produces increased growth of algae and other aquatic plants, which

may clog up rivers and lakes, and may make mudbanks in estuaries turn
green.
