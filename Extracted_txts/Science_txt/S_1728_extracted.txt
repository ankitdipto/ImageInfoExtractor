2 There 1s concern that mrates are harmful mn danking water They cause
1 disease in babies called methaemoglobinaema, which reduces the
‘amount of oxygen ta the baby’s blood In extreme forms this causes the
“blue baby syndrome’ There 1s also concern that nitrates could be
lunked wath stomach cancer Because of this, the EEC have set a safety
Lumut of 25 ppm for nitrates in drinking water

3 There 1 some concern that demtnficaton to oxides of mitogen
particularly NzO, may harm the ozone layer

‘UREA

Urea is widely used asa mtrogenous fertizer Its very soluble, and hence
quick acting, but a 1s easy Washed away 1 has a very high mitrogen
content (46%) It1s manufactured from NH, and the reaction proceeds in
two stages

PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS

Phosphate rocks such as uoroapatite (3Cas(PO.): CaF] ate very 19
soluble, and thus are of no use to plants Superphosphate 1s made by treat
ang phosphate rock with concentrated H,SO, The acid salt Ca(H:PO)15
more soluble, and over a period of weeks the superphosphate wall dssohe
