It was formerly sold as ‘agene’ to bleach flour to make white bread. This
use declined rapidly when it was suspected that bread made from flour
bleached in this way sent dogs mad! NBr; and NI; are known only as their
unstable ammoniates NBr3-6NH3 and NI;-6NH3. The latter compound
can be made by dissolving I, in 0.880 NH,OH. It detonates unless excess
ammonia is present, and students are warned not to prepare this
compound. The other 16 trihalides are stable.

The trihalides are predominantly covalent and, like NH3, have a tetra-
hedral structure with one position occupied by a lone pair. The exceptions
ate BiF; which is ionic and the other halides of Bi and SbF3 which are
intermediate in character.

The trihalides typically hydrolyse readily with water, but the products
vary depending on the element:

NCI; + 4H,0 -+ NH,OH + 3HOCI
PCI; + 3H,0 > H3PO;3 + 3HCI
AsCl; + 3H20 — H3AsO3 + 3HCI
SbCl; + H,O — SbO* + 3CI~ + 2H*
BiCl; + H,O > BiO* + 3CIl~ + 2H*
They also react with NH3.
e.g. PCI; + 6NH3 > P(NH,)3 + 3NH,Cl

NF; behaves differently from the others. It is unreactive, rather like CF,,
and does not hydrolyse with water, dilute acids or alkali. It does react if
sparked with water vapour.

PF; is rather less reactive towards water and is more easily handled
than the other halides. The trihalides, particularly PF3, can act as donor
molecules using their lone pair to form a coordinate bond, for example in
Ni(PFs)s. In addition to this o bond, there is t backbonding from a filled
orbital on the metal to an empty d orbital on P, similar to the way CO
acts as a ligand. Ni(PF3)4 can be made from nickel carbonyl Ni(CO),.

Ni(CO), + 4PF3— Ni(PF3)4 + 4CO

Many trifluorophosphine complexes of the transition metals are known.
Much of the work was done by J. Chatt and his group at ICI. Though most
of the trihalides are made from the elements, PF; is made by the action of
CaF, (or other fluoride) on PCl3. PF; is a colourless, odourless gas, which
'S very toxic because it forms a complex with haemoglobin in the blood,
thus Starving the body of oxygen.

NF; has little tendency to act as a donor molecule. The molecule is
tetrahedral with one position occupied by a lone pair, and the bond angle
F-N—F is 102°30". However, the dipole moment is very low (0.23 Debye
units) compared with 1.47D for NHs. The highly electronegative F atoms
attract electrons, and these moments partly cancel the moment from the
‘one Pair, and this reduces both the dipole moment and its donor power.

The trihalides also show acceptor properties, and can accept an electron
