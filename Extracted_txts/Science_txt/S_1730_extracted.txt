Several of these phosphate derivatives are commercially important

1 Tnethyl phosphate 1s used in producing systemic insecticides

2. Trwtolyl phosphate 1s a petrol additwe

3. Triaryl phosphates and triocty! phosphate are used as plasters for
polyvinyt chloride

4 Tern butyl phosphate 1s used for solvent extraction
