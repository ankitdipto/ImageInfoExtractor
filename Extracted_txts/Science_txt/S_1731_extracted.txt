AsCls is highly reactive and unstable, and has only a temporary existence.
BiFs is highly reactive, and explodes with water, forming O; and F,0. It
oxidizes UF, to UF,, and BrF; to BrFs, and fluorinates hydrocarbons.
The pentahalides are prepared as follows:
3PCls + SASF; > 3PFs + SAsCl3
PCI; + Ch (in CCl4) > PCls
2As203 + 10F, — 4AsFs + 302
2Sb203 + 10F2 > 4SbFs + 302
2Bi + SF, > 2BiFs
These molecules have a trigonal bipyramid shape in the gas phase

(see Figure 14.7), as expected from the VSEPR theory for five pairs of
electrons.

five singly filled orbitals form o bonds
to five atoms, giving a trigonal bipyramid

The trigonal bipyramid is not a regular structure. Electron diffraction on
PF; gas shows that some bond angles are 90° and others are 120°, and the
axial P—F bond lengths are 1.58 A whilst the equatorial P—F lengths are
1.53 A. in contrast nmr studies suggest that all five F atoms are equivalent.
This paradox may.be explained quite simply. Electron diffraction gives
an instantaneous picture of the molecule, whilst nmr gives the picture
averaged over several milliseconds. The axial and equatorial F atoms are
thought to interchange their positions in less time than that needed to
take the nmr. The interchange of axial and equatorial positions is called
pseudorotation’.

PFs remains covalent and keeps this structure in the solid state.
