However, PCle s close to the 1onte-covalent borderline, and its covalent
inthe gas and liquid states but is omen the sohd state: PC solid exstsas
{PCLJ* and (PCLJ” the tons have tetrahedral and octahedral structures
respectively In the solid, PBrs exists as (PBr.]*Br™, and Pls appears to
be [Pla]? and I” solution

PCle is the most important pentahalide, and st 1s made by passing Cy
into a solution of PCh in CCl, World production 1s about 20000 tonnes!
year Complete hydrolysts of the pentahalides yields the appropnate 1c
ged Thus PCI, reacts wolently with water

PCl. + 44,0 HxPOs + SHC

It equimotar amounts are used, the reaction 1s more gentle and yelds
phosphorus oxochloride POC!

PCl + HO ~ POCI; + 2HCI
PCls 1s used an orgamc chemistry to convert carboxyl acids to acd
chlorides, and alcohols to alkyt halides
PC; + 4RCOOH — 4RCOC) + HPO, + HCL
PCs + 4ROH — 4RCI + H;PO, + HCL

It reacts with P,Ojo, forming POCI, and with SOz, forming thionyl
chloride SOCh,

  

GPCI. + PhOxq > 10POCI,
POIs + $0, POCk + SOCh,

PCI, also reacts wih NHCI, forming a varety of phosphonititceblonde
polymers (see tater)

PCIe + nNHCl—> (NPC), + SnHICI (ning compounds n = 3-6)
and CLP (NPCI;), NPCl, (chain compounds)

Despite the exstence of pentahalides, no hydndes MH ate known To
attain the five-valent state, d orbwtals must be used Hydrogen 1 not
suffrently electronegative 10 make the d orbitals contract sufficient,
though PHE, and PHF; have been wsolated
