‘was also important inthe obsolete Birkeland—Eyde process which involved
sparking dinitrogen and doxygen NO 1s prepared sn the laboratory by the
reduction of dilute HNOs with Cu, or reduction of HNO with I

3Cu + 8HNO,— 2NO + 3Cu(NOy)s + 44,0

NO 1s a neutral oxide and 1s not an acid anhydride

NO has 11 valency electrons It is impossible for them all to be paired
and hence this an odd electron molecule and the gas1s paramagnetic 105
‘duamagnetic in the liquid and solid states, because the molecule dimerizes
forraing O—N—N—O The asymmetrical dimer O—N—O—N has beet

acts

‘The bond length N—O 1s 125A, which 1s intermediate between @
double and a trple bond Bonding 35 best deserbed using the moleculér
‘orbital theory (see Chapter 4) ‘The bonding is sumslar to that m Nz and CO
which both have 10 outer electrons NO has 11 outer electrons, and the
extra unpamred electron occupies an antibonding x*2p orbital This reduces
the bond order from 31n No to 24 in NO If this electron 1s removed by
‘oxidizing NO. the mitrosonium ion NO* is formed In NO* the bond ord?
1s 3, and the N—O bond length contracts from 115A in NO to 106A

Odd electron molecules are usually highly reactive and tend to dimente
NO 1s unusually stable for an odd electron molecule Nevertheless
reacts instantly with dioxygen to give NO, and wath the halogens goes

NO readily forms coordination complexes with transition metal rons
“These complexes are calied nuttosyts Fe’ and NO form the complet
[Fe(H,0).NOP*, which 1s responsible for the colour m the “brown nn
test'for nitrates Most ntroxslcomplexesare coloured Another examples
sodium nitroprusside Nes{Fe(CN);NO} 2H;0 NO often acts asa three
electron donor, im contrast to most ligands which donate two electrons
‘Thus three CO groups may be replaced by two NO groups.

[Fe(CO)¢] + 2NO — [Fe(CO)s(NO)s] + 3CO

In these complexes the M—N—O atoms are linear, oF close 10 lineat
However, in 1968 the M—N—O angle in [Ie(CO)(CI)(PPhy)(NO}}* W3*
found to be 123°, and since then a number of other compleves have bee?
found with bond angles in the range 120-130" These bent bonds whe?
are weaker than straight bonds, are of considerable theoretical stetest
NO may also act as a bridgung ligand between two or three metal atomssn?
