- 20h.

Nitrogen sesquioxide N2.O;
N;O, can only be obtained at low temperatures. It can be made by
condensing equimolar amounts of NO and NOp together, or by reacting
NO with the appropriate amount of O>. This gives a blue liquid or solid,
which is unstable and dissociates into NO and NO) at —30°C.
NO + NO, N20,
4NO + O2 > 2N;0,;
Iris an acidic oxide and is the anhydride of nitrous acid HNO>. With alkali
it forms nitrites.
N20, + H,0 — 2HNO;
N20, + NaOH — 2NaNO, + H20
N2O, reacts with the concentrated acids, forming nitrosyl salts:
N20, + 2HCIO, > 2NO[CIO,4} + H,0
N20, + 2H,SO, > 2NO[{HSO,] + HO
The oxide exists in two different forms. These may be interconverted by
irradiation with light of the appropriate wavelength. The N—N bond
length from microwave spectra is 1.864 A in the asymmetrical form. This is

exceptionally long and thus the bond is exceptionally weak compared with
the N--N bond found in hydrazine (length of 1 45 A).

Nitrogen dioxide NO> and dinitrogen tetroxide N20,

NO) ts a red-brown poisonous gas and 1s produced on a large scale by
oxidizing NO in the Ostwald process for the manufacture of mitric acid. In
the laboratory 1 is prepared by heaung lead mtrate:

2Pb(NO4)2 — 2PbO + 4INOz + O2

The gascous products Oy and NO» are passed through a U-tube cooled in
we, The NO2 (b.p. 21°C) condenses. The Pb(NO)2 must be carefully
dried. since NO} reacts with water, The NO) is obtained as a brown liquid
inch turns paler on cooling, and eventually becomes a colourless solid.
This iy because NO: dimerizes into colourless NxOy. NO is an odd
electron molecule, and is paramagnetic and very reactive. It dimenizes to
N20,. pairing the Previously unpaired electrons. N.O, has no unpaired
electrons and is diamagnetic.
