| OXOACIDS OF NITROGEN
Dinitrogen pentoxide N,Os

NOs is prepared by carefully dehydrating HNO; with P05 at low
temperatures. It is a colourless deliquescent solid, which is highly reactive,
is a strong oxidizing agent, and is light sensitive. It is the anhydride of
HNO3.

N2Os + H,O > 2HNO3

N,O; + Na—> NaNO; + NO
N20, + NaCl > NaNO; + NO,CI
NOs + 3H,SO, > H30* + 2NOF + 3HSOZ
In the gas phase N20; decomposes into NO2, NO and Op. Nitrogen
trioxide NO; may be formed by treating NOs with O03.
X-ray diffraction shows that solid N2Os is ionic NO} NO5: it should in

reality be called nitronium nitrate. It is covalent in solution and in the gas
phase, and probably has the structure:

OXOACIDS OF NITROGEN

Nitrous acid HNO2

Nitrous acid is unstable except in dilute solution. It is easily made by
acidifying a solution of a nitrite. Barium nitrite is often used with H2SO.,
since the insoluble BaSO, can be filtered off easily.

Ba(NO,). + H,SO, > 2HNO2 + BaSO,

Group 1 metal nitrites can be made by heating nitrates, either on their
own or with Pb.

Nitrous acid and nitrites are weak oxidizing agents and will oxidize Fe2* to
re’”,and I~ to I>: they themselves are reduced to N2O or NO. However,
HNO) and nitrites are oxidized by KMnO, and Cl, forming nitrates NOJ.
Large amounts of nitrites are used to make diazo compounds, which are
Converted into azo dyes, and also pharmaceutical products.
