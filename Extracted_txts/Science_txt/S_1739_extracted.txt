The shape of the NO} ion is a planar triangle, like the C03" ion. The
later elements in both groups form tetrahedral oxoacid ions such as PO?"
and SiO3~. This difference in shape is probably due to the small size of the
Nand C atoms and their restriction to eight electrons in their outer shell.

HNO; is an excellent oxidizing agent particularly when hot and concen-
trated. H* ions are oxidizing, but the NO3 ion is an even stronger
oxidizing agent in acid solution. Thus metals like copper and silver which
are insoluble ir HCI dissolve in HNO3. Some metals such as gold are
insoluble even in HNOs, but will dissolve in aqua regia, a mixture of 25%
concentrated HNO; and 75% concentrated HCl. The enhanced ability to
dissolve metals shown by aqua regia arises from the oxidizing power of
HNO, coupled with the ability of CI” to form complexes with the metal
ions.

HNO; was originally made from NaNO; or KNO, and concentrated
H,SOs. The first synthetic method was the Birkeland-Eyde process. This
sparked N, and O; together in an electric arc furnace, and passed the gas
into water. The process was started in Norway in 1903, but is now obsolete,
because of the high ‘cost of electricity.

The Ostwald process depends on the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to
NO, followed by oxidation of NO to NO,, and conversion of NO with
water to HNO3. The first plant was set up in Germany in 1908, and
Ostwald was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. The method is still used and

about 24.7 million tonnes/year of HNO3 are produced. The overall process
is:

The NO and air are cooled and the mixture of gases is absorbed in a
countercurrent of water.

This gives a HNO; solution of concentration 60% by weight. Distillation
only increases the concentration to 68% since a constant boiling mixture is
formed, ‘Concentrated’ HNOs contains 98% acid and is produced by de-
hydrating with concentrated sulphuric acid, or by mixing with a 72%
magnesium nitrate solution, followed by distillation.

When nitric acid is mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid. the nitron-

tum ion NOZ is formed. This is the active species in the nitration of
