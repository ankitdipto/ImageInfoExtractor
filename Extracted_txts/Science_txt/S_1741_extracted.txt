atoms are equivalent, In addition to the o bonds, four-centre x molecular
orbitals cover the N and the three O atoms. Each of the N—O bonds has a
bond order of 14, 1 from the o bond and 4 from the bond. (This is des-
cribed more fully in Chapter 4. under ‘Examples of molecular orbital
treatment involving delocalised = bonding’.)

Reduction of nitrates in acid solution gives either NO or NO, but in

alkaline solutions with metals such as Devarda’s alloy (Cu/Al/Zn),
ammonia is produced.
