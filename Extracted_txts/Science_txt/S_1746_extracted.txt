‘Three sens of salts can be formed

1 Dihydrogen phosphates, for example sodium dihydrogen phosphate
NaH;PO«, which is slightly acidic 1 water

2 Monohydrogen phosphates, for example disodium hydrogen phos
phate NazHPO«, which is slightly baste m water

3. Notmal phosphates such as tnsodium phosphate NaxPO., which ste
appreciably basic in solution

NaHi,PO, and NagHPO, are made industnally by neutralizing HyPO, with
‘soda ash? (Na;CO,), but NaOH 1s required to make NasPO, All three
salts exst m the anhydrous state and also in a number of hydrated for
and they are used extensively

Phosphoric aed also forms esters with alcohols

Phosphates are detected analytically by mixing a solution ofthe sat wih
dilute HNO} and ammontum molybdate solution A yellow precipitate of
1 complex ammonrum 12-molybdophosphate forms slowly, confirming tt
presence of phosphates Arsenates form a similar precipitate, but only ot
heating the muxture

‘The orthophosphates of Group 1 metals (except Lt) and NHf are solate
