Impure orthophosphoric acid H3PO, is prepared in large amounts by
treating phosphate rock with ’H,SOy. This is called the ‘wet process’. The
CaSO, is hydrated to gypsum CaSO, -2H20, which is filtered off, and the
F~ is converted to Na2[SiFs] and removed. The H3PO, is concentrated
by evaporation. Most of the H3PO, made in this way is used to make
fertilizer.

Ca3(PO4)2 + 3H2SO4 > 2H3PO, + 3CaSO,
[3(Ca3(PO,)2) - CaF] + 10H2SO, — 6H3PO. + 10CaSO, + 2HF

Pure H3PO, is made by the ‘furnace process’. Molten P is burnt in a
furnace with air and steam. First P,O,9 is formed by reaction between P
and O, and then this is immediately hydrolysed.

Py + 502 > P4010
P4Qi9 + 6H2O — 4H3PO,4

Phosphoric acid is hydrogen bonded in aqueous solution, and because of
this the ‘concentrated acid’ is syrupy and viscous. Concentrated acid is
widely used and contains about 85% by weight of H3PO, (100% pure
(anhydrous) H3PO, is seldom used, but it can be prepared as colourless
deliquescent crystals by evaporation at low pressure). Most of the acid
(solution) made in this way is used in the laboratory, and in food (Kraft
cheese NagHPO,) and pharmaceutical preparations.
H3PO, may also be made by the action of concentrated HNO; on P.

Polyphosphates

A very large number of polyphosphoric acids and their salts, the
Polyphosphates, arise by polymerizing acidic [PO,] units forming isopoly-
acids. These consist of chains of tetrahedra, each sharing the O atoms at
one or two corners of the [PO,] tetrahedron, giving simple unbranched
chains, in a similar way to the formation of pyroxenes by the silicates.
The hydrolysis of P,Ojo proceeds in stages, and an understanding of

these Stages leads to an understanding of the wide range of phosphoric
acids (Figure 14.14),

\ Pe olyphosphates are straight chain compounds. The basicity of the
be den acids, that is the number of replaceable H atoms, can be found
¥ Crawing the structure and counting the number of OH groups. Thus
