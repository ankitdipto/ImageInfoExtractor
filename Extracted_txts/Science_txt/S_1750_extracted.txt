Long chain polyphosphates —hnear metaphosphates

‘The very long chain polyphosphates have caused confusion im the pst
since they were orginally called metaphosphates a name used for neg
compounds When the number of units in the polymer 1 becomes ser)
lasge, the formuls of a chan polyphosphate (POx), POs becomes
ndistingushable from that of a true metaphosphate, that 1s a ng
compound with a formula (POs)y, The long chains ate sometimes calles
linear metaphosphates

phosphates and a lute cross linked material (Molecular weight ofthese
long chain polymenie species can be determined by titrating the tnd
