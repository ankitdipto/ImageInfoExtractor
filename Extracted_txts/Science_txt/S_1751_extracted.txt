similar to the asbestos minerals in the silicates, some of which are made of
chains, and others of sheets. Annealing one form of Kurrol salt at 400°C
gives sodium trimetaphosphate, and the other gives Maddrell’s high tem-
Perature salt. All forms of sodium polyphosphate revert to (cyclic) sodium
trimetaphosphate near the melting point 625°C, or on annealing (pro-
longed heating) at 400°C. This is presumably because the trimetaphos-
phate has the most stable crystal structure.

Metaphosphates — cyclophosphates

The metaphosphates form a family of ring compounds. The old name
of metaphosphates is still widely used even though according to IUPAC
Nomenclature cyclo- should be used to indicate the formation of rings.
They can be prepared by heating orthophosphates:
