red phosphorus by NaOCl, or yellow phosphorus by water and air. There
are no P—H bonds, and so this acid is not a reducing agent. There are four
acidic hydrogens, and hence the acid is tetrabasic and can form four series
of salts, though usually two hydrogens are replaced, It is unusual in that it
contains a P—P bond. This is much stronger than the P—O—P bond, so
hydrolysis is slow.

THE PHOSPHOROUS ACID SERIES

The phosphorous acids are less well known. They all contain phosphorus in
the oxidation state (+III). They have P—H bonds and are therefore
reducing agents. .

Hydrolysis of PsO, in a manner, analogous to the hydrolysis of PsO19
already described yields pyro- and orthophosphorous acids, which are both
dibasic and reducing agents.

Orthophosphorous acid H3PO3

HsPO3 contains two acidic H atoms (the OH groups), and one reducing H

(the P—H hydrogen atom). Consequently only two of the three H atoms
can ionize, and the acid is dibasic.

H3PO3 = H* + H,POz Ky
H2PO3 = H* + HPO} Ky
Thus H3PO; can form two series of salts:

1 Dihydrogen phosphites; for example NaH2PO3.
2. Monohydrogen phosphites, for example Na,HPO3.

7x 1077

The phosphites are very strong reducing agents in basic solutions. In acid

solutions they are converted to H3PO3, which is still a moderately strong
teducing agent.
