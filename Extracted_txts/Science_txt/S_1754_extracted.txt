MAJOR USES OF PHOSPHATES

Phosphate rock 1s mined on a vast scale (145 mullion tonnes in 1992) The
munerals vary both in purity and un composition, lndustey expresses the
production of phosphates in terms of the P,Os content On this bass
World production of phosphates ts about 34 milkon tonnes pet year (TRS
ze equtvalent to 465 malin tonnes of HyPO, ) The mayor comme
tses ate as follows

85% For fertitzers such as superphosphate taple superphosphate 28d
ammonium phosphate ‘These do not need ta be especally pure

5% Added to detergents (builders ve fillers) manly sodium 1
polyphosphate im powders and sodium pyrophosphate in had
