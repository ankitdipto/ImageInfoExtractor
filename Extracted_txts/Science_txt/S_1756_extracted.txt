Figure 14 19 Structures of phosphorus sulphides

reactants present Two more compounds P,S, and P,Sp have been made
using other reactions

PSio 18 structurally the seme as P4Oyo, but the absence of P.S,
surprising. The structures of the other sulphides have no counterparts 2
the oxides They are loosely related to the structures of the oxides PQs
and P4O\o with a tetrahedron of P atoms, with some S atoms bndges,
between P atoms and others occupying apical posttions attached fo F
atoms

PSs

Phosphorus insulphide PS) 15 the most stable sulphide It ts made by
heating red phosphorus and a hmited amount of sulphur to 180°C 10 2
inert atmosphere It % soluble in orgamic solvents such as toluene aad
carbon disulphide traces of unreacted P can be removed enher by
‘erystalization from toluene or by distillation 4S; 1s used commestsally for
‘making matches Matches contain P,S3, KCIOs, fillers and glue The
friction between the match and the sandpaper on the side of the bot
‘mitiates 2 violent reacton between the PS, and KCIO, This generates
‘enough heat to make the match burst into flame
