Sjo is the most important sulphide. It is made by reacting liq whit
phosphorus at 300°C with a slight excess of sulphur. World production is
about 250000 tonnes/year. It hydrolyses in water, forming phosphoric acid
ina similar way to PaO.

P,Sip + 16H,O —> 4H3PO, + 10H2S

The most important reaction of P4Sio is hydrolysis by alcohols and phenols
to give dialkyl or diary! dithiophosphoric acids.

The Zn salts of dialkyl and diaryl thiophosphates ((RO)2- P - (S)}2Zn are
used as extreme pressure additives in high pressure lubricants such as
gearbox oil. (EtO),-P-(S)-Na and (EtO),-P-(S)-NH, are used as
flotation agents for concentrating sulphide ores such as PbS and ZnS
before smelting. The methyl and ethyl derivatives are used in the manu-
facture of pesticides such as malathion and parathion.

These organophosphorus esters are very effective insecticides. They
hia the nervous system of insects from working properly, thus killing
the insects very rapidly. Acetylcholine is a chemical neurotransmitter,
Produced to transmit nerve impulses across a synaptic junction. Normally
