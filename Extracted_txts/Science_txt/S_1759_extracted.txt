called phosphonitrilic halides, but are now named systematically

poly(chlorophosphazenes).

Figure 14.22 Some polyphosphazene chain compounds.

The chlorine atoms are reactive, and most reactions of chlorophos-
phazenes involve replacement of Cl by groups such as alkyl, aryl, OH, OR,
NCS or NR. Alkyl or aryl groups may be introduced using lithium or
Grignard reagents. Substitution may be complete, or partial, and in the
latter case many different isomers are possible.

Similar compounds are formed with Br and F. The largest rings formed
contain 34 atoms in the chlorides and 12 atoms in the bromides. Some of
the long chain polymers are rubber-like, and those with perfluoroalkoxy
side groups [NP(OCH,CF3)2],, resemble polythene.

There are many potential uses for the high molecular weight phos-
phazenes, as rigid plastics, expanded foam, and fibres, since they are
Waterproof and fireproof, and are unaffected by petrol, oil, and solvents.
They also form flexible plastics which are useful for fuel hoses and gaskets
Since they retain their elasticity at low temperatures. The phosphazenes are
at present far too expensive for general use. Thin films of poly(aminopho-
sphazene) are used in hospitals to cover severe burns and other extensive
wounds since they prevent the loss of body fluids and keep germs out.

There are two main points of interest in these P—N compounds:

1. The nature of the bonding is not understood. In all of these phos-
phazene compounds the (apparent) P—N and P==N bonds are equi-
valent. Their bond lengths are 1.56~1.59 A, which is much shorter than
the usual single bond distance of 1.77 A. Thus the bonding in these
compounds is not adequately represented by a system of alternate single
