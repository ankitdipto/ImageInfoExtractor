9.3 Catabolism of proteins and fats can yield considerable energy.

Glucose Is Not the Only
Source of Energy

Thus far we have discussed oxidative
respiration of glucose, which organisms
obtain from the digestion of carbohy-
drates or from photosynthesis. Other
organic molecules than glucose, partic-
ularly proteins and fats, are also impor-
tant sources of energy (figure 9.21).

Cellular Respiration of Protein

Proteins are first broken down into their
individual amino acids. The nitrogen-
containing side group (the amino
group) is then removed from each
amino acid in a process called deamina-
tion. A series of reactions convert the
carbon chain that remains into a mole-
cule that takes part in glycolysis or the
Krebs cycle. For example, alanine is
converted into pyruvate, glutamate into
o-ketoglutarate (figure 9.22), and aspar-
tate into oxaloacetate. The reactions of
glycolysis and the Krebs cycle then ex-
tract the high-energy electrons from
these molecules and put them to work
making ATP.

FIGURE 9.22
Deamination. After
proteins are broken down
into their amino acid
constituents, the amino
groups are removed from
the amino acids to form
molecules that participate in
glycolysis and the Krebs
cycle. For example, the
amino acid glutamate
becomes a-ketoglutarate, a
Krebs cycle molecule, when
it loses its amino group.

How cells extract chemical energy. All eukaryotes and many prokaryotes extract energy
from organic molecules by oxidizing them. The first stage of this process, breaking down
macromolecules into their constituent parts, yields little energy. The second stage,
oxidative or aerobic respiration, extracts energy, primarily in the form of high-energy
electrons, and produces water and carbon dioxide.
