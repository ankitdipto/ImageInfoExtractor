‘What are the main ingredients in fertdizers? How are twey made and
what use do the plants make of them?

Compare the oxides of nitrogen and phosphorus

Substance (A) 1s a gas of vapour densty 85 On oxidation at high
Temperature with a platinum catalyst t gave a colourless gas (B),
‘which rapidly turned brown nar, forming a gas (C) (B) and (C) were
condensed together to give substance (D), which reacted with water,
forming an acxd (E) On treatment of (E) with an acidified solution of
Xl, g2s (B) was evolved, but when (E) was treated witha solution of
NHLCI, a stable colourless gas (F) was evolved (F) did not support
combustion, but magnesium contioued to burn in it However, (F)
reacted with calewm carbide in an electne furnace, forming a sok
