GROUP 16 THE CHALCOGENS 4

 

‘The elements also form compounds containing two covalent (electton
parr) bonds such as HO, FO, Cl,0, HsS and SCI, Where the chalcogen
‘atom is the least electronegateve atom im the motecule (eg in SCl; where
the electroneganwiy of S = 25 and Cl = 35) the S shows an oxidation,
state of (+11)

In addition, the elements S, Se and Te show oxidation states of IV and
‘Vi, and these are more stable than the +11 state

 

ABUNDANCE OF THE ELEMENTS.

‘Oxygen 1s the most abundant ofall elements It exists 1m the free form 3s
ioxygen molecules O; and makes up 20 9% by volume and 23% by weight
of the atmosphere Most of this has been produced by photosyathesss
the process where the chlorophyll in the green parts of plants uses the
sun's energy to mae foodstuffs such as glucose sugar

600, + 64,0 + energy from the sun + CsHisOs + 60s

Oxygen makes up 46 6% by weaght of the earth's crust, where 1s the
major constituent of silicate minerals Oxygen also occurs as many metal
‘onide ores, and as deposits of oxosalts such as earbonates. sulphates ni
trates and borates Oceans cover three quarters of the earth's surface
and oxygen makes up 89% by weight of the water in the oceans. Ozone
(y exists in the upper atmosphere, and 1s of great importance This 1s
discussed later

Sulphur 1s the sixteenth most abundant element and constitutes 0 034%
by weight of the earth’s crust It occurs macaly 1m the combmed form as
rurmerous sulphide ores and as sulphates (particularly gypsum CaSOy
2H,0) Its not economic fo mine these to obtain S, although gypsum is
mined for other uses ‘The native element can be obtamed from volcanic
‘sourcesin many places, but these sources are litle used now except n Japan
and Menico From Biblical times up tll the present century volcanic sources
provided the mayor source of S In early times S 1n the form of brimstone
(burning rock) was used for furngation From the thirteenth ceatury unt
the middle of the nineteenth century 1t was used to make gunpowder In
the present century the major use has been to make H;SOs

‘The other elements Se Te and Po are very scarce
