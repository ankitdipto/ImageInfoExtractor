GROUP 16 THE CHALCOGENS

1 The conversion to steel 1s quicker

2. Larger ingots of pig iron can be used (Bessemer 6 tonnes, BOP 100
tonnes)

3. The metal does not form minides, which ean occur when air 1 used

In some places doxygen 1s introduced with ate into blast furnaces used
for the reduction of iron oxides to impure pig iron by coke The reason
for using dioxygen 1s largely to allow the use of some heavy hydrocasbors
(naptha) as fuels 2s a partial replacement for expensive metallurgical coke
Diowygen 1s also used for oxy-acetylene welding and metal cutting. Other
important chemical uses of dhoxygen include the following

   

 

1 The preparation of T:O; from TiCl, TiO» 1s used as a white pigment in
paint and paper and as a filler n plastics

2 Ta oxulize Ney im the manufacture of HNOs

4 Im the manufacture of oxirane (ethylene oxide) from ethene

4 As the oxidant m rockets

Extraction of sulphur

World production of $ was 57 mutton tonnes in 1992 The main producess
are the USA 20%, the former Soviet Union 15%, Canada 13%, Child
12% and Japan and the former Czechostovakia 5% each There af&
several methods of extracting $

Recovered from natural gas and petroleum 48%

Mined by the Frasch process 9%
From pynites 17%
Recovered from smelter gases 12%
‘Mined as sulphur ore 4%
Made from CaSO, 003%

Lasge amounts of sulphur are obtained from natural gas plants 0
Canada these plants are the mayor source (90%) of S since the natura} pS
there may contain up to 20% HaS Ita essential that all traces of sulphur
compounds are removed from natural gas, since HyS has an objectionable
smell Furthermore, burning sulphur compounds forms SO, which has
‘an acrid smell and 1s cortoswe Tn a sumvlar way, large amounts ofS af
‘obtained from oi refineries (60% of the USA total and 37% of the USSR
total) After cracking long chain hydrocarbons, Hz and other sulphi
denvatives are removed because of thetr objecuonable smell About @
turd of the HS 1s oxideed an aur to gave SOz, which i subsequenty 2
acted with the remaining HS. This provides a second major source of S
anthe USA and Japan ‘With the enormous inrease mn the use of nateral
gas und oil, more S vs now obtained from gas and pettoleum than 1s muned
by the Fraich process (see later)

‘Mayor deposits of native § are found im the USA (the Gulf of Mexico
States Louisiana, Texas. and Mexico), and inthe upper Vistula region of
Poland and the Ukrame These deposits of § were formed by anaerob'©
bacteria which metabolize CaSO, t0 form HS and S
