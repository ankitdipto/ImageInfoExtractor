Atone time elemental § was obtained in large amounts as a by-product it

the production of coal gas Since natural gas has replaced coal gas (tox
gas) m many developed areas, this source has largely disappeared except
in less developed areas

 

Acid rain and SO,

Coal typically contains 2% S, and may contain up 10.4% Thus represents
1 huge potential source of S, which could be extracted as $0, from the
flue gases Worldwide about 4530 mullion tonnes of coal were produced
1m 1992 The largest use ts in coal burning electricity generating plants
Worldwide this produces about 90 milion tonnes of S, that 1s 180 rata
tonnes of SO, (In the UK 85 malion tonnes of coa! are used an power
stations producing about 2.4 milion tonnes per year of $ or 48 min
tonnes of SO, } Because i 5 uneconomic to remove the SO, only about
1% of tis total tonnage ts recovered as HS, The majority Isdischarged
into the atmosphere where it causes acid rain

‘The atmospheric chemistry of acid rain 1s not fully understood SO, 18
‘oxidized by ozone or hydrogen peroxide to SOx This reacts with water ot
hydroxyl radicals to give HS, Ammonium sulphate 1s also formed, and
‘ean be seen as an atmospheric haze (sometimes desenibed as an aerosol of
fine particles) Wer deposiuon occurs after ramdrops become nucleated
‘with aerosol particles of $03 or (NH,)2SO,, but SO; des not dissolve 19
significant amounts Instead SOz 1 deposited by dry depastnon and 18
absorbed directly on both sohd and tiquid ground surfaces. In 1982 UK
deposition was about 50 units (kg hectare"! year™!) of dry and $ unis
fof wet The name ‘acid rain’ ss misleading since st refers to both wet and
dry deposition

Inevitably power stations are located (and SO; 1s emutted) mn denselY
Populated regions Using high chimney stacks to disperse the gxs merelY
moves the problem on to someone else For example, 10% of SO poll’
tion in Sweden actually comes from Sweden, but 80% comes from the
industrial regions of Europe (East and West Germany, Poland, Czecho
slovakia) and 10% from Britain Acid rain causes damage to trees, plant
fish and bunldings, and causes respiratory ailments 1n man and anials
About 60% of atmospheric SOs comes from coal fred power stations
Most of the rest comes from oil refineries, uf fired power stations and
smelters

“Total elimination of SO, pollution 1s not possible for both economic and
technical reasons However, we have the technology to reduce pollution 10
alow figure The methods used are scrubbing the flue gases witha slurry of
‘Ca(OH);, oF reducing the SO; t0 § using H,S and an activated alumina
catalyst
