World production of Te metal was 152 tonnes in 1992 The mayor part
of this 1s used in making steel and non ferrous alloys for example to
hrarden lead

Both Se and Te compounds are absorbed by the human body and are
excreted as foul smelling orgamie derwatiwes un breath and sweat

Discovery and production of polonium

Potonium was discovered by Marte Cust by processing very large amounts
fof thorium and uranium minerals and separating the decay products
Polomum is one of the decay products (see Radioactive decay senes in
‘Chapter 31) The separation was observed by studying the radiozctty
