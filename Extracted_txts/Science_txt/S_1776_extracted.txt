from the erystal structures adopted The two common ctystalhine forms
are @ oF thombie sulphur which 1s stable at room temperature, and Bor
‘monoclinic sulphur which is stable above 95 5°C. These two forms change
reversibly wth slow heating or slow cooling Rhombic sulphur occurs
naturally as large yellow crystals in voleamic areas A thitd modification
‘known as 7 monochnie sulphur 16 nacreous (100ks Like mother of peat!)

It-can be made by chilling hot concentrated solutions of S in solvents such
‘a8 CS;, toluene or EtOH All three forms contain puckered Sy ngs with
‘crown conformation (Figure 15 2), and differ only in the overall packing

Engel s sulphur (¢ sulphur) 1s unstable and contains S, rings arranged
1 the chair conformation It 1s made by pouring NagS,Os solution into
concentrated HC) and extracting the $ wath toluene It can also be made
as follows

 

HySq + SiC $5 + 2HCL

Several other rings S;, So, Sio. S11, Sy2, Syq And So have been made by
‘Schmidt and his group They are usually obtained by 1 1 reactions in dry
ether between hydrogen polysulphdes and polysulphur dichlondes with
the required number of atoms, for example

HS, + 8,Clr > Sig + 2HO.
HSq + SiCly + Siz + 2HCL

In al ofthese ring compounds the S—S distance is 2 04-2 .06A and the
‘bond angle S—S—S 1s tn the range 102-108" They are all soluble 19 CS

Plastic or x sulphur 1s obtamed by pouring liquid sulphar into water
Several other forms can be produced by quenching molten S These may
bbe fibrous laminar or rubber like, and a commercial form 3s called Cry
stex These are all metastable and revert tothe @ (cyclo Sq) form on stand
‘ing. Their structures contain spiral chains, and sometimes Sq and other
rings

‘Sulphur melts to form a mobile quid As the temperature 1s raised the
‘colour darkens At 160°C the Sy rings break, and the diradicals so formed
polymenze, forming long chains of up to a mailion atoms ‘This makes all
the physical properties change discontinuously ‘The viscosity mereases
sharply, and continues to nse up t0 200°C At higher temperatures chairs
break, and shorter chains and rings are formed, whuch makes the viscosty

‘mostly of Ss rings, but contains 1-2% of Sy molecules. At 600°C the B35
