sumably has similar bonding. S2 gas is stable up to 2200°C. The stability
of S, is used in the quantitative analysis of S compounds. They are burnt
in a reducing flame, and the colour from excited S, is measured spectro-
photometrically. S; and S, are also known.

Selenium, tellurium and polonium

Six allotropes of selenium are known. Interest in these is because Se is
used in electronic devices. These include capturing the image in Xerox-
type photocopiers, as rectifiers (to convert alternating current into direct
current), and as light emitting diodes (LEDs). There are four red forms.
Three different red non-metallic forms are known containing Seg rings.
They differ in the way the rings are packed in the crystal. An ‘amorphous’
red form contains polymeric chains. There are in addition two grey forms.
The most stable is the grey metallic form, which contains infinite spiral
chains of Se atoms with weak metallic interaction between adjacent chains.
A black vitreous form of Se is commercially available, and is made of large
irregular rings with up to 1000 atoms.

Tellurium has only one crystalline form, which is silvery white and semi-
metallic. This is similar to grey Se, but has stronger metallic interaction.

Polonium is a true metal. It exists as an a-form which is cubic and a
B-form which is rhombohedral. Both forms are metallic.

Thus there is a marked decrease in the number of allotropic forms from
S to Se to Te. There is an increase in metallic character down the group.
The electrical properties also change from insulators (O and S), to semi-
conductors (Se and Te), to metallic conduction (Po). The structures change
from simple diatomic molecules, to rings and chains, to a simple metallic
lattice.

Sulphur dissolves in oleum, giving brightly coloured solutions, which
may be yellow, deep blue. or bright red. These contain cations [S,]**.
(SaP* is bright yellow, and the X-ray structuré shows it is square planar.
It is isoelectronic with S,N2. [Sg]°* is deep blue and the structure is cyclic.
The red colour was thought to be due to [Sis]?*, but has recently been
shown to be due to [S,9]**. Selenium and tellurium also dissolve in

fre ut forming [Se4]**, [Tes]**, [Seg]** and, in addition, [Seyo]** and
ex|**.

CHEMISTRY OF OZONE

Os is an unstable, dark blue diamagnetic gas, b.p. —112°C. The colour is
due to intense absorption of red light (A 557 and 602nm). It also absorbs
Strongly in the UV region (A 255nm). This is particularly important since
there isa layer of O3 in the upper atmosphere which absorbs harmful UV
radiation from the sun, thus protecting people on the earth. The use of
chlorofluorocarbons in aerosols and refrigerators, and their subsequent
escape into the atmosphere, is blamed for making holes in the ozone layer
over the Antarctic and Arctic. It is feared that this will allow an excess-
