halogens can also damage the Os layer (See Chapter 13 )

‘Oshas a characteristic sharp smell, often associated with sparking elect

of 01 ppm must be avoided

(04 ts usually prepared by the action ofa silent electnc discharge upon
dioxygen between two concentric metalized tubes in an apparatus called
an ozonizer Concentrations of up to 10% of Oy are obtained un this way
Higher concentrations or pure Os can be obtained by fractional lquie-
tion of the mixture The pure liquid ss dangerously exploswe Low con-
centrations of Oy can be made by UV artadiation of Oz This occurs in the
atmosphere when photochemical smog 1s formed over some cites, for
example over Los Angeles or Tokyo The photochemical change 1s useful
for producing low concentrations to stenlize food, particularly for cold
storage 03 can also be made by heating O; to over 2500°C and quench-
1ng_In all of these preparations oxygen atoms are produced, and these
react with Oz molecules to form Oy
