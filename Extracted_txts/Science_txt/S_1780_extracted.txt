TeO} have sl much greater oxdraing power than SO} The differences
between the oxdizing power of the (+1V) states of polonite, telluite,
selenite and sulphute are smaller ‘The potentiats also show the decrease in
stability from HO to H3S to H3Se to H3Te to HzPo the last three are
thermodynamucally unstable ‘

 

OXIDATION STATES (+11), (HIV) AND (+VI)

Oxygen 1s never more than divalent because when st has formed two co-
valent bondy has attained a noble gas configuranion, and there are no
ow energy orbrtals which can be used to form futher bonds However,
the elements S, Se, Te and Po have empty orbitals which may be used for
bonding, and they can form four or six bonds by unpairing electrons

BOND LENGTHS AND pr—dx BONDING

‘The bonds between $ and O, of Se and O, are much shorter than might
be expected for a single bond In some cases the mas be formulated 3s
localized double bonds A ¢ bond 1s formed in the usual wat In addition
a x bond 1s formed by the sidewavs overlap of a p orbuull on the oxygen
