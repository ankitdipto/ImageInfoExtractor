Peromdes

“These contain more oxygen than would be expected from the oxtaton
number of M_ Some are tonic and contain the peroxide 10n OF", for
example those of Group 1 and 2 metals (Na,0z and BaO;) Others ae
‘covalently bound and contain —O—-O— in the structure, for example

Peroxo compounds are strong oxidizing agents, and are hydoolsed by
water to give H2O2

Superoxides, eg KO,, contain more oxygen than would be expected
(see Chapter 9)

Suboxsdes

Here the formuta contains less oxygen than would be expected from the
‘oxidation number of M_They involve M—M bonds in addition to M—O
bonds, for example O=C=C=C=O

A second method of classifying oxides depends on their acid-base po
eres ‘Thus oxides may be acidic, basic, amphotenc or neutral, depending
fon the products formed when they react with water
