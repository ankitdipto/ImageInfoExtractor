from the most basie to the most acidic, then the further apart two oxides
are 1n the senes, the more stable the compound formed when they react
together Thus can be put on a quantitative basis by considennng the changes

From the AG values, NaxO 1s the most baste and AlgQs the least baste In
fact Na,O 1s strongly basic and Als 1s amphoteric From the free energy
values for the hydroxdes, NaQH 1s ehemcally the most reactwe and
AI(OH); the most stable This 1s also true mn the following reactions

From the AG values, SOs the most strongly acidic oxide, NzOs 1 the
next strongest, and CO, 1 the weakest From the free energy values ofthe
salts formed, Ca(NOj)z 15 the least stable and the most reactive, whulst
CaSOq 1s the most stable and the least reactive

‘The order of acidic strength of oxides can be obtamned as follows

K,0, CaO, MgO, CuO, H0, $103, COs, Nz0s, S03,

Free energy data and seidie power are clearly related Thermodynamics
allows us to predict if a reaction 1s possible m terms of energy This use of
AG values 15 not limited to oxides, but applies (0 all reactions Thermo-
dynamics does not allow us to predict the rate of a reaction For example,
the reaction below 1s thermodynamically possible

at hugh temperatures in a blast furnace
