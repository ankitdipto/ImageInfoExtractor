SO, is produced commercially on a vast scale:

1, By burning S in air.

2. By burning H,S in air.

3. By roasting various metal sulphide ores with air in smelters (particularly
FeS, and to a smaller extent CuS and ZnS).

4. Large amounts are produced as a waste product by burning coal and,
to a lesser extent, other fossil fuels, oi] and gas. This undoubtedly
harms the environment.

SO, is a colourless gas (b.p. -10°C, m.p. -75.5°C), which has a chok-
ing smell, and is very soluble in water (39cm™~> of SO, gas will dissolve
in 1cm7> of water). The SO, in solution is almost completely present as
various hydrated species such as SO - 6H2O and the solution contains only
a minute amount of sulphurous acid H2SO3. SO, levels above 5 ppm are
Poisonous to man, but plants are harmed at appreciably fower levels.

SO, may be detected in the laboratory:

1. By its smell.
2. Because it turns a filter paper moistened with acidified potassium di-
chromate solution green, due to the formation of Cr>*.

K,Cr0, + 380, + H2SO4 > Cra(SO,)3 + K,SO, + H,O
3. Because it turns starch iodate paper blue (due to starch and Ty).
2KI03 + 5SO, + 4H,O > Ip + 2KHSO, + 3H2SO,
Quantitative methods for measuring SO in the atmosphere are highly

eyergped because of environmental concern over ‘acid rain’. Methods
