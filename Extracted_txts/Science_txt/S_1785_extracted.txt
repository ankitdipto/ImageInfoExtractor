2. Reaction with Ky[HgCU] to give a mercury complex which reacts wath
the dye pararosaniline, and 1s estimated colonmetrcally
K,[HgCh] + 250; + 2H,0 ~ K,{Hg(S05),] + 4HCt
3. Burning in a hydrogen flame ina flame photometer, and measunng the
spectrum of Sp (See also the discussion of singlet dioxygen )

Most of the $O2 produced 1s oxidized to SO3 by the Contact process,
and used to manufacture H,S0, Smaller amounts of SO, are used !9
make sulphites S03", for bleaching, and for preserving food and wine

‘The forward reaction 1s exothermic, and 1s favoured by a low tempert>
ture Since there 1s a decrease in the number of moles of gas, the process
1s favoured by a high pressure In practice the reaction 1s earned out at
atmosphene pressure The formation of SOs 1s favoured by an excess of
(0;, and removing the SO from the reaction mature. A catalysts used 0
obtain a reasonable conversion in a reasonable time In the Contact peo
cess.a platmum gauze and platinized asbestos were both used at one time
Pris an excellent catalyst, and it works at moderately low temperatures
However, its very expensive and 1s susceptible to porsoning, particuai!y
by metals such as As Nowadays a V2Os catalyst actated with KO
used instead, and 1s supported on kteselguhr or silica Thusis much cheapet
and i resistant to poisoning The catalyst 1s mactwve below 400°C afd
breaks down between 600°C and 650°C Dust may clog the catalyst st
face, and impair tts efficiency To prevent this the gases ate passed through
an electrostatic preciptator The catalyst may last for over 20 years Mest
‘commercial plants are four-stage convertors ‘The gases are passed ove
four beds of catalyst m turn, and are cooled in between each catalyst bed
