for a long time, or ifa trace of water is present, either f SO3 of @ SO,
formed Both look like asbestos, and comprise bundles of white siky
needles B SOs (m p 325°C) 1s made up of infinite helical chains of tetra
hedral [SO.] umits each shanng two corners This structure 1s similar to
that of chain phosphates a S03 (m p 622°C) 1s the most stable form
and ts made of chains cross inked into sheets (Figure 15 8)

‘$05 15 a powerful oxidizing agent, especrally when hot It ondrzes HBr
to Brz and Pt0 P.Oin

‘Commercially SO3 18 important 1n the manufacture of H,SO, and slso
{fot sulphonating tong chamn alkylbenzene compounds The sodium salts of
these alkylbenzene sulphonates are anionic surface active agents and are
the active ingredients of detergents

‘80, 1s used to make sulphamic acid NHjSOH

NH CO NH: + $05 + H,S0x-+ 2NILSOsH + COs

Sulphamic acid 1s the only strong acid that exsts as a sold at room tem
perature. Its used for cleaning the plant at sugar refineries and brewenes
for desalination evaporators, and for destroying any excess nitrites present
after dyeing with drazo dyestuffs

SeO5 18 formed by the action ofa silent electnc discharge on Se and O;
gases, and TeOs 1s formed from telluric acid HeTeO, by strong heating
Both tnoxides are acid anhydrides

SeOy + HO» H,SeO, seleme acid
TeO; + 3H,O > H,TeO, teller acid

 

Other oxides
‘8,0 1s formed when S and SOz are subjected t0 a silent electnc discharge
Its very reactive attacks metals and KOH, and will polymenze It can
est for a few days at low pressures It 1s of interest spectroscopically
because of us simularity m structure tay Until recently ut was wacorrectly
formulated as SO

‘A range of oxdes from S40 to $90 have been made by dissolving the
cyclo forms of Se, Sr, Ss, Sp and Syo mn CS; oF CH3Clz and oxidizing wath
tnfluoroperoxoacetic acid at ~10°C 0 ~30°C

cyclo Ss + CF;C(O—0)OH - S,0 + CF,COOH

‘These compounds are all orange~yellow in colour, and retain the original
ring of S atoms, but have an oxygen atom double bonded to one of the
ing S ators

‘TeO and PoO are obtained by thermal decomposition of a sulphite

‘TeSOs—+ TeO + SO

Detergen’s
‘Soap 1s the onginal detergent It 1s excellent for cleaning and 1s 100%
biodegradable (1 it 1s completely broken down by bactera in sewage
