OXOACIDS OF SULPHUR

‘The oxoacids of sulphur are more numerous and more tmportant than
those of Se and Te Many of the oxoacis of sulphur do not ext as fee
acids, but are known as amons and salts Acids ending in -ous have $ in
the oxidation state (#1V), and form salts ending mn site Acids ending i
“ie have $ in the oxidation state (+1V) and form salts ending in -ate

‘As discussed previously under bond lengths and pr-de bonding, the
‘oxoamions have strong x bonds and so they have hitle tendency to polym-
‘ere compared with the phosphates and sitcates. To emphasize structural
similanties the acids are hsted in four senes
