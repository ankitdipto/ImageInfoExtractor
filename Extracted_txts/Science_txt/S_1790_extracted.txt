Though SO, is very soluble in water, most is present as hydrated SO,
(SO2-H;0). Sulphurous acid H,SO3 may exist in the solution in minute
amounts, or not at all, though the solution is acidic. Its salts, the sulphites
SO", form stable crystalline solids. Many sulphites are insoluble or are
sparingly soluble in water, e.g. CaSO3, BaSO3 or Ag,SO3. However,
those of the Group 1 metals and ammonium are soluble in water, and in
-dilute solutions the hydrogen sulphite (bisulphite) ion HSO3 is the pre-
dominant species. Crystals of hydrogen sulphites have only been formed
with a few large metal ions, e.g. RbHSO; and CsHSO3. Most attempts to
isolate hydrogen sulphites lead to internal dehydration with the formation
of disulphites $027:
