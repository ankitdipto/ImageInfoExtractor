1Na,SO3 1s an important industrial chermcal, and world production
exceeds I milion tonnes/year It1s made by passing SO» into an aqueous
solution of NagCO, to give aqueous NaHSOs, then treating the solution
‘with miore Na;CO3

‘The main use of Na;SOs 1s as a bleach for wood pulp inthe paper making
industry Some 1s used to treat boiler feed water (it removes Op and thus
reduces corrosion of pipes and borlers). Small amounts are used in photo-

Sulphites and hydrogen sulphites hiberate SO, on treatment with dilute
acids"

‘NaySO3 + 2HCI—+ 2NaCI + SO; + 1,0

Sulphites and hydrogen sulphites both contain $ 1 the oxidation state
(HIV) and are moderately steong redveing agents Sulphites are deter
‘mined by reaction with Ip, and determination of the excess Ip with sodiura

‘The sulphate son exists in crystals and has a pyramidal structure, that 1s
tetrahedral with one position occupied by a fone part The bond angles
O~S—O are slightly distorted (106°) due to the lone pair, and the bond

lengths are 151A The x bond 1s delocalized, and hence the S—O bonds
have a bond order of 1 33
