 

L OXOACIDS OF SULPHUR

On oxidation sulphites form sulphates, and with sulphur they form thio-
sulphates.

Reduction of sulphite solution plus SO, with Zn dust, or electrolytically,
yields dithionites. These contain S in the oxidation state (+IIl).

sodium dithionite

The dithionite ion has an eclipsed conformation, with a very long S—S
bond (2.39A) and S—O bond lengths of 1.51A. Sodium dithionite
Na2S20, crystallizes out on adding NaCI to the mixture. The parent acid
does not exist. Na,S2O, is a powerful reducing agent, which has a variety
of industrial uses. These include bleaching paper pulp and making dye-
stuffs. It is used to treat water since it reduces many heavy metal ions
(Pb’*, Cut, Bi?*) to the metal. In NaOH solution Na,S2O, is used to
absorb dioxygen in gas analysis. It is also used to preserve foodstuffs and
fruit squashes.

Sulphuric acid series

H,SO, is the most important acid used in the chemical industry. World
production was 146 million tonnes in 1992. The main producers in millions
tonnes/year are: USA 42%, China 14%, Morocco 7% and Japan 6%. By
far the most important commercial process for its manufacture is the
Contact process, in which SO; is oxidized by air to SOs, using a catalytic
surface. Formerly a platinum gauze or platinized asbestos was used as
catalyst. This has now been replaced by vanadium pentoxide, which is
slightly less efficient but is cheaper and less easily poisoned. The SO3
could be mixed with water to give HzSO,, but the reaction is violent and
produces a dense chemical mist which is difficult to condense. Instead, the
SOs is passed into 98% H,SO,, forming pyrosulphuric acid H2S,0;,
Sometimes called oleum or fuming sulphuric acid. (Some trisulphuric acid
HS;0 19 is also formed.) This solution may be sold as oleum, or diluted
with water to give concentrated sulphuric acid which is a 98% mixture
with water (an 18M solution).

H2S.07 + H,O > 2H2SO4
H2S309 + 2H20 > 3H2SO,

(The Older lead chamber process is now obsolete. This used NO as a
fomogencous catalyst, to oxidize SO. in the presence of water. The NO
formed reacts with air to reform NO..
