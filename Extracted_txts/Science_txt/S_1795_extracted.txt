‘emulsions are made of AgNOs, AgCland AgBr Parts of the film exposed
to ight begin to decompose to Ag. thus forming @ negative image The
process is enhanced by the developer solution After developing. the fm
fr print 1s put ina solutian of hypo (Na3$,03) This forms a soluble com
plex with silver sats, thus dissolving any unchanged silver salts ut the
photographic emulsion When there 1s no photographic emulsion left
the film or print can safely be exposed to light

Most dithionates are readily soluble in water They can be isolated &

Duthionates are stable to mild oxidraing agents though strong oxidi!98
agents, such as KMnO, of the halogens oxidize them to sulphate Si!
larly, mud reducing agents have no effect but strong reducing agents reduce
<athronates to diniomtes and sulphntes
