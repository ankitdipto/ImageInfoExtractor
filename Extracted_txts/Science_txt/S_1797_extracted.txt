568 GROUP IS THECHALCOGENSSSSSSS~S~*dY

containing SeO3* and HSeO} are known The acids converted to selene
fcidby refluxing with HO; Pyroselenates containing $e:0}~ can be made
by Heating selenates, but the free acid 8 not known

H,SeO,, like H;SOs, 8 a strong acid and selenates are isomorphous

wih sulphates Both H;ScO, and H,SeOs are moderately strong oxidizing
agents

"e026 almost soluble m water so that tllurous acid has not been
characterized The dioxide does react with strong bases and forms tel
furtes, acid telluntes and various polytellurtes Tellunie acid H,TeO, 1s
quite different from sulphuric and selenre aes and exists as octahedral
‘Te(OH), molecules in the solid It1s a faly strong oxtdizing agent, but
a weak dibasic acid and forms two series of salts examples of which ace
NaTeO(OH), and LisTeO;(OH)s The acid 1s prepared by the action of
powerful oxidizing agents such as KMnO, on Te or TeO;

 

 

OXOHALIDES

‘Thionyl compounds

Only $ and Se form oxohalides These are called thionyl and selenyl
halides, and the following are known

SOF;  SOCh SOB
SeOF, Se0Cl, SeOBKy

Thionyl chloride SOCIs 1s a colourless furng hquid, bp 78°C, ands
usually prepared as follows

PCI, + $0, SOCK + POC

‘Most thionyl compounds are readily hydrolysed by water though SOF:
dnly reacts slowly,

SOCI + H,0 + SO, + 2HCL

SOCI- 1s used by organte chemists to convert carboxyhe acids to seid
chlorides and 11s also used to make anhydrous metal chlorides

SOCl + R~COOH — R—COCI + 50,

Thionvl bromide 1s prepared from the chlonde and HBr, and thionyl
Auonde 1s obtamed from the chlonde by reacung with SbF)

‘The structure of these oxohaldes 1s tetrahedral with one position 0c-
ccupied by a Jone patr

Sulphuryl compounds
‘The following sulphury! halides are known

SOF; SO;Cl,  SO.FCL_ SO.FBr
ScO,F
