~~ HYDRIDES
Sulphury! chloride $O2Cly is a colourless fuming liquid, b.p. 69°C, and
is made by direct reaction of SO, and Cl, in the presence of a catalyst. It is
used as a chlorinating agent. Sulphuryl fluoride is a gas and is not hydro-
lysed by water, but the chloride fumes in moist air and is hydrolysed by
water. The sulphuryl halides have a distorted tetrahedral structure. They
may be regarded as derivatives of H2SO,4, where both OH groups have
been replaced by halogens. If only one group is replaced, halosulphuric
acids are obtained.

FSO3H = CISO3H BrSQ3H

Fluorosulphuric acid forms many salts, but chlorosulphuric acid forms
none and is used as a chlorinating agent in organic chemistry.

HYDRIDES

The elements all form covalent hydrides. These are water HO, hydrogen
sulphide H2S, hydrogen selenide H2Se, hydrogen telluride H,Te and
hydrogen polonide H2Po. Water is liquid at room temperature, but the
others are all colourless, foul smelling toxic gases. All but H,Te can be
made from the elements. It is easier to make H2S, H2Se and H2Te by the
action of mineral acids on metal sulphides, selenides and tellurides, or
hydrolysis:

FeS + H,SO,— HS + FeSO,

FeSe + 2HCl > H,Se + FeCl,

Al,Se; + 6H,O — 3H,Se + 2AKOH);
AlTe; + 6H,0 -> 3H,Te + 2A(OH),

H,Te can also be made by electrolysing cooled dilute H2SO, with a Te
cathode. H»Po has only been obtained in trace amounts from a mixture
of Mg, Po and dilute acid.

HS. H2Se and H2Te are all soluble in water and all burn in air with a
blue flame.

2H,S + 30; -» 2H,0 + 2S0,

HS is about twice as soluble in water as CO;, and | volume of water can
absorb 4.6 volumes of 12S at 0°C and 2.6 volumes at 20°C. A saturated
solution is used as a laboratory reagent, but it does not keep well since air
slowly oxidizes it and sulphur ts deposited. H)S is a very weak dibasic acid.
Most metal sulphides can be regarded as salts of H)S, and since it is dibasic

v0 series of salts can be derived from it, the hydrogen sulphides. e.g.
NaHS, and the normal sulphides, e.g Na.S.

HS + NaOH > NaHS + HO
H)S + NaHS — Na,S + H,0
The alkali metal sul

: phides are all soluble in water and hydro! Y
(a 1M solution wal . heehee

bout 90% hydrolysed), so they are strongly basic.
