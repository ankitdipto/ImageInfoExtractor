¢ The reactions of cellular respiration are oxidation-
reduction (redox) reactions. Those that require a net
input of free energy are coupled to the cleavage of
ATP, which releases free energy.

* The mechanics of cellular respiration are often
dictated by electron behavior, which is in turn
influenced by the presence of electron acceptors.
Some atoms, such as oxygen, are very electronegative
and thus behave as good oxidizing agents.

9.2 Cellular respiration oxidizes food molecules.

1. What is the difference
between an autotroph and a
heterotroph? How does each
obtain energy?

2. What is the difference
between digestion and
catabolism? Which provides
more energy?

 

¢ In eukaryotic cells, the oxidative respiration of
pyruvate takes place within the matrix of
mitochondria.

¢ The electrons generated in the process are passed
along the electron transport chain, a sequence of
electron carriers in the inner mitochondrial
membrane.

* Some of the energy released by passage of electrons
along the electron transport chain is used to pump
protons out of the mitochondrial matrix. The reentry
of protons into the matrix is coupled to the
production of ATP. This process is called
chemiosmosis. The ATP then leaves the
mitochondrion by facilitated diffusion.

3. Where in a eukaryotic cell
does glycolysis occur? What is
the net production of ATP
during glycolysis, and why is it
different from the number of
ATP molecules synthesized
during glycolysis?

4. By what two mechanisms can
the NADH that results from
glycolysis be converted back into
NAD+?

5. What is the theoretical
maximum number of ATP
molecules produced during the
oxidation of a glucose molecule
by these processes? Why is the
actual number of ATP molecules
produced usually lower than the
theoretical maximum?

¢ The catabolism of fatty acids begins with B-oxidation
and provides more energy than the catabolism of
carbohydrates.

94 Cells can metabolize food without oxygen.

6. How is acetyl-CoA produced
during the aerobic oxidation of
carbohydrates, and what happens
to it? How is it produced during
the aerobic oxidation of fatty
acids, and what happens to it
then?

 

¢ Fermentation is an anaerobic process that uses an
organic molecule instead of oxygen as a final electron
acceptor.

¢ It occurs in bacteria as well as eukaryotic cells,
including yeast and the muscle cells of animals.

7. How do the amounts of ATP
produced by the aerobic
oxidation of glucose and fatty
acids compare? Which type of
substance contains more energy
on a per-weight basis?

* Fermentation
