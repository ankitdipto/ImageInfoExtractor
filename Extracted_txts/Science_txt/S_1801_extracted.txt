‘Apart from water, the other hydrides are all posonous and have un-
pleasant odours ‘The hydrides decrease in stability from HO to HyS to
H,Se to HyTe (This s shown by the decrease n thei enthalpres of forma-
tion ~ Table 15 8 ) They become les stable because the bonding orbitals
become larger and more diffuse hence overlap with the hydrogen Is
orbitals less effective

‘The H—O—H bond angle in water 15 104°28", 19 accordance with the
VSEPR prediction of slightly less than tetrahedral due to the presence of
Jone pats of electzons Thus the orbitals used for bonding by O are close
top| hybrids In H,S, H,Se and HyTe the bond angles become close 10
90° ‘This suggests that almost pure p orbitals on Se and Te are used for
bonding to hydrogen

‘Ina series of simlar compounds, the bouling points usually ynerease a5
the atoms become larger and heavier If the boiling points increase, then
the volatihty decreases This trend 1s shown by the bosling pomnts of H:S,
H,Se. H,Te and HaPo, but the boiling point of water 1s anomalous

Water has an abnormally low volatihty because ts molecules are 2s
sociated with each other by means of hydrogen bonds in both the sold
and liguad states. The steucture of Liquid water ts not known for certain.
‘but probably consists of groups of two or three molecules hydrogen bonded
together The structure of ordinaty hexagonal ce 1s known At high press
tures other more dense structures are formed A total of mune different
forms of we are known X-ray studies do not often reveal the positions of
atoms In ths case the H positions were found by neutron diffraction on
solid deuterium oxide D,O The structure ss simar to wartate ZnS (see
Chapter 3), with O atoms occupying both the Zn'* and the $™ positions
‘The H atoms are located just off the line jorning two O atoms, and the
O—H 0 angle  104°28" The strength of a hydrogen bond 1s about
20KI mol™* Ths association s responsible for the abnormally high bating
point and melting point of water

“The H bonding 1s the main reason why covalent compounds have a very
low solubiity im water When two substances mx there 1s an increase 19
entropy since the order decreases ‘Thus mnxing 8 always favoured How
ever, the case of water, dissolving something means that hydrogen bonds
rust be broken Unless there 1 an interaction between the dissolved ma
teral and water ereater than the energy lost through breaking hydrogen
bonds. then the material will not dissolve Covalent materals have file
