‘up to eight sulphur atoms have been prepared

HS, H-S—S—S—S—H

HO; and HyS; have simular ‘skew" structures The dimensions of HO,
gas are shown in Figure 15 11 HO2 15 the smallest molecule known 0
show restricted rotation, 1m this case about the O—O bond, and this 5
presumably due to repulsion between the OH groups A similar structure
4s retnined in the liquid and soli, but the bond fengths and angles are
slightly changed because of hydrogen bonding

HO; and H,S3 can be prepared by the addition of acid to a peroxide or
a persulphide salt

BuO; + H;$0,—+ Hs; + B28O,
NaS: + HySO4—+ H2S3 (also HyS3) + NajSOx

In most of its reactions HsOz acts as a strong oxidizing agent In acide
solutions these reactions are often slow, but in basic solution they ate
usually fast Oz will oxidize Fe to Fe**, [Fe" (CN),))* (ferrocyan
ade) to [Fe""(CN),]*" (ferricyanide), NH,OH to HNO; and SO} to

Heating Na,O; with many organic compounds results im their oxidation 10
carbonates Fusing Na,O2 with Fe?* salts gives sodium ferrate Nax[FeOd)
which contains Fe(+VI)
With stronger oxidizing agents HO; 1s oxidized, that 1s HO? 1s forced
to act as a reducing agent, and in such cases Op 1s always evolved

Hydrogen peroxide

Pure H,0, 18 a colourless quid which resembles water quite closely
It 1s more hydrogen bonded than 1s water and so has a higher boiling
