point (b.p. 152°C, m.p. —0.4°C). It is more dense than water (density
14gem™*). Though it has a high dielectric constant, it is of little use as
an ionizing solvent because it is decomposed by many metal ions, and it
oxidizes many compounds.

H20> is a major industrial chemical, and 1 018 200 tonnes were produced
in 1991. It is used extensively as a mild bleaching agent for textiles
and paper/wood pulp. It is used for several environmental purposes: to
restore aerobic conditions in sewage waters, and to oxidize cyanides and
sulphides. It is an important rocket fuel. It is also used for making other
chemicals, particularly sodium peroxoborate Na2[B2(O2)2(OH),] -6H20
(annual production 700000 tonnes/year), which is used as a brightener in
washing powders (see Chapter 12). Organic peroxides are used to initiate
addition polymerization reactions (PVC, polyurethanes and epoxy resins),
and sodium chlorite NaCiQ, is used for bleaching. Smaller amounts of
H,0; are used to bleach hair, feathers, fats and waxes. It is used as an
oxidizing agent in the laboratory, and as an antiseptic to treat wounds. It is
useful to counteract chlorine, and in this reaction H,O2 behaves as a
reducing agent.

H,0, + Cl, > 2HCI + O2

H,0, is unstable, and the rate at which it decomposes (disproportion-

ates) depends on the temperature and concentration. Many impurities

alyse the decomposition, which may become very violent, especially

\ concentrated solutions. Catalysts include metal ions Fe?*, Fe**,

*, Ni?*, metal surfaces such as Pt or Ag, MnOz, charcoal or alkali —
even the small amount leached from glass.

At one time HO) was obtained by electrolysis of H2SO4 or (NH4)2SO4

at a high current density to form peroxosulphates, which were then
hydrolysed.

in a mixture of organic solvents (ester/hydrocarbon or octanol/methyl-
