‘The H,O; is extracted with water asa 1% solution. This is concentrated by
distillation under reduced pressure, and sold as 230% (by weight) solution
‘which has a pH of about 4.0 (85% solutions ave alko produced). 1,0;
solutions are stored in plastic or wax coated glass vessels, often with
negative catalysts such as urea or sodium stannate added 28 stabilizers,
Solutions keep qinte well, but must be handled with care since they may
explode with traces of organic material or specs of dust,

HALIDES

Compounds with the halogens are listed sn Table 15.9. Since F is more
electronegative than , binary compounds are oxygen fluorides, whereas
similar chlorine compounds are chlorine oxides Some of these compounds
including the oxides of iodine, are therefore described in Chapter 16 under
“Halogen oxides’,

Fluorine brings out the maximum valency of six with S, Se and Te, and
