SFo, SeF, and TeFs are all formed by direct combination. They are all col-
ourless gases and have an octahedral structure as predicted by the VSEPR
theory. The low boiling point indicates a high degree of covalency.

six unpaired electrons form bonds with six fluorine atoms,
hence octahedral shape

SF, is a colourless, odourless, non-flammable gas, which is insoluble in
water and extremely inert. It is used as a gaseous dielectric (insulator) in
high voltage transformers and switchgear. SeF, is slightly more reactive
and TeF, is hydrolysed by water. This is possibly due to the larger size
of Te which permits the larger coordination number necessary in the first
stage of hydrolysis.
TeF, + 6H20 — 6HF + HeTeO,.

Coordination numbers greater than 6 are not common, but TeF, does add
F> ions, forming [TeF7]~ and [TeFs]?~ mo,

Many tetrahalides are known. It is difficult to prepare tetrafluorides by
direct combination even with diluted F,, because they readily change to
hexafluorides. SF, is gaseous, SeF, liquid and TeF, solid. They have been
prepared:

S + F, (diluted with Nz) — SF, and SF,
3SCl, + 4NaF — SF, + S2Cl, + 4NaCl
S + 4CoF; — SF, + 4CoF,
SeCl, + 4AgF > SeF, + 4AgCl
TeO, + 2SeF, > TeF, + 2SeOF,
SF; is highly reactive, but is more stable than the lower fluorides. In con-
trast to the relatively stable hexafluorides, the tetrahalides are very sensitive

to water.
SF, + 2H,O > SO, + 4HF
SF. is a powerful fluorinating agent. ;
3SF, + 4BCl,; > 4BF; + 3Ch + 3SCh
SSF, + 1,05 > 2IF; + SOSF,
I is a useful selective fluorinating agent for organic chemicals, for
example:
R—COOH > R—CF,
R:C=O = R,CF;
R—CHO — R—CHF,
R—OH — RF
