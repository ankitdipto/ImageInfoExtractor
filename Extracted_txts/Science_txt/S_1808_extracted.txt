The dihalides form angular molecules, based on a tetrahedron with two
positions occupied by lone pairs. The lone pairs distort the tetrahedral
angle of 109°28' to 103° in SC, 101.5° in F,O and 98° in TeBr2.

Dimeric monohalides such as S2F2, SClz, Se2Clz and Se2Br2 are formed
by direct action between S and Se and the halogens. These monohalides
are hydrolysed slowly and tend to disproportionate.

S,Cl, is a toxic yellow liquid (m.p. —76°C, b.p. 138°C), with a revolting
smell. It is commercially important in vulcanizing rubber, and in preparing
chlorohydrins. The use of S,Cl, has been described earlier for making
rings of sulphur atoms with 7—20 atoms.

HS, + S:Cl, > Sir + 2HCI
It can also be used to make dichlorosuly .anes.
H,S,, + 282Clz > Sin+4yClz + 2HCI

The structure of S,Cl, and the other monohalides is similar to that of
H,02, with a bond angle of 104° which is due to distortion by two lone
Pairs. ‘ -

SoF is an unstable compound. It is formed by the action of a mild
fluorinating agent such as AgF on S. (Direct reaction of S with F gives
SF,, and even when the F is diluted with Nz it gives SFs.) S2F2 exists in two
different isomeric forms, F—S—S—F (like CI—S—S—Cl and H—O—
O—H), and thiothionyl fluoride S=SF.

! The compound SF, has an unusual structure, of two octahedra joined
logether,
