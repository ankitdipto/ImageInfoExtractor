Frgore 15 14 Structure of NS,

‘The best knowin 1s tetrasulphur tetramitrde SiN. and this the starting
‘point for many other SN compounds SN; may be made as follows

6SCI, + LONHy — S.Ny +25 + 14NHLCI

65:Chy + JONHs<S SAN, + 8S + I2NH,CL
js + ANHCI— SiN, + 85 + I6HCL

 

SiNs 1 a solid, m p_ 178°C. Its thermachromuc that 18 changes colour
vwith temperature AC liquid nttcogen temperatures i's almost colourless,
but at room temperature 1s orange~yellow, and at 100°C wis red Its
stable in air, but may detonate with shock, ghnding or sudden heating
The structure asa heterocycle ing. ‘Thi 8 cradle shaped and die
structurally from the Sy ring which s crown shaped ‘The X-ray structure
(Figure 15 14) shows that the average S—N bond length 181 62. Since
the sum of the covalent radu for $ ond Nis 178A. the S—N bonds seem
to hase some double bond character The fact that the bonds ate of equal
length sugzests that this 1s delocaled. The SS distances at the top
and bottom of the eradle are 2S8A The van der Waals (non bonded)
stance $$ 45 330A. and the single bond distance S—S 12 208A
‘This indicates weak S~S bonding, and SN, 1s thus a cage structure

Many different sizes of ings exist, for example eyelo S:Ns cyclo SiN
exelo-S.NiCI cyclo SiN\Ch In addition bicyclo compounds 8y)Ns, SN
SiN. SuiNy and SywNy ate haowa. The last fous may be regacded as wo
heterocycle SN rings, with the N atoms joined through a chain of I-58
S atoms

Sees very slowly hydrolysed by water but reaets rapidly with watm
NaOH with the break-up of the rng

 

SiN, + 6NAOH + 3H;0 — NavSsOy + 2Na,SOy + 4NHy

If SiN 1s treated with AgsF in CCl, solution then SiNsFi 1s formed Ths
has an exght-membered S—N ring with the F atoms bonded to § Ths
resus from breaking the SS bonds atross the sing. Sumulatly the for
mation of adducts such as SuNy BF, or S.Ny_SbF« (in which the extra
£10up 15 bonded to N) breaks the S—S bonds and increases the mean
SN distance from 162A to 168A This 18 presumably because the
electron attracting power of BFy or SbF« withdraws some ofthe x electron
density

Reduction of SN, with SnCl; an MeOH gwves tetrasulphur tetcamide
‘Su(NH)__ Several amides can be made by reacting SiN, with S, or $;Cl
swith NH, These tmides are related to an S, ring in which one of more
S atoms have been replaced by jmide NH groups. for example in S;NH
SANH)s, SNH): and SNH),

if $.N, 8 vaporized under reduced pressure and pasced through slver
‘ool then disulphur dinitrogen SN; 1s formed
