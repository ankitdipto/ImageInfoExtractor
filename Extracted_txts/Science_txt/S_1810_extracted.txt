\ ORGANO DERIVATIVES ,

S,Np is a crystalline solid. which is insoluble in water but soluble in many
organic solvents. It explodes with shock or heat. The. structure 1s cyclic
and the four atoms are very nearly square planar.

The most important reaction of S.N> is the slow polymerization of the
solid or vapour to form polythiazy! (SN),. This is a bronze coloured shiny
solid that looks like a metal. It conducts electricity and conductivity in-
creases as the temperature decreases, which is typical of a metal. It be~
comes a superconductor at 0.26K. The crystal structure shows that the
four-membered rings in S:N2 have opened and polymerized into a long
chain polymer. The atoms have a zig-zag arrangement, and the chain is
almost flat. Conductivity is much greater along the chains than in other
directions, and so the polymer behaves as a one-dimensional metal. The
resistivity is quite high at room temperature (about | x 10’ phohmcm along
achain), but this falls to about | x 10° wohm cm at 4K. (See Appendix J
for values for other elements.)

ORGANO DERIVATIVES

Oxygen forms many organo derivatives RO, which are called ethers.
Similar derivatives of S, Se and Te may be prepared using Grignard or
organolithium reagents:

SCly + 2LiR "SS RAS + 2LiCI
SCl, + 4RMgCI > R,S + 4MgCly

Dialkyl sulphides R2S have a similar structure to water (tetrahedral with
two positions occupied by lone pairs), and the lone pairs make them useful
donor molecules.

Haemoglobin is the pigment in the blood of most animals. It is red when
dioxygen is present and blue when there is no dioxygen. Haemoglobin is es-
sential for absorbing molecular dioxygen in the lungs, where it forms oxy-
haemoglobin. Oxyhaemoglobin releases the dioxygen in the parts of the
body where it is needed. forming (reduced) haemoglobin. Haemoglobin
