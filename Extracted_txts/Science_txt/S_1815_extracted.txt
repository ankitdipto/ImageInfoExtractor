INTRODUCTION

‘The name halogen comes from the Greek, and means salt former The
clements all react directly with metals to form salts and they are also very
reactive with non-metals Fluorme 1s the most reactive element known

The elements all have sesen electrons im therr outer shell The s'p*
configuration 1s one p electron less than that of the next noble gas Thus
atoms complete their octet either by acquiring an electron (1 ¢ through
forming an ionic bond gising X~) or bs sharing an electron with another
‘tom (thus forming a covalent bond) Compoueds with metals are typical
tonic whilst those with non-metals are covalent

The halogens show very close group similarities Fluorine (ihe fist
clement in the group) differs m several ways from the rest of the group
‘The first element of each of the main groups ail show differences from the
‘subsequent elements The reasons for the difference are

1 The first clement 1s smaller than the rest, and holds ts electrons more
firmly .
2 Ithas no low-lying d orbitals which may be used for bonding

‘The properties of chlorine and bromine are closer than those between
the other patrs af elements because their sizes are closer. The igmic radi
