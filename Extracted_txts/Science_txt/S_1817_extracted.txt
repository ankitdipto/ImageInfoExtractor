lorie the twentieth These 1wo elements are reasonably abundant but
‘bromine and todine are comparatively rare

The main source of fluorine 1 the mineral CaF called fuorspar oF
fiuorte (The name luorspar was given because the mineral luoresces
‘hat is i emats ght when its heated ) World production was 3 6 milion
tonnes in 1992. The largest producers are China 42% Mexico Mongolia
land the Soviet Union 8% cach and South Africa 7% Another wel
knowa fluotine containing mineral 1s fuoroapatite [3(Cax(POs): Ce]
‘Thus used pamanily asa source of phosphorus. It 1S not used to produce
HF and Fs because the mineral contains appreciable amounts of S10 The
HE produced reacts with the SiO the mineral to form fuorosiici acid
Ho(SiFa] Some He[SiFy] 5 made so this way and s used a8 an alternative
to Naf for luoridizing danking water ‘The mineral eryolite Nay[AlFs}1s
rather rare Its found only in Greentand and 1s used in the electrolyte
extraction of aluminium

‘The most abundant compound of chlorine 1s NaC}. and at 1s used to
produce virtually ali the Cl and HC! made World consumption of NaCl
‘was 183 5 milion tonnes m 1992. Some salt 1s mined and some sobtamned
by solar evaporation of sea water Chlondes and bromides are leached
from the land by rain and ate washed into the sea Sea water usually
contanas about 15000ppm (1 5%) of NaCl Certain inland seas contain
much more (the Dead Sea contains 8% and the Great Salt Lake Utah
contains 2396) The dried up beds of inland lakes and seas contain large
deposits of NaCl mixed with smaller amounts of CaCl KCl and MgCh
Incontrast the fdaride content of sea water is very low (1 2ppmm) This
because the water cdntains a large concentration of Ca * and Coss
ansoluble

Bromides occur in sea water fodides oaly occur in low concentration in
sea water but they are absorbed and concentrated by seaweed At one
lume sodine was extracted from seaweed “There are now beter sources
Natural brines have higher concentrations of | Sodium rodate NaTOy 2nd
sodium periodate NalO, occur as impurities in NaNO; deposits in Chile

EXTRACTION AND USES OF THE ELEMENTS

Fluorine

Fluorine 1s extremely reactwve and this causes great difficulties in the
preparation and handling of the element ‘The first preparation of fluorine
