Cylinders of F are now commercially available However, for many
purposes Fz s converted to CIF, (b p_ 12°C), which though very restive

Production of fluorine first became important for the manvfactut of
organic uordes such as AIF, and synthetie Nax[AlF,] Both are wed in
the extraction of aluminium The natural mineral eryoite 1s only found a
Greenland, and this source 1s largely exhausted

Te was discovered 1n the 19405 that the asotopes of uranium could be
separated by gaseous diffusion of UF, This was smportant an preparing
‘enriched uranium to make the first atomic bomb Gaseous diffusion stil
used to make ennched uramum fuel for nitclear reactors The nuclear
industry uses about 75% of the fluorine produced UF s made as follows

U or UO; + HF UF,
UF, + F,—+ UF,
UF, + CIF, > UF,
