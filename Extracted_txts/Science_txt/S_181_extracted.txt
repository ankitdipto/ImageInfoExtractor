Photosynthetic Machine

Life is powered by sunshine. The energy used by most liv-
ing cells comes ultimately from the sun, captured by plants,
algae, and bacteria through the process of photosynthesis.
The diversity of life is only possible because our planet is
awash in energy streaming earthward from the sun. Each
day, the radiant energy that reaches the earth equals about
1 million Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. Photosynthesis
captures about 1% of this huge supply of energy, using it to
provide the energy that drives all life.

The Photosynthetic Process: A Summary

Photosynthesis occurs in many kinds of bacteria and algae,
and in the leaves and sometimes the stems of green plants.
Figure 10.2 describes the levels of organization in a plant
leaf. Recall from chapter 5 that the cells of plant leaves
contain organelles called chloroplasts that actually carry
out the photosynthetic process. No other structure in a
plant cell is able to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthe-

Journey into a leaf. A plant leaf possesses a thick layer of cells (the mesophyll) rich in chloroplasts. The flattened thylakoids in the
chloroplast are stacked into columns called grana (singular, granum). The light reactions take place on the thylakoid
