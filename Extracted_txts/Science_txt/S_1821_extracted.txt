ever a modified Deacon process 1s now used to a smal extent It utes
HCI obtained as a by product from the pyrolysis of 1 2-dichloroethane
to vinyl chlonde, and uses an improved catalyst (CuCl; with didymuum
‘oxide a8 promoter, didymium 1s an old name meaning twin" and icon
sists of two lanthanide elements prascodymium and neodymiim) Ths
works at a slightly lower temperature than the original process
cH.c-cH,c1 2S,

CChiorine gas 1s toxic. It was used as a porson gas in World War 1 The
gas detectable by smell at a concentration of 3pm and 1S ppra causes a
Sore throat and running eves. Higher concentrations cause coughing hung
damage, and death

‘World production of ehlorine 1s about 35 3 million tonnes per yea (the
Soviet Union 43%, the USA 24%, Germany 7%, Canada and France 3%
‘each, and Japan and the UK 2% each) About two thirds of ths 1s used to
‘make organic chloro compounds one fifth for bleachmg, and the rest for
the manufacture ofa varety of inorganic chemicals. The main two organ
compounds produced are

1 2alichtoroethane

vinyl chloride monomer
Both are used in the plastics industry Other uses include the production
of

chlonnated solvents including methy! and ethyl chlorides

perchioro and dichloroethene

mono dh and tchlorobenzene

benzene hexachlonide

the insecheide DD’

chlorinated phenols

plant growth hormones (24 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2.4.6

tmchlorophenoxyacetic seid are used as selective weedkillers)
Large amounts of chlorine are used for bleaching textiles, wood. pulp and
paper Chionine is widely used throughout the developed world to puny
‘dninking water, because it kills bacteria It ss also used to make a wide
vanety of imorganie chemicals including

bleaching powder

sodium hypochlorite NaOCl

chlorine dioxide C10

sodium chlorate NaClOy

many metal and ton metal chlorides

 

 

Bromine

Bromine 1s obtained from sea water and brine lakes Sea water contams
about 65ppm Br” Thus 15 tonnes of sea water contain about 1kg of|
bromine Bromine 1s extracted from sea water, but st 18 more econome
