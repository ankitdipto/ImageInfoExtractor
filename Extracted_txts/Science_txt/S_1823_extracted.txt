Astaune

Astatine does not occur m nature, but over twenty artfisal sotopes até
bbeen made Allof these are adioacuve The most stable wotopes are
(half fe 83 hours), and *At (half fe 7 5 hours) The later was fs
made in 1940 by a nuclear reaction in which busmuth was bornbarded Wh

‘Tracer methods were used to study the chemistry of "At, using mime

capture and by a-emission (sce Chapter 31 under ‘Modes of deét¥’)

Astatine appears to resemble rodine quite closely
