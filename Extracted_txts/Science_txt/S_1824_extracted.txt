IONIZATION ENERGY

The ionization energies of the halogens show the usual trend to smaller
values as the atoms increase in size. The values are very high, and there is
little tendency for the atoms to lose electrons and form positive ions.

nate ionization energy for F is appreciably higher than for the others,
preause of its small size. F always has an oxidation state of (—1) except in
2» n forms compounds either by gaining an electron to form F~, or by

sharing an electron to form a covalent bond.
; Hydrogen has an ionization energy of 1311kJ mol~', and it forms H*
ions nt is at first surprising that the halogens Cl. Br and I have lower
Habe energies than H, yet they do not form simple X* ions. The
ison energy is the energy required to produce an ion from a single
sothes Baseous atom. Usually we have a crystalline solid, or a solution,
the lattice energy or hydration energy must also be considered. Because
in solunne a crystals containing H* have a high lattice energy, and
negative . the pydration energy is also very high (1091 kJ mol"). The
beens an iso have a hydration energy. Thus H™ ions are formed
chee Taitiee energy, or the hydration energy, exceeds the ionization
hydrevon cor rast the halide ions X* would be large and thus have low
than the tong ‘attice energies. Since the ionization energy would be larger
attice energy or hydration energy, these ions are not normally
