‘These are discussed later under ‘Baste properties of the halogens’

‘The electron affinities for the halogens are all negative This shows that
energy is evolved when a halogen atom gains an electron, and X—+ X™
‘Thus, the halogens all form halide rons

‘TYPE OF BONDS FORMED AND OXIDATION STATES
‘Most compounds formed by the halogens and metals are sone However,

De eC RONS covalent halides are formed in afew cases where the metal 1005 are very

‘The halogens all have very high electronegauviy values (see Table
