(+11), (+V) and (+VIJ): These higher valency states are covalent, and
arise quite logically by promoting electrons from filled p and s levels to
empty d levels. The unpaired electrons then form three, five or seven
covalent bonds. There are numerous examples of higher valency states in
the interhalogens and halogen oxides.

Cl,0¢ and BrO3.

MELTING AND BOILING POINTS

The melting and boiling points of the elements increase with increased
atomic number. At room temperature, fluorine and chlorine are gases,
bromine is liquid, and iodine is a solid. In temperate climates, only two
elements are liquid at room temperature, bromine and mercury. (In very
hot climates caesium and thallium are also liquid.) At atmospheric pres-
sure 1, solid sublimes without ‘melting. ,
