OND ENERGY IN X, MOLECULE

‘The elements all form diatomic molecules It would be expected that the
bond energy in the Xz molecules would decrease as the atoms become
larger, since increased size results in less effective overlap of orbitals Cle
Brz and I, show the expected trend (Table 16 7), but the bond energy for
F, does not fit the expected trend

“The bond energy in F3 1s abnormally low (126k mol™!) and zhis 15
largely responsible for sts very high reacttity (Other elements in the fst
row of the periodic table also have weaker bonds than the elements which
follow im their respective groups For example in Group 15 the N—N
bond in hydrazine ts weaker than P—P, and in Group 16 the O—O bond
1m peroxides 1s weaker than S—S ) Two different explanations have been
suggested for the low bond enerey

1 Mulhken postulated that an Chy Bra and f, some pd hybnéaaton
occurred allowing some mulypic bonding This would make the bonds
steonger than un F: in which there are no d orbitals available

2 Coulson suggested that since fluorine atoms are small the F—F
distance 1s also small (148A) and hence internuclear repulsion 1
appreciable The large electron—clectton repulsions between the lone
Patrs of electrons on the two fluorine atoms weaken the bond

It seems unnecessary to invoke multiple bonding to explain these facts,
and the simpler Coulson explonation 1s widely accepted

OXIDIZING POWER

Electron affinity 1s the tendency of the atoms to gain electrons Ths
reaches a maximum at chlonne (See Table 16 4) Oxidation may be
regarded as the temoval of electrons, so that an oxidizing agent gas
electrons Thus the halogens act as oxidizing agents The strength: of an
‘ondizing agent (that ss oxidation potential) depends on several energy
terms and 1s best represented by a Born=Haber type of energy Ge
