Figure 16.3 Energy cycle showing the oxidation potentials of the halogens.
(Oxidation potential is used here in preference to reduction potential to stress that
the halogens are strong oxidising agents. Note AG° = —nFE°)

FlaGcohay tO Kfiyaratea). Thus the oxidation potential is equal to the sum of
the energy put in as the enthalpies of fusion, vaporization and dissocia-
tion, less the energy evolved as the electron affinity and enthalpy of
hydration.

In a similar cycle the oxidation potential for bromine can be calculated:
for the change from 3Brociquiay to Brihydrateay: (Note that since in its stan-
dard state bromine is liquid, the enthalpy of fusion must be omitted.
Similarly in calculating the oxidation potential for chlorine and fluorine,
