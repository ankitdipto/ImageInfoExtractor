GROUP 17_THE HALOGENS 1

 

since they are gases both the enthalptes of fusion and vaporzation mus,
be omitted )

‘Chlorine has the highest electron affimty, so gaseous Cl atoms accept
electrons most readily However, Cls not the strongest oxidizing agent
‘Table 16 8 shows that, summung all the energy terms in the cycle, fuonne
has the most negative AF? value Since the difference between AG" and
‘AH? ts not significant, x follows that fluorine accepts electrons more readily
than chlorine, so fluorine 15 the strongest oxidizing agent ‘There are two
‘main reasons for this change of order

1 Fyhasa low enthalpy of dissociation (arising from the weakness of the
F-F bond)

2 Eyhasa high free energy of hydration (arssing from the smaller size of
the F~ ton)

Fluorine ssa very strong oxidizing agent, and it will replace C1” both a
solution and also when dry Smfarly, ehtonine gas wall displace Br from
solution (This is the basis of the commercial extraction of bromine from
sea water) In general any halogen of low atomic number will ondze
halide tons of higher atomic mummber

REACTION WITH WATER

“The halogens are all soluble in water, but the extent to which they react
with the water, and the reaction mechanism that 1 followed, vary Fluonne
1s so strong an oxidizing agent that it oxidizes water to dioxygen The
reaction 1s spontaneous and strongly exothermic (The free energy change
1s large and negative ) Oxidation may be regarded as the removal of
electrons, so that an oxidizing agent gains electrons Thus the Quorne
atoms are reduced to fluoride rons

‘A similar reaction between chlonne and water 1s thermodynamcally
possible, but the reaction 1s very slow because the energy of activation
ss high
