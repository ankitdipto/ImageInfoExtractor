HYDROGEN HALIDES HX

It is usual to refer to pure anhydrous HX compounds as hydrogen halides,
and their aqueous solutions as hydrohalic acids or simply halogen acids.

The halogens all react with hydrogen and form hydrides HX, though
except for HCI this is not the usual way of preparing them. Reactivity
towards hydrogen decreases down the group. Hydrogen and fluorine react
violently. The reaction with chlorine is slow in the dark, faster in day-
light, and explosive in sunlight. The reaction with iodine is slow at room
temperature.

HF

Industrially HF is made by heating CaF, with strong H»SO,. The reaction
is endothermic: herice the need for heating.-It is important that SiO,
impurities are removed from the CaF>, as otherwise they consume much
of the HF produced.

CaF, + H»SO, > CaSO, + 2HF
SiO, + 4HF — SiF, + 2H,0
SIF, + 2HF (qq) —> H[SiFe) -

The HF is purified.by successive washing, cooling and fractional distilla~
tion, giving a product that is 99.95% pure. World production of HF was
1.5 million tonnes in 1994, with over 80000 tonnes a year being produced
in the UK.

Gaseous HF is very toxic, and should be handled only in a good fume
cupboard. Solutions of HF are called hydrofluoric acid, and this is very
corrosive. Hydrofluoric acid is normally handled in metal apparatus made
of copper or Monel, because hydrofluoric acid attacks glass with the
formation of fluorosilicate ions [SiF,]?~

SiO, + 6HF = [SiF,]?- + 2H* + 2H,O

Surprisingly little corrosion occurs at concentrations above 80%. The main
uses of HF are as follows:

1. Two thirds are used to make chlorofluorocarbons (Freons). These are
Sometimes called CFCs. They are used as refrigerating fluids and as the
Propellant in aerosols. The use of CFCs is being phased out because

~ they damage the ozone layer-in the upper atmosph
