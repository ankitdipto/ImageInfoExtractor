2 About 14% 1s used to make AIF, and syatheteeryolite used sn the
electrolytic extraction of alumanium (See Chapter 3)

3 About 2% 1s used for uramum processing (through sntermediates UF,
and UF)

4 About 46 1s used in the anhydrous form as an alkylation catalyst m
the petrockemieal industry, for making long chain alkylbenzene
compounds These are then converted into alkylbenzene sulphonates
and used 2s detergents

5 Aqueous HF 1 used for pickling stet (about 4%) and for etching las,
‘making herbicides and many metal fluorides and also BF,

BO, + HF SO, oRF, + FESO, HAO.
ALO, + GHI —+ 2AIF, + 34:0

HCI produced on a very large scale World production was 123 milion

tonnes in 1991 (USA 24%, China 21%, Germany and Japan 7% exch

France and Italy 5% each, and Belgrum 3%) There are several diferent

preparative methods

1 At one tume HCI was made excluswely by the ‘salt eake method
Inthis method, concentrated H;SO, was added to rock salt (NaCl) The
reaction was endothetm, and was performed in wo stages at diffrent,
temperatures The fist ofthe reactions was earned out at about 180°C
“The solid NaCl reacted with HaSO, and became coated with usoeble
NaHSO,. This prevented further reaction, and accounts for the name
“salteake' Inthe second stage, the muxture was heated to about $$0°C,
when further reaction with HsSO, occurred and Na;SO, was formed
‘Thus by-product was sold, mostly for paper making (Kraft proces)

NaCt + HsS0.2S HCl + NaHSO.
NaCl + NaHSO, SS. HCI + NasSOx

2 Large amounts of pure HCI have become available mn recent yea
asa by product from the heavy organie chemical ndustey For example
HCI1s produced inthe conversion of 1.2 dichloethane CH;Cl—CHCl
to vinyl chlonde CHy=CHC, and in the manufacture of chlonate
ethanes and chlorinated florocarbons This now the largest source of
Hl

3 High punty HCI 1s made by direct combination of the elements A
gaseous mixture of H+ and Cls1s explosive However, the reaction PO
ceeds quietly ifthe gases are burnt in a hydrogen=chlorine ame 18 2
specral combustion chamber The process strongly exothermic

4 HCI is conveniently made in the laboratory by treating NHCI wth
concentrated H;SO, NH,CI costs more than NaCl (which was wed
an the “salt cake” process) However, NHjCI is preferred because
