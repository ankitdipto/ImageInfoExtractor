NH,HSO, is soluble, and the reaction does not stop at the halfway
stage.
2NH,CI + H2SO4— 2HCI + (NH4)2SO4

Hydrogen chloride gas is very soluble in water. Aqueous solutions of
HCt are sold as hydrochloric acid. A saturated solution at 20°C contains
42% HCI by weight, and ‘concentrated’ acid normally contains about 38%
HCI by weight (approx. 12M). Pure hydrochloric acid is colourless, but
technical grades are sometimes yellow because of contamination by
Fe(III). The largest use is for ‘pickling’ metals, that is removing oxide
layers from the surface. It is also used to make metal chlorides, in the
manufacture of dyestuffs, and in the sugar industry.

Gaseous HCl is conveniently prepared in the laboratory from concen-
trated HCl and concentrated H2SO,.

HBr and HI

HBr and HI are made by the reaction of concentrated phosphoric acid
HPO, on metal bromides or iodides, in a similar reaction to the ‘salt cake’
process for HCI. Note that a non-oxidizing acid such as phosphoric acid
must be used. Concentrated H2SO, is a strong oxidizing agent and would
oxidize HBr to Br2 and HI to I.

HPO, + Nal > HI + NaH2PO,

The usual laboratory preparation involves reducing bromine or iodine
with red phosphorus in water. Thus HBr is made by adding bromine to a
mixture of red phosphorus and water. For HI, water is added to a mixture
of phosphorus and iodine.

HF is only just liquid at room temperature (b.p. 19.9°C), and HCI to
HBr and HI are gases. The boiling points increase regularly from HCl,
