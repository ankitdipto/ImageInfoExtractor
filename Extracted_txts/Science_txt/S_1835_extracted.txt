HBr to HI, but the value for HE 1s completely out of line with the others

‘The unexpectedly high boiling point of HF arises because of the hy-
<drogen bonds formed between the F atom of one mofecule and the H atom
‘of another molecule This inks the molecules together as (HF),, and they
form ng zag chamns in both the liquid and the solid Some’ hydrogen
bonding also occurs nthe gas, which consists of a mixture of cyclic (HF),
polymers, dimen (HF);, and monomeric HF HCl, HBr and Hil are not
fhydrogen bonded sm the gas and Inquid, though HCl and HBr are weakly
hydrogen bonded in the solid

Hydrogen bonds are generally weak (5~35%) mol!) compared with
normal covalent bonds (C—C 34743 mol”), but their effect 1s hugh
significant The most electronegative elements luonine and oxygen (andto
2 lesser extent ehlonine) form the strongest hydrogen bonds (The bond
energy of the hydrogen bond in F—H  F 1s 29k) mol”! in HF)

In the gaseous state the hydnides are essentially covalent Howevtr
im aqueous solutions they 1orize H1* are not produced since the proton
1s transferred from HC\ to H,0, thus giving [}1,0]* HCI, HBr and Hi
sonize almost completely and are therefore strong acids HF only ronzes
slightly and 1s therefore a weak acid

HCl + HO ~ [}H,0]* + C1"

‘The aqueous solutions form azeotropre mixtures with maximum boing
points, because of @ negative deviation from Raoult s law Azcotropie
mixtures are sometimes used as standards for volumetric analysis, because
the azcotrope always has the same composition

Though HCl, HBr and HI completely ionize in water, the degree of
sonizatin 1s much less n poorer rontzing solvents such as anhydrous acetic
seid HCI tonizes fess than HI in glacial acenc acid as solvent Thus in
acetic aid, Hl 1s the strongest acid, followed by HBr and FCI, and HF's
the weakest

Its at first paradoxical that HF 1s the weakest acid in water, siace HF
has a greater electronegatnty difference than the other hydndes and
therefore has more tonte character However, acidie strength 1s the tet
dency of hydrated molecules to form hydrogen tons
