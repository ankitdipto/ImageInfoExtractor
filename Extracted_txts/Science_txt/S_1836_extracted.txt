Figure 16.5 Energy cycle showing the acid strengths of the halogens.

The acid strength is equal to the sum of all the energy terms round the
energy cycle in Figure 16.5.
acid strength = _ enthalpy of dehydration
+ enthalpy of dissociation
+ ionization energy of H*
+ electron affinity X~
+ enthalpy of hydration of H* and X7~

The factors which make HF the weakest halogen acid in water become

apparent if the various thermodynamic terms are examined in more detail.
