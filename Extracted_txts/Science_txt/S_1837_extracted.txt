(where AG? 1s the Gibbs standard free energy R the gas constant and
T the absolute temperature) However AG depends on the chenge tt
enthalpy AMY and the change in entropy AS

AG = AH - TAS

‘Table 16 13 shows the enthalpy changes (A/) for the various stages 9 the
above energy cycle

Consider first the total enthalpy change AH for the dissociation of
HX oie ran MO Hite AND Xnse sy The AM values for the ¥2M005
halogen acids are all negative which means that energy 1s evolved 1" the
[process so the change 1s thermodynamically possible However the Value
fot HF 1s smal! compared with the values for HC] HBr and HI Ths HF
ss only slightly exothermic in aqueous salution whereas the athers vole
a considerable amount of heat

The low total AH value for HF 1s the result of several factors,

1 The enth dps of dawociation show that the H—F bond uct
stronger than the HCl H—Br or H—T bonds Thus the dissociation
energy of HF 1s neulv twice that required to dissociate HI. (The
strength of the HF hond is also shown by the short bond length of 1 0A
‘compored with 1 7A in HI)

2 The enthalpy of dehydration for the step HXpyemeey > HXc) #
much higher for HF than for the others This 1s because of the SUOMS
hydrogen bonding which occurs in aqueous HF solutions

3 The unexpactedly low value for the electron affinity of F~ also cot
{nutes and though the enthilpy of hydration of Fis very high 1
not enough to offset these other terms

If alfowance 1s made for the TAS term the AH values can be cometted

into corresponding AG values From these the dssocration constotts 2

obtamed HF A = 10-* HCTA = 10" HBr k = 10" and HI & = 10°
The dissociation constants show quite clearly that HF is only very Sie)
