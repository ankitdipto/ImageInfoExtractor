ionized in water, and is therefore a weak acid. In a similar way, the others
are almost totally dissociated, and are therefore strong acids.
Liquid HF has been used as a non-aqueous solvent. It undergoes self-
ionization:
2HF = [H2F]* + F-

Acid—base reactions occur in this solvent system. However, the solvent
itself has a very strong tendency to donate protons. Thus when the familiar
mineral acids HNO3, H2SO, and HCl are dissolved in HF, the mineral
acids are forced to accept protons from the HF. Thus the so-called mineral
acids are actually behaving as bases in this solvent. The very strong proton
donating powers of HF mean that very few substances act as acids in HF.
Perchloric acid is an exception, and it does behave as an acid. The only
other known acids in liquid HF are fluoride acceptors such as SbFs, NbFs,
AsF; and BF;. Many compounds react with HF, thus limiting its usefulness
as a solvent. It is a useful medium for preparing fluoro complexes such as
[SbF,]~, and fluorides.

HALIDES

Tonic halides

Most halides where the metal has an oxidation state of (+I), (+), or
+(III) are ionic. This includes Group 1, Group 2 (except Be), the lan-
thanides, and some of the transition metals. Most ionic halides are soluble
in water, giving hydrated metal ions and halide ions. A few are insoluble:
LiF, CaF,, StF;, BaF, and the chlorides, bromides and iodides of Ag(+)),
Cu(+1), Hg(+I) and Pb(+II). The solubilities usually increase from F~ to
Br to Cl” to I” (provided that they are all ionic), because the lattice
energy decreases as the ionic radii increase.

Molecular (covalent) halides

Among the metals which show variable valency, the highest oxidation state
is usually found with the fluorides. Thus osmium forms OsF,, but only
OsCl., OsBra and Osl,. High oxidation states are covalent. For a metal
with variable oxidation states, the higher oxidation states will be covalent
when yer ones ionic. For example, UFs is covalent and gaseous,
jonie. ‘4 1S an ionic solid. Similarly PbCl, is covalent and PbCl, is

» Most of the more electronegative elements also form covalent

halides, sometimes called molecular halides. A large number of these are

hydrolysed quite readily by water:
BCl, + 3H,0 > H3BO; + 3H* + 3CI~
SiCly + 4H,0 > Si(OH)4 + 4H* + 4CI7
PCl; + 3H.O — H3PO, + 3H* + 3CI-
PCI; + 4H2O + H,PO, + SH* + 5CI7
