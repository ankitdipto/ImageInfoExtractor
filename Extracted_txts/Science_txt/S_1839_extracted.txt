‘GROUP 17_THE HALOGENS ]

‘Sometimes when the maximum covalency 1s obtained the halides are nent
to water Thus CCl, and SF. are stable This 1s because of kinetic rather
than thermodynamic factors. and CCl, does hydrolyse wath superheated
steam to form phosgene COC, Molecular halides are usually gases or
volatile liquids ‘This ts because there are strong bonds within the molecule
but only weak van der Waals forces holding the molecules together A
number of fluondes show muluple bonding when the central atom has
suitable vacant orbitals This contributes to the high strength and shortness
fof many bonds of fluorine (B—F C—F N—F and P—F)

 

Bridging halides

Halide bridges are sometimes formed between two atoms (Less com
‘monly they are formed between three atoms ) Thus AICh forms a dimenc
structure whereas BeF and BeCly form mfinite chains “The bridges are
depicted as the halogen forming one normal covalent bond and donating
alone pate of electcans to form a second (coordinate) bond Both bonds
are identical The bridge may be described in molecular orbital terms as
a three centre four electron bond Halogen bridges involving chlorine
and bromine are typically bent but those involving fluorine may be either
bent or linear Several pentafluorides such as NDFs and TaF form cycle
tetramers with linear bridges

Preparation of anhydrous hades
‘There are several general methods for making anhydrous halides

Direct reaction of the elements

Most metals react vigorously with F and give fluorides in the highest
oxidation states Some non metals such as P and $ explode Elevated
temperatures are usually required to prepare chlondes bromides and
sodides
2Fe + 3Fs—+ 2FeFy
Fe + Bry FeB
Fe + I+ Fel

Reactions are easier ina solvent such as tetrahydrofuran though the
products are often solvated

 

Reacting the oxide with carbon and the halogen

{ts assumed that the carbon frst reduces the oxide to the metal follosed
