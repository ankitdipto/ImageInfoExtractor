Reaction of metal with anhydrous HX
Many metals will react with HF, HCI, HBr or HI gases.

Fe + 2HCI— FeCl, + Hy

Reaction of oxides with halogen compounds

Heating halogen compounds such as NH4Cl, CCl, CIF;, BrF3, S,Cl, or
SOCI; with oxides often gives halides.

Halogen exchange

Many halides will react either with the halogens, or with excess of another
halide and replace one halogen atom by another. Thus several metal
fluorides such as AgF2, ZnF2, CoF3, AsF3, SbF; and SbF; can be used to
make fluorides, and also HF.

CoCl, + 2HF — CoF, + 2HCI ’

Chlorides may be converted to iodides by treatment with KI in acetone.
Similarly KBr can be used for bromides.

TiCl, + 4KI > Til, + 4KCI

Dehydrating hydrated halides

Hydrated halides may be Prepared in a variety of ways, such as dissolving
carbonates, oxides or metals in the appropriate halogen acid. Evaporation
gives hydrated halides. Some of these may be dehydrated simply by
heating. or by heating in a vacuum, but oxohalides are often produced.
Chlorides may be dehydrated by distilling with thionyl chloride. Other
halides may be dehydrated by treatment with 2,2-dimethoxypropane.

HALOGEN OXIDES
re apounds with oxygen probably show greater differences between
ifferent halogens than any other class of compound. Differences
