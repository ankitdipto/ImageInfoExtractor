between F and the others arise for the usual reasons (small sz, lex of d
orbtals and high electeonegatiity) In addition oxygen ts less electra
negative than F, but more electronegative than Cl, Brand 1 Thus binary
compounds of F and O are fluondes of oxygen rather than oxides of
fone ‘The other halogens are less electronegative than oxygen and thus
form oxides There 1s only a small difference in electronegativity between
the halogens and oxygen, so the bonds are largely covalent Rather sur
pnsingly 1:0, and 1,0y are stable and onic

Most of the halogen oxides are unstable, and tend to explode when
subjected to shock, or sometimes even wien exposed to light ‘The iodine
oxides are the most stable, then the chlorine oxides, but the bromine
conides all decompose below room temperature The higher oxidation
states are more stable than the lower states. Of the compounds shown in
Table 16 14, C102, ClO, 140c and OF, are the most important

decomposes at ~95°C Its structure 1s similar to that of H,O>, except that
the O—O bond length of 1 221s much shorter than the O—O distance
of 148A in HO; The O—F bond lengths are 158A, which 1s much
