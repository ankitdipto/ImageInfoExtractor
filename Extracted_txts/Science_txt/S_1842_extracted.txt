1,0 Dichlorine monoxide

Cl,0 is a yellow-brown gas. It is commercially important. Both laboratory
and commercial preparations are by heating freshly precipitated (yellow)
mercuric oxide with the halogen gas diluted with dry air.

2Ch + 2HEO-—"S HeCh,-HgO + ClO
Cl,0 explodes in the presence of reducing agents, or NH3, or on heating.
3Cl,O + 10NH3— 6NH,C! + 2N2 + 3H20

Cl,O gas is very soluble in water (144g Cl,O dissolves in 100g H;O at
~9°C), forming hypochlorous acid. and the two are in equilibrium.

CLO + HO = 2HOCI
Cl,0 dissolves in NaOH solution, forming sodium hypochlorite.
Cl,O + 2NaOH > 2NaOCl + H20
Most of the Cl2O produced is used to make hypochlorites. NaOCl is sold
in aqueous solution. Ca(OCl)2 is a solid. An impure form mixed with
Ca(OH), and CaCl is sold as ‘bleaching powder’. The latter is also made
by passing Cl, into Ca(OH)». These are used to bleach wood pulp and

fabrics, and as disinfectants. Some Cl,O is used to make chlorinated
solvents.

"The structures of OF2, ClO and BrO are all related to a tetrahedron

with two positions occupied by lone pairs of electrons.

Repulsion between the lone pairs reduces the bond angle in F,O from the
tetrahedral angle of 109°28" to 103° (Figure 16.6). In Cl,O (and presum-

ably Br,O) the bond angle is increased because of steric crowding of the
larger halogen atoms.
