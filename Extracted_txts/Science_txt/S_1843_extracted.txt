C10, Chlorine dioxide ue

ClO; sa yellow gas which condenses to 2 deep red liquid, b p 11°C ta
spite of its high reacumty (or pethaps because of this) CIO, 1s of com-
trereal importance, and 1s the most amportant of the oxides ClO. 3
powerful oxidizing and chlocinating agent Large quantities are vsed for
fleaching wood pulp and cellulose, and for purifying drinking water tts
30 times as effective as chlorine in bleaching flour (to make whe bread)

ClO, liquid explodes above ~40°C The gas detonates readily when
concentrated above SOmm Hg paral pressure Tt explodes when med
‘wth reducing agents Because ofthis, tts made in situ and rs used diluted
‘with air or CO, The safest laboratory preparation 1s from sodium chlorate
and oxalic aed, a ths automatically dilutes the gas with CO;

“The gas 1s made commercslly from NaCIOy Its dificult to obtamn total
production figures, since for safety reasons ClO; 1s produced where its
‘used, and 1s always diluted (for safety) An estimate 13 200000 tonnes:
per year, half in the USA_A pure products formed using SOs Using HCI
causes contamination with Cl2, but this may be unimportant or even useful
for bleaching and stenitzation

ClO, dissolves in water, evolving heat, and giving a dark green solution
Ths decomposes very slowly in the dark, but rapidly af Mluminated

for bleaching texules and paper

‘Toe C1O, molecule 1 paramagnetic and contains an odd number of cles
trons. Odd electron molecules are generally highly reactive and CIO:
typical Odd electron molecules often dimetize 1m order to pair the elec
‘rons, but CIO, does not “This 1s thought to be because the oud electron
delocalized The molecule 15 angular with an O—CI—O angle of 118°
