Chlorine perchlorate Cl- clo,
This can be made by the following reaction at —45°C.
CsClO, + CIOSO2F > Cs(SO3)F + CIOCIO;

It is less stable than ClO2, and decomposes to OQ», Clz and Cl,O¢ at room
temperature.

Cl,0¢ Dichlorine hexoxide

C1,0, is a dark red liquid, which freezes to give a yellow solid at —180°C.
1,0, is in equilibrium with the monomer ClO3, and is made from ClO
and O3. The structure of neither the liquid nor the solid is known. Both
are diamagnetic, and so have no unpaired electrons. Possible structures
are shown in Figure 16.7.

Cl,Og is a strong oxidizing agent and explodes on contact with grease.
Hydrolysis of Cl,O, with water or alkali gives chlorate and perchlorate.
Reaction with anhydrous HF is reversible.

Dichlorine heptoxide Cl,O7

C120; is a colourless oily liquid. It is moderately stable and is the only
exothermic oxide of chlorine, but it is shock sensitive. It is made by care-
fully dehydrating perchloric acid with phosphorus pentoxide, or HPO, at
—10°C, followed by distillation at ~35°C and a pressure of 1mm Hg. Its
Structure is OxCI—O—CIOs, with a bond angle of 118°36’ at the central
oxygen, It is less reactive than the lower oxides, and does not ignite
Organic materials. It reacts with water, forming perchloric acid.
