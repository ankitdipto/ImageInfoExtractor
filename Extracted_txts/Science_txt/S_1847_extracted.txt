Jraur semies of oxoacids are known (Table 16 15) The structures of the
{ons formed ate shown in Figure 16 9 All these structures are based om 8
eirahedron The sp" hybnd ortutals used for bonding form only mesh &
bonds. Because the s and levels cffer apprecably in energy. The sos
ane tabtlzed by strong px~dr bonding between full 2p orbitals on oxyeea
th empty d orbitals on the halogen atoms Even so many ofthe oxoacds
Aare known only n solution or as thett salts

Fivorine has no d orbitals, and thus eannot form px~dn bonds For 3
{28 time st was thought that F could not form any oxoacids It 1s no
frown that HOF can be made under special conditions. but is verY
Unstable No other oxoacids of Fae known
