Hypohalous acids HOX

The hypohalous acids HOF, HOCI, HOBr and HOI are all known, and
the halogen has the oxidation state (+1).

HOF is a colourless unstable gas. It was first made in 1968, using the
matrix isolation technique. F, and HO were trapped in an unreactive
matrix of solid nitrogen. (This requires a very low temperature.) The
gases were photolysed, and the HOF formed. Since this too was trapped
in the solid nitrogen, it was unable to collide and react with any other
molecules such as HO, F, or Oz. Thus a product was obtained. More
recently HOF has been made by passing F2 over ice at 0°C, and removing
the product into a cold trap.

F, + H,0 === HOF + HF

HOF is unstable, and decomposes on its own to HF and Oy, It is a strong
oxidizing agent and oxidizes H2O to H2O> quite readily. The —OF group
occurs in F;C—OF, O;N—OF, Fs;S—OF and O;CI—OF and these are all
strong oxidizing agents. HOF should be a stronger acid than HOCI.

HOCI, HOBr and HOI are not very stable, and are known only in
aqueous solutions. They are very weak acids, but they are good oxidizing
agents especially in acidic solutions. They can be prepared by shaking the
halogen with freshly precipitated HgO in water, for example:

2HgO + H,O + 2Cl, + HgO-HgCh + 2HOCI

Hypochlorous acid is the most stable. Sodium hypochlorite NaOCl is
well known, and is used extensively for bleaching cotton fabric, and as
a domestic bleach (sold under various trade names: Parazone, Lanry,
Domestos, Chlorox etc.). It is also used as a disinfectant and steriliz-
ing agent. NaOCl is produced commercially by electrolysing cold brine
whilst stirring vigorously. During electrolysis hydrogen is liberated at
the cathode. This, increases the concentration of OH™ in the solution.
The stirring mixes the Cl, formed at the anode with the OH™ so they
can react together,
