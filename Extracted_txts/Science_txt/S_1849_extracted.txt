GROUP 17 - THE HALOGENS

 

H,O + Xz—» X; (hydrated)
HX + HOX

In a saturated solution of chlorine, about two thirds extts as hydrated
molecules, and the rest as hydrochloric and hypocblorous acids A mach
smaller amount of HOBr and a neghgible amount of HOI are formed by
ssmilae means
Dissolving the halogens in NaOH can in principle be used to make al
the hypohalite rons
Xq + 2NAOH + NaX + NsOX + H

However, the hypohainte tons tend to disproportionate, particularly in
baste solutions The rate of the disproportionation reaction increases with
temperature Thus when Ch dissolves in NaOH at or below room tem
perature, a reasonably pure solution of NaOCl and NaCl 1s obtained
However, sn hot solutions (80°C) the sodium hypochlorite dspropor
tuonates rapidly, and a good yield of sodium chlorate 1s obtained

Hypobromites can only be made at about O°C at temperatures above
50°C quantitative yields of BrOy are obtained

Hypoiodites disproportionate rapidly at all temperatures, and 10% 1s
produced quantitatwvely
‘Thus the hypohalites all tend to disproportionate The reduction poten

tuals show that OBr™ and OF” are unstable to dixproportionation, since
therr reduction potentials do not decrease progressively from oxidation
state (+V) to (41) t0 (0) However, the standard reduction potentials
suggest that OCI™ should just be stable under standard conditions

However, the values +1 65 volts and +1 61 volts are almost the same
‘These are standard potentials, measured under standard conditions
Differences from standard conditions of temperature and concentration
change the potentials suffictently for disproportionation to occur
