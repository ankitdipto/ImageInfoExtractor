LL
chlorine atom exists in the oxidation state (+I). HClO, is made by
treating barium chlorite with H,SO,, and filtering off the BaSOx.
Ba(CIO3)2 + H.SO, — 2HCIO2 + BaSOxs
Salts of HCIO; are called chlorites, and are made either from ClO and
sodium hydroxide, or CIO2 and sodium peroxide.

chlorite chlorate
2C1O, + Na,O. —> 2NaClO2 + Oz

Chlorites are used as bleaches. They are stable in alkaline solution even

when boiled, but in acid solution they disproportionate, particularly when

heated.

Halic acids HXO;

Three halic acids are known: HCIO;, HBrO; and HIO3. The halogen has
the oxidation state (+V). HCIO; and HBrO; are not very stable, but are
known in solution, and as salts. HCIO; and HBrO; detonate if attempts
are made to evaporate them to dryness. The main reaction is:

4HCIO, > 4Cl102(gas) + 2H2O(gas) + O2(gas)

In contrast, iodic acid HIO, is reasonably stable, and exists as a white
solid. The halic acids all behave as strong oxidizing agents and strong atids.

HIO; can be made by oxidizing 1, with concentrated, HNO; or O3.
HCIO; and HBrO, are made by treating the: barium halates with H2SO,,
and filtering off the BaSO,.

Ba(ClO3)2 + H,SO,— 2HCIO; + BaSO,
Chlorates may be made in two ways:
1. Passing Cl, into a hot solution of NaOH.
2. Electrolysing-hot chloride solutions that are vigorously stirred.

Only one sixth of the chlorine is converted to ClO; , which appears very

inefficient. However, the NaCl produced is electrolysed again, and is thus
Not wasted.

Chlorates and bromates decompose on heating, but the way they de-

pomPose is complex and is not fully understood. KCIO; may decompose
In two different ways, depending on the temperature.
