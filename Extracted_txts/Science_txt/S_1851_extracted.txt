(GROUP 17- THE HALOGENS

 

1 Heating KCIO to 400-500°C 1s the well known laboratory experiment
to produce dioxygen Tt also gives a trace of Cls or CIOs (though ths 5
seldom mentioned) Decomposition occurs at 150°C rf a catalyst suchas
‘MnO; oF powdered glass 1s present to provide a surface from whith O,
‘can escape

2KCIOy—+ 2KCI + 30;
When Za(CIO}s 1s heated 1¢ decomposes to Os and Cly
2Zn{CIOy)2 + ZnO + IC + 50;

2 Inthe absence of a catalyst especially at a lower temperature, KCIO,
tends to disproportionate to perchlorate and chlonde

4K CIO, — 3KCIO, + KCI

Chlorates are much more soluble than bromates and todates The
todates of Ce", Zr'*. HE" and Thi are precipitated from 6M HNO,
and this 162 useful means of separation for these metals

CChiorates are used to make fireworks and matches. Sodium chlorate
widely used asa powerful weedialler Its effects remain for some thes 2nd
Ht prevents growth for one growing season Solid chlorates, bromates and
todates should be handled with care Chlorates can explode on gts
‘on heating. oF sf they come nto contact with easily oxidized substants
Such as orgame matter or sulphur "They are particularly dangerous tte

tunteliable and dangerous

 

Pechalic acids HXO,

Perchlotie and pertodie acids and these salts are well known Perbv mats
were unknown until 1968 and are not common

World consumption of perchlorates 1s about 30000 tonnes pét Yee!
NaCO, 1s made by electrolysing aqueous NaCIOy using smooth pS
anodes ina steel container which also acts as the cathode The pum
electrode gives a high oxygen overpotential, and thus prevents te &e¢
