‘There are never more than two diferent halogens in a molecule The
‘bonds are essentially covalent because of the small electronegatmty
difference. and the melting and bosling points increase as the difference
electronegativty increases

“The compounds formed in the AX and AX: groups are those where the
electronegativty difference rs not too great The higher valencies AXs and
AX) are shown by large atoms such as Brand [associated with smal atoms
such as F This 1s because it 1s possible to pack more small atoms round 2
large one

‘The mterhalogens are generally more reactive than the halogens (except
F) This is because the AX bond in intethatogens ss weaker than the
XX bond im the halagens The reactions of mnterhatogens are slat to
those of the halogens Hydrolysis gives halide and oxohalde tons Note
that the oxohalide 1on 1 always formed from the larger halogen present

AX compounds
All sux compounds can be made by controlled reaction of the elements
CIF is very reactwe ICI and IBr are the most stable and can be obtained
pure at room temperature The compounds have properties intermediate
between those of the constituent halogens
CAF fuorinates many metals and non-metals
