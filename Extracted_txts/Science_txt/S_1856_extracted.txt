It can simultaneously chlorinate and fluorinate a compound either by
oxidizing the element or adding to a double bond.

Iodine monochloride ICI is well known. It is used as Wij's reagent in the
estimation of the iodine number of fats and oils. The iudine number is a
measure of the number of double bonds, i.e. the degree of unsaturation of
the fat. The ICI adds to double bonds in the fat. The ICI solution is brown
coloured, and when it is added to an unsaturated fat the colour disappears
until all the double bonds have reacted. The iodine number is simply the
volume (ml) of a standard solution of ICI which reacts with a fixed weight
of fat.

When ICI reacts with organic compounds it often iodinates them, though
chlorination may occur depending on the conditions.

It is thought that the attacking species is I*, since the I atoms substitute
in positions where there is an excess of electrons. Both ICI and IBr are
Partially ionized in the fused state. Conductivity measurements show that

ICI ionizes to the extent of about 1%. Rather than form the simple ions
I* and CI-, the ions are solvated. ‘

Both Icl and IBr can be used as non-aqueous ionizing solvents.
The interhalogens also form addition compounds with alkali halides.
These compounds are ionic, and are called polyhalides.
