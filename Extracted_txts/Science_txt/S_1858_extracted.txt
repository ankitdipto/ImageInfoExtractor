Bromine trifluoride BrF; is a red liquid. and can be made from the
elements at or near room temperature. It is manufactured in multi-tonne
quantities. It is less violent in its reactions than CIF3, but it reacts in an
analogous manner. The order of reactivity of the interhalogens is:

CIF, > BrFs > IF; > CIF > BrF; > IFs > BrF > IF; > IF

Like CIF;, BrF3 is used in nuclear processing and reprocessing to make
UF,, and it is used to make many other fluorides. It liberates dioxygen
quantitatively from many oxides (Bz03, SiOz, As2Os, 1205, CuO, TiO),
and also from oxosalts such as carbonates and phosphates. Measuring the
O; evolved is used as a method of analysis.

4BrF, + 3SiO2 — 3SiF,; + 2Br2 + 302
4BrF; + 3TiO > 3TiFs + 2Br, + 302
The interhalogens are all potential non-aqueous ionizing solvents. BrF,

has been more widely used as a solvent than the others. This is for three
main reasons:

1. It has a convenient liquid range (m.p. 8.8°C, b.p. 126°C).
2. It is a good, but not too violent, fluorinating agent.
3. It self-ionizes considerably, and much more than CIF3.

2BrF, = (BrF2]* + [BrF,]7

Thus substances producing [BrF2]* ions are acids and [BrF,4]~ ions are
bases in this solvent. .

The structure of the AX; type of interhalogen molecule is of interest. In
CIF3, Cl is the central atom (Figure 16.10).

Three unpaired electrons form bonds with
three fluorine atoms, plus two lone pairs,
giving a total of five electron pairs. Shape

occupied by lone pairs

The way to predict which of the three possible arrangements will be
formed is described in Chapter 4.

A structural study of CIF; by microwave spectroscopy shows that the
molecule is T-shaped, with bond angles of 87°40'. This is close to 90°, and
Suggests structure 3. The distortion from 90° is because of repulsion
between the lone Pairs. Note that two of the bond lengths are the same
and are different from the third. This is to be expected because a trigonal
bipyramid is not a regular shape. Equatorial bonds (those in the triangle)
are different from apical bonds (those pointing up and down). The X-ray
