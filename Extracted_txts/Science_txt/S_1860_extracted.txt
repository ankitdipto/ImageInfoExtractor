five unpaired electrons form bonds with
five fluorine atoms, plus one lone pair
giving a total of six electron pairs
structure is octahedral with one position
occupied by a lone pair (alternatively
described as square based pyramid)

Rather surprisingly, IF; reacts with the xenon halides, forming adducts
XeF,:2IF; and XeFy-IFs. «© + ° :

AX, compounds
IF; is formed by direct combination of the elements at 250-300°C, by
heating IF; with F2, or by treating iodides with F.
KI + 4F, > IF, + KF
Pdl, + 8F2 > 21F; + PdF2

IF, is a violent fluorinating agent, and reacts with most elements. It also
Teacts with water, SiO and CsF.

IF, + HO > IOF; + 2HF
2IF, + SiO» > 21OF; + SiF,
IF, + CsF > Cs*[IFg]~
The structure of IF; is unusual - a pentagonal bipyramid (Figure 16.13).

It is probably the only known example of a non-transition element using
three d orbitals for bonding.

POLYHALIDES

Halide ions often react with molecules of halogens or interhalogens and
pm Polyhalide ions. Iodine is only slightly soluble in water (0.34 g17').
ts solubility is greatly increased if some iodide ions are present in the
solution. The increase in solubility is due to the formation of a polyhalide

and in ionic crystals.
