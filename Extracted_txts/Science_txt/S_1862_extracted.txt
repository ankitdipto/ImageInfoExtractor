BASIC PROPERTIES OF THE HALOGENS

Elements typically become more metallic or basic on descending a main
group. Thus in Groups 14, 15 and 16 the first elements C, N and O are
nhon-metals, but the heavier members Sn, Pb, Bi and Po are metals.
Metallic properties decrease on crossing a period. Little is known about
astatine, though it would be expected to show more tendency to form
cations than the other members of the group. Thus the trend to metallic
Properties is less obvious in Group 17. The increasing stability of positive
ions indicates an increasing tendency to basic or metallic character. It must
be emphasized that iodine is not a metal.

Fluorine is the most electronegative element and has no basic properties
(that is. it has no tendency to form positive ions).

lodine dissolves in oleum and other strongly oxidizing solvents, forming
bright blue solutions which are paramagnetic. For a long time these solu-
tons were thought to contain I*, but they are now known to contain the
