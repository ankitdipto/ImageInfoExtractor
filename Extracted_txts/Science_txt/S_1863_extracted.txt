Positive bromine also exists in other complexes such as Br(pyridine);NOy

Complexes containing positive 1odine are more numerous ICI and IBr
both conduct electricity when molten Electrolysis of ICI iberates Iz and
ly at both electrodes This rs consistent with the following tonszation

BICI = [Cl] + {IC}
Molten ICN behaves in a similar way to IC)
BICN = [:CN]* + ((CN)2I- a melt

However, electrolysis of C1 dissolved in pyridine gives 1, only at the
cathode This suggests the more simple type of 1ontzation
