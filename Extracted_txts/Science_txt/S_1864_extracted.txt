ICI behaves as an electrophilic iodinating agent. It converts acetanilide
to 4-iodoacetanilide, and salicylic acid to 3.5-diiodosalicylic acid. Because
the attacked sites have an electron excess, the iodine must be positive.

If a solution of iodine in an inert solvent is passed down a cationic ion-
exchange column, some iodine is retained in the resin.

H*Resin™ + I, — I*Resin™ + HI

The.positive ion retained may be eluted with KI. to estimate the amount
of I", or it may be allowed to react with various reagents.

I*Resin™ + KI > I, + K*Resin7™
I‘Resin™ + anhydrous H.SO; > 1,SO, + H*Resin™
I*Resin~ + alcoholic HNO; — INO; + H*Resin™
1* reacts with OH™ in aqueous solutions. .
I* + OH” > HOI
2HOI + OL - Oy + 217 + 2H*

For this reason [* will only exist in water if it is stabilized by coordination
to some other molecule. A large number of compounds are known which
contain I* stabilized in a complex ion. Many pyridine complexes are
known such as [I(pyridine)2]NOs. [I(pyridine)2]CJO,. [I(pyridine) acetate
and {I(pyridine)]benzoate. .

Molten ICI; has a high conductivity (8.4 x 107*ohm~!cm7!). When
ICI, is electrolysed both I, and Cly are liberated at both electrodes. This
Suggests ionization:

2ICl, = [ICh]* + [1Cls]~

Treatment of 1, with fuming HNO; and acetic anhydride gives the ionic
compound I(acetate);. If a saturated solution of I(acetate), in acetic
anhydride is electrolysed using silver electrodes, one equivalent of Agl is
formed at the cathode for every three Faradays of electricity passed. This
would seem to indicate ionization giving P+:

I(acetate),; = P+ + 3(acetate™)

There is no structural evidence for the presence of I?*. Other ionic com-

pounds which may contain I°* are iodine phosphate IPO, and iodine
fluosulphonate I(SO3F);.

PSEUDOHALOGENS AND PSEUDOHALIDES

A few nts are known, consisting of two or more atoms of which at least

oes ‘net have Properties similar to those of the halide ions. They

sats may se salts tesembling the halide salts. For example, the sodium

pounds are acids like the halogen acids HX. Some of the pseudohalide
