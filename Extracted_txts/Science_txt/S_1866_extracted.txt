PROBLEMS
1. Describe how fluorine is produced, the apparatus used and any pre-

cautions you consider necessary. Is elemental fluorine widely used in
teactions?

1

- Why is it not possible to obtain F2 by electrolysis of aqueous NaF,
aqueous HF or anhydrous HF?

» What fluorinating agents are often used instead of F,? Give equations
to show their use.

~ What are the main uses of fluorine?

» Write balanced equations to show the reactions between HF and
(2) SiOz. (b) CaO. (c) KF. (d) CCl. (e) U, (£) graphite.
