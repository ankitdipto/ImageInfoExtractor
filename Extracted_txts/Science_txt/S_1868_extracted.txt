NAME OF GROUP AND THEIR ELECTRONIC STRUCTURES

The elements of Group 18 have been called ‘the inert gases’ and ‘the rare
gases’. Both are misnomers, since the discovery of the xenon fluorides in
1962 shows that xenon is not inert, and argon makes up 0.9% by volume

" of the atmosphere. The name ‘noble gases’ implies that they tend to be
unreactive, in the same way that the noble metals are often reluctant to
react and are the least reactive metals.

Helium has two electrons which form a complete shell 1s*. The other
noble gases have a closed octet of electrons in their outer shell ns*np®. This
electronic configuration is very stable and is related to their chemical
inactivity. These atoms have an electron affinity of zero (or slightly nega-
tive), and have very high ionization energies — higher than any other
elements. Under normal conditions the noble gas atoms have little ten-
dency to gain or lose electrons. Thus they have little tendency to form
bonds. and so they exist as single atoms.

 

OCCURRENCE AND RECOVERY OF THE ELEMENTS

The gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe all occur in the atmosphere. A mixture
of the noble gases was first obtained by Cavendish in 1784. Cavendish
removed N2 from air by adding excess O, and sparking. The NO2 formed
was absorbed in NaOH solution. The excess O2 was removed by burning
