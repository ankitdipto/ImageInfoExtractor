GROUP 18 THE NOBLE GASES

 

 

with S, and absorbing the SO; 1m NOH solution ‘This gave a small volume
of unreactive gas

‘Ars quite abundant and can be recovered by fractional distillation of
Inquid ase (See under ‘Nitrogen’, Chapter 14) Ar constitutes 0 93% by
volume of air (1 9300ppm) It ongmates inthe arr mostly from electron
capture (B+ decay) of potassium

RK + fe Bar

World production of Ar 1s over 700000 tonnes/year

“The other noble gases are much less abundant The abundance of He in
the atmosphere 1s only about Sppm by volume and recovery ftom air
‘would be very expensive A cheaper source 1s from natural gas deposts,
‘where the hydrocarbons are hquifed. leaving He gas. The He has been
produced by radioactive decay and trapped underground The richest
source 1s in southwest USA. where the natural gas contains 0 50 8% He
“This provides mos ofthe world’s supply of He Other natural gas deposits
containing appreciable amounts of He have been found in Algeria, Poland,
the USSR and Canada World production was 18800 tonnes in 1993

‘The non-radioactive noble gases are all produced industrially by fre
tronal distillation of liquid xr This grves large amounts of distrogen and
droxygen, and only a small amount of the noble gases (The dioxygen
manly used for steel making } Of the noble gases, Ar ss obtamed in the
Jargest amounts, and st 1s the cheapest

Rn is radyoactve and 1s produced by the decay of radium and thonum
minerals A convenient source 1s Ra, and 100g of radium yields about
2m of radon per day

 

 

 

FRRa “Rn + tHe

‘The most stable sotope Rn 1s tse @ active and has a half hfe of only 3
days. so only tracer studies have been made

USES OF THE ELEMENTS

‘The largest use of Ar to provide an inert atmosphere for metallrgcl
processes This inches welding stamless sec! ttamom, magnesium and
slumntur and inthe production of tau (Kroll. and IM processes)
Smalfer amounts are used sn growing sthcon and germanium crystals fr
transistors, and in elect lightbulbs fucrescent lamps, radi valves and
Geiger~Moller radiation counters

Helium has the lowest boring point of any hquud and 1 1 used #0
eryostopy to obtain the very low temperatures requited for superconduc
tivity. snd lasers. Its used as the cooling gas in one type of gos cooled
rclear reactor. and asthe flow gas in easshgord chromatography i
saiko used in weather balloons and aurships Though Hy has a lower dens
finds cheaper and more readily svanabe than He, Hes highly fammable
‘Thus on safety grounds He is used i preference to He in airships He 1
