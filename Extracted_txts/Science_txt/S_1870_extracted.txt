pressure can lift 1kg. Helium is used in preference to dinitrogen to dilute
dioxygen in the gas cylinders used by divers. This is because dinitrogen is
quite soluble in blood, so a sudden change in pressure causes degassing
and gives bubbles of N> in the blood. This causes the painful (or fatal)
condition called ‘bends’. Helium is only slightly soluble so the risk of
‘bends’ is reduced.

Small amounts of Ne are used in neon discharge tubes which give the
familiar reddish orange glow of ‘neon’ signs. The other gases are also used
in discharge tubes to give different colours.

 

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

The elements are all colourless, odourless monatomic gases. The enthalpy
of vaporization is a measure of the forces holding the atoms together. The
values are very low because the only forces between the atoms are very
weak van der Waals forces. The enthalpy of vaporization increases down
the group as the polarizability of the atoms increases.

Because the interatomic forces are very weak, the melting points and
boiling points are also very low. The boiling point of He is the lowest of
any clement. only four degrees above absolute zero.

The atomic radii of the elements are all very large, and increase on
descending the group. It must be noted that these are non-bonded radii,
and should be compared with the van der Waals radii of other elements
rather than with covalent (bonded) radii.

The noble gases are all able to diffuse through glass, rubber and plastic
materials, and some’ metals. This makes them difficult to handle in the

laboratory, particularly since glass Dewar flasks cannot be used for low
temperature work. 7
