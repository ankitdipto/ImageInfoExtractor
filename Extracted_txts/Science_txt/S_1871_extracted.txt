pheres) There are two diferent iqund phases Hehwum Isa normal hquid,
but helium Iss asuperfurd_ A superfluid sa most unuswa sate of matter
‘Normally atoms are free to move ina gas, ean move ma mote resncted
way ina liquid, and can only vibrate about fixed positions ina solid As the
temperature decreases, the amount of thermal motion of atoms decreases,
and gases become hquids, and eventually solids. When the temperature of
hnelum gas 1s Jonered to 42K 11 iguifies as helium 1 Rather surprisingly
the liquid continues to bon vigorously At2 2K, the guid suddenly stops
bowing (winch with normal matenalss when a sohd 1s formed) In thisease
hrelum itis formed This 1s still a hquid because the mteratomuc forces are
not strong enough to form a sohd, but thermal motion of the atoms has
actually stopped Helum 1 1s a normal liquid and when it changes to
hhehum If at the 2-pomnt temperature, many physical properties change
abruptly The specific heat changes by a factor of 10 ‘The thermal conduc-
tuvity mereases by 10° and becomes 800 times greater than for copper It
becomes a superconductor (ve shows zero electrical resistance) The
viscosity becomes effectively zero and 1/100th ofthat of gaseous hydrogen
It spreads to cover all surfaces at temperatures below the 2-point Thus the
Iiguad can actualy flow up the sides of the sessel and over the edge until the
levels on both sides are the same The surface tension and compressibity
are also anomalous

 

 

(CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NOBLE GASES

‘The noble gases were ssolated and discovered because of their lack of
reactivity For a long time 1t was thought that they really were chemically
inert Before 1962, the only evidence for compound formation by the
noble gases was some molecular tons formed in discharge tubes, and
clathrate compounds

‘Molecular sons formed under exented conditions

‘Several molecular 1ons such as He?. HeH”, HeH"* and Arf are formed
under high energy conditions in discharge tubes ‘They only sursive mo

mentanly and are detected spectroseopically Neutral molecules such as
Hez are unstable

 

(Clathrate compounds

Clathrate compounds of the noble gases are well known Normal chemical
compounds have tome or covalent bonds However. in the clathrates
atoms or molecules of the appropriate size are trapped in cavities in the
crystal latuce of other compounds Though the gazes are trapped, they 40
not form bonds

fan aqueous solition of quinol (1.4 dihydroxybenzene) 1s crystallized
under a pressure of 10-40 atmospheres of At. Kr or Xe, the gas becomes
trapped sn cavities of about 4A diameter inthe -quinol structure When
