the clathrate is dissolved, the hydrogen bonded arrangement of B-quinol
breaks down and the noble gas escapes. Other small molecules such as O2,
S03, H,S. MeCN and CH30H form clathrates as well as Ar. Kr and Xe.
The smaller noble gases He and Ne do not form clathrate compounds
because the gas atoms are small enough to escape from the cavities. The
composition of these clathrate compounds corresponds to 3 quinol:1
trapped molecule, though normally all the cavities are not filled

The gases Ar. Kr and Xe may be trapped in cavities in a similar way
when water is frozen under a high pressure of the gas. These are clathrate
compounds, but are more commonly called ‘the noble gas hydrates’. They
have formulae approximating to 6H,O:1 gas atom. He and Ne are not
trapped because they are too small. The heavier noble gases can also be
trapped in cavities in synthetic zeolites, and samples have been obtained
containing up to 20% of Ar by weight. Clathrates provide-a convenient
means of storing radioactive isotopes of Kr and Xe produced in nuclear
reactors.

CHEMISTRY OF XENON

The first real compound of the noble gases was made in 1962. Bartlett and
Lohman had previously used the highly oxidizing compound platinum
hexafluoride to oxidize dioxygen.

PIF, + Op > OF [PtF,]7

The first ionization energy for 0, > OF is 1165 kJ mol~', which is almost
the same as the value of 1170kJ mol”! for Xe > Xe”. It was predicted

that xenon should react with PtF,. Experiments showed that when deep’

ted PUR, vapour was mixed with an equal voliime of Xe, the gases com-
bined immediately at room temperature to produce a yellow solid. They
(incorrectly) thought the product obtained was xenon hexafluoropla-
Uinate(V), Xe*[PtFe]”. The reaction has since been shown to be more
complicated, and the product is really [XeF]*[PtoF).]7

25°C . eat 60"
Xe[PtF] + PtFh—S [XeF]*[PtR]” + PUFs 2S [XeF]* [PF 7

Soon after this it was found that Xe and F, reacted at 400°C to give
a colourless volatile solid XeF,.-This has the same number of valency
electrons as, and is isostructural with, the polyhalide ion (ICI,]~. Follow-
ing these discoveries there was a rapid extension of the chemistry of the
noble gases, and in particular of xenon.

Re pdivenies energies of He, Ne and Ar are much higher than for Xe,

ination es "gh to allow the formation of similar compounds. The ion-

The ‘one for Kris a little lower than for Xe, and Kr does form KrF3.

tofom a energy of Rn is less than for Xe, and Rn might be expected

isotopes ar similar to those of Xe. Rn is radioactive, has no stable

on eee and all the isotopes have short half lives. This has limited work
n compounds, and only RnF; and a few complexes are known.
