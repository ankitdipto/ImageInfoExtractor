Xe reacts directly only with F: However. oxygen compounds can be
‘obtained from the fluorides There 1s some evidence for the existence of
XeCl; and XeCl, and one compound is known with a Xe—N bond. Thus
there is quite an extensive chemsity of Xe The principal compounds are
Usted n Table 173

Xenon reacts directly with fluorine when the gases are heated at 400°C
1m a sealed nickel vessel and the products depend on the Fy/Xe ratio

sublimed at room temperature, and ean be stored indefimtely in nickel ot
Monel containers The lower fluorides form higher fluorides when heated
with F; under pressure The fluorides ate all extsemely strong oxdizing
and fluorinating agents They react quantuawvely with hydrogen 35
