XeF, + 2H, > 4HF + Xe
XeF, + 3H2 > 6HF + Xe
They oxidize CI” to Clz, I~ to I, and cerium(III) to cerium(IV):
XeF, + 2HCI > 2HF + Xe + Cl,
XeF, + 4KI— 4KF + Xe + 21,
$03- + XeF) + Cel!"(SO4)3 > 2Ce!Y(SOx)2 + Xe + Fp

They fluorinate compounds:
XeF, + 2SFy—> Xe + 2SFo
XeFy + Pt» Xe + PtF,
XeF, is now commercially available and is quite widely used in synthetic
organic chemistry. It can oxidize and fluorinate the ‘hetero element’ in an
organometallic compound, but does not attack the alkyl or aryl groups.
CHI + XeF, > CH3IF, + Xe
CoHs] + XeF, > CoHsIF2 + Xe
(CeHs)28 + XeF, > (CgHs)2SF2 + Xe
If XeF, is mixed with anhydrous HF its reactivity is greatly increased,
possibly due to the formation of XeF*.
Pt + 3XeF/HF — PtF, + 3Xe
Sg + 24XeF,/HF — 8SF, + 24Xe
CrF, + XeF,/HF — CrF; + Xe CrFy + Xe
MoO; + 3XeF2/HF > MoF, + 3Xe + 140,
Mo(CO), + 3XeF2/HF > MoF, + 3Xe + 6CO

The fluorides differ in their reactivity with water. XeF is soluble in water,
but undergoes slow hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is more rapid with alkali.

2XeF, + 2H,0 > 2Xe + 4HF + O2

XeF; reacts violently with water, giving xenon trioxide XeO3.
3XeF, + 6H,O > 2Xe + XeO3 + 12HF + 150,
XeF, also Teacts violently with water, but slow hydrolysis by atmospheric
moisture gives the highly explosive solid XeO3.
XeF, + 6H,0 — XeO, + 6HF

With small quantities of water, partial hydrolysis occurs, giving a colour-

less liquid xenon oxofluoride XeOF,. The same product is formed when
XeF, reacts with silica or glass:

XeF, + H,O > XeOF, + 2HF
2XeFe + SiO,» XeOF, + SIF,
