Several perxenates of Group 1 and 2 metals have been wsolated, and the
exystal structures of Na,XeOn 6H,O and NasXeO, 8H30 have been
determined by X ray crystallography The solubility of sodium perxenate
mn OSM NaOH 1s only 02 grams per Ite. so precipitation of sodium
pernenate could be used as a gravimetsc method of analysis for sodium
Persenates are extremely powerful oxtduzing agents, which will oxudze
HCI to Cl, HO to On, and Mn? to MnOx With concentrated HyS0,
they give xenon tetroxide XeOs, which 1s volatile and exploswwe

NOF5, TaFs, RuF, OsF, RhFs,ItFy and PtFy. These are thought to have
