2XeF,-MFs — [Xe2F3]* [MFo]}~

The structures of some of the XeF, complexes in the solid state are known.
In the complex XeF-2SbF; (Figure 17.1) the two Xe-F distances dif-
fer greatly (184A and 2.35A). This suggests the formulation [XeF]*
[Sb.F,,]”. However, the Xe-F distance of 2.35 A is much less than the
van der Waals (non-bonded) distance of 3.50A. This suggests that one
fluorine atom forms a fluorine bridge between Xe and Sb. In fact the
structure is intermediate between that expected for the ionic structure,
and that for the fully covalent bridge structure.

XeF, forms only a few complexes, for example those with PFs, AsFs and
SbF. XeF, can act as a fluoride donor, forming complexes such as:

XeF,- BF;
XeFe: GeF,
XeF,- 2GeFy
XeF,- 4SnF,
XeF,- AsFs
XeF,,- SbF;

XeF, may also act as a fluoride acceptor. With RbF and CsF it reacts as
follows:

XeF, + RDF > Rb*[XeF,]~
On heating, the [XeF,]~ ion decomposes:

2Cs*[XeF;]-—S XeF, + Cso[XeFu]

STRUCTURE AND BONDING IN XENON COMPOUNDS

The structures of the more common xenon halides, oxides and oxoions are
given in Table 17.4 (on page 647). The nature of the bonds and the
orbitals used for bonding in these compounds are of great interest and
have been the subject of considerable controversy.

XeF,

XeF is a linear molecule with both Xe—F distances 2.00A. The bonding Xe
may be explained quite simply by promoting an electron from the Sp level
of Xe to the Sd level. The two unpaired electrons form bonds with fluorine
atoms. The five electron pairs point to the corners of a trigonal bipyramid.
Of these, three are lone pairs and occupy the equatorial positions, and two
are bond pairs and occupy the apical positions. The atoms thus form a é
linear molecule (Figure 17.2). Figure 17.2 XeF, molecule.
