‘A second objection ts over the mixing of orbitals (5p%d hybridization)
Mining is only effective between orbitals of similar energy, andthe Xe Sd
orbtals would seem too high st energy to contribute to such a scheme of

‘Assume that bonding involves the Sp, orbital of Xe and the 2p, orbitals of
the two F atoms For bondmg to occur, orbitals with the same symmetry
‘must overlap These three atomic orbitals combine to give three molecular
‘orbitals, one bonding, one non-bonding and one anhibonding Thr 3s
represented in a simple way i Figure 173 The onginal three atomic
orbitals contained four electrons (two in the Xe Sp, and one mn each of
the F 2p,)yThese electrons will occupy the molecular orbitals of lowest
‘energy ‘The order of energy 1s

bonding MO <non-bonding MO < antibonding MO

‘Thus two electrons occupy the bonding MO. and this pair of electrons
responsible for binding all three atoms The remaining two electrons
‘occupy the non bonding MO These electrons are situated mainly on the
F atoms, and confer some 1onie character ‘The bonding may be deseribed
as three centre. four electron ¢ bonding A finear arrangement of the
toms gies the best overlap of orbitals, in agreement with the observed
structure These bonds should be compared wath the three-centie {o>
