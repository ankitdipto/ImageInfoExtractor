F Xe F _Antibonding (orbitals have
wrong symmetry for overlap
on both left and right

hand sides, indicated by

+ and — signs)

 

Non-bonding (the Xe 5p orbital
has no net contribution to
bonding, since the bonding
effect on the right hand side is
cancelled by the antibonding
effect on the left hand side)

Bonding (orbitals on both the
left and right hand sides have
correct symmetry for overlap)

XeF,

The structure of XeF, is square planar, with Xe-F distances of 1.95A.

ve valence bond theory explains this by promoting two electrons as
shown:

Electronic structure of
Xe — excited state

four unpaired electrons form bonds to four fluorine atoms
six electron pairs form octahedral structure
with two positions occupied by fone pairs
