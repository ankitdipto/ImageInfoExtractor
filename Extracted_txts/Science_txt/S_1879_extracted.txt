Figure 17.5 XeF molecule

‘The problem of whether the size of the xenon Sd orbitals wilt allow effec
tive overlap or their energy will allow mixing and hybrdreation, 1s the
same as in XeF: The molecular orbital explanation of XeF 1s simular to
that for XeF; The Xe atom bonds to four F atoms ‘The xenon Sp, orbial
forms a three centre MO with 2p orbitals from two F atoms just as in
XeFs The 5p, orbital forms another three centre MO involving two more
F atoms ‘The two three centre orbrtals are at right angles to each other,
thus gwing a square planar molecule
