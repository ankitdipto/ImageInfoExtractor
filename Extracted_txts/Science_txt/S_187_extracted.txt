Chlorophylls and Carotenoids

Chlorophylls absorb photons by means of an excitation
process analogous to the photoelectric effect. These pigments
contain a complex ring structure, called a porphyrin ring,
with alternating single and double bonds. At the center of the
ring is a magnesium atom. Photons absorbed by the pigment
molecule excite electrons in the ring, which are then chan-
neled away through the alternating carbon-bond system. Sev-
eral small side groups attached to the outside of the ring alter
the absorption properties of the molecule in different kinds of
chlorophyll (figure 10.6). The precise absorption spectrum is
also influenced by the local microenvironment created by the
association of chlorophyll with specific proteins.

Once Ingenhousz demonstrated that only the green parts
of plants can “restore” air, researchers suspected chlorophyll
was the primary pigment that plants employ to absorb light
in photosynthesis. Experiments conducted in the 1800s
clearly verified this suspicion. One such experiment, per-
formed by T. W. Englemann in 1882 (figure 10.7), serves as
a particularly elegant example, simple in design and clear in
outcome. Englemann set out to characterize the action
spectrum of photosynthesis, that is, the relative effective-
ness of different wavelengths of light in promoting photo-
synthesis. He carried out the entire experiment utilizing a
single slide mounted on a microscope. To obtain different

wavelengths of light, he placed a prism under his micro-
scope, splitting the light that illuminated the slide into a
spectrum of colors. He then arranged a filament of green
algal cells across the spectrum, so that different parts of the
filament were illuminated with different wavelengths, and
allowed the algae to carry out photosynthesis. To assess
how fast photosynthesis was proceeding, Englemann chose
to monitor the rate of oxygen production. Lacking a mass
spectrometer and other modern instruments, he added
aerotactic (oxygen-secking) bacteria to the slide; he knew
they would gather along the filament at locations where
oxygen was being produced. He found that the bacteria ac-
cumulated in areas illuminated by red and violet light, the
two colors most strongly absorbed by chlorophyll.

All plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll a as
their primary pigments. It is reasonable to ask why these
photosynthetic organisms do not use a pigment like retinal
(the pigment in our eyes), which has a broad absorption
spectrum that covers the range of 500 to 600 nanometers.
The most likely hypothesis involves photoefficiency. Al-
though retinal absorbs a broad range of wavelengths, it
does so with relatively low efficiency. Chlorophyll, in con-
trast, absorbs in only two narrow bands, but does so with
high efficiency. Therefore, plants and most other photo-
synthetic organisms achieve far higher overall photon cap-
ture rates with chlorophyll than with other pigments.
