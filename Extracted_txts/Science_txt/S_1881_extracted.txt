Fogure 17.7 Structures of some xenon compounds

‘The dhecovery of the nobié gas compounds led to a furry of practeat
work attempting the synthesis of new compounds ‘There was also much
‘heosetical work attempting to explain the structure and bonding in these
compounds This involved ealculations on large computers on the extent
of d orbital parwerpation im bonding by elements in the 5- and p blocks
“These conclusions may be summarrzed 38 follows

1 tn compounds of high coordination number with elements of high
clectronegatity, such as PF, SF. IF and XeF, the d orbitals appear
to be significantly involved in & bonding, (These compounds may all be
described without using d orbitals if theee-centre bonds are formed )

2. In compounds wit elements of low electronegatsuty such as HS and
PH. the d orbital population is very low (1-2%) However. this
small contribution conswerably umproves the sgreement between
the observed and calevlated values for the dipole maments aad the
energy levels

3 ‘The use of d orbitals makes a very significant contribution to x bands
for example pr=dx bonding m the phosphates and oxoseids of sulphur.
and in PE
