PROBLEMS

1, Where did the helium present in the earth arid its atmosphere come
from? How is He obtained commercially, and what is it used for? What
is the boiling point of He in Â°C and K?

. How much argon is present in the earth's atmosphere? How is Ar
obtained commercially, and what is it used for?

. Explain why Ar is used in the Kroll process to extract Ti, for welding,
and in electric light bulbs.

(a) Draw the structures of XeF2, XeF, and XeF,.
(b) How may these compounds be prepared from Xe?

(c) Give balanced equations to show how these three compounds react
With water.

How did Bartlett interpret the reaction between Xe and PtF,, and how
is this reaction now interpreted?
5. (a) Draw

the structures of XeF,
me eF2, XeF, and XeF,.

may these compounds be prepared from Xe?
