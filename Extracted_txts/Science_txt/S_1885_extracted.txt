Three series of elements are formed by filling the 3d, 4d and Sd shells of
electrons. Together these comprise the d-block elements. They are often
called ‘transition elements’ because their position in the periodic table is
between the s-block and p-block elements. Their properties are transi-
tional between the highly reactive metallic elements of the s-block, which
typically form ionic compounds, and the elements of the p-block, which are
largely covalent. In the s- and p-blocks, electrons are added to the outer
shell of the atom. In the d-block, electrons are added to the penultimate

shell, expandin;
