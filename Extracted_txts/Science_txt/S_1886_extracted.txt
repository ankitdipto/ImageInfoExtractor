654 ‘AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS 4

METALLIC CHARACTER

In the d block elements the penultimate shell of electrons 1s expanding
“Thus they have many physical and chemical properties in common Thus
all the transition elements are metals They are therefore good conductors
of electricity and heat, have a metallic lustre and are hard, strong and
ucule They slso form alloys with other metals

VARIABLE OXIDATION STATE

One of the most striking features of the transition elements thatthe
elements usually exis sn several different oxidation states. Furthermore,
‘the oxidation states change m units of one, ¢ g Fe™* and Fe™*, Cu? and
a

“The oxidation states shown by the transition elements may be related to
their electronue structures Calcium, the s-block element preceding the fst
row of transition elements, hes the electronic steueture

It might be expected that the next ten transition elements would have ths
electron arrangement with from one to ten d electrons added in a regular
way 3d, 3d°,3d? 3d! Thusas teue except in the cases of Crand Cu In
these two cases one ofthe s electrons moves nto the d shell, because ofthe

additional stability when the d orbitals are exactly half filled or completely
filled (Table 18 2)

GH) when two s and one d electrons are used and (+1V) when two s and
two d electrons ate used Sioutarly, V shows oxidation numbers (+1,
(4M), (FIV) and GV) In the case of Cr, by using the single 5 electron
for bonding, we get an oxidation number of (+1) hence by using Varying
