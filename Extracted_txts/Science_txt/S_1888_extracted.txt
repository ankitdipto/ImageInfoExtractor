‘AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS —

configuration and Pa(Il) and Au(IIt) have d* configurations, that 1s they
have an incompletely filled d level, However, 1m zine, cadmum and
mercury the 1ons Zn®* , Ca"* and Hig’* have a di configuration Because
of this, these elements do not show the properties characterise of
‘transition elements

 

‘Stabitny ofthe vanous oxidation states

Compounds ate regarded as stable if they extst at room temperature, are
not oxidized by the air, are not hydrolysed by water vapour and 6 not
disproportionate or decompose at normal temperatures Within each of
the transition Groups 312, there ssa difference in stabihty of the various
oxidation states that exist In general the second and third row elements
exhubit higher coordination numbers, and ther hygher oxidation states are
‘more stable than the corresponding first sow elements. This can be seen
fom Table 18 3. This gives the known oxwes and halides of the fist,
second and third row transition elements Stable oxidation states form
