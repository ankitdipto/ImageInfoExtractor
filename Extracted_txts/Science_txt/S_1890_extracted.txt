Thus ability to forsn complexes 1s in marked contrast to the s and p-block
clernents which form only a few complexes The reason transition elements
are so good at forming complexes 1s that they have small, highly charged
tons and have vacant low energy orbitals to accept lone pasts of electrons

‘Some metal ions form their mast stable complexes with ligand in which
‘the donor atoms are N. O or F Such metal ions include Group 1 and 2
