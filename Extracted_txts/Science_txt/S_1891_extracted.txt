elements of Groups 15. 16'and 17. These metals are called class-b ac-
ceptors, and correspond to“‘soft’ acids. The rest of the transition metals,
and the heaviest elements in the p-block, form complexes with both types
of donors, and are thus ‘intermediate’ in nature. These are shown (a/b) in

Table 18.4.

The nature of coordination complexes and the important crystal field
theory of bonding are discussed in Chapter 7.

SIZE OF ATOMS AND IONS

The covalent radii of the elements (Table 18.5) decrease from left to right
across a row in the transition series, until near the end when the size
increases slightly. On passing from left to right, extra protons are placed in
the nucleus and extra orbital electrons are added. The orbital electrons
shield the nuclear charge incompletely (d electrons shield less efficiently
than p electrons, which in turn shield less effectively than s electrons).
Because of this poor screening by d electrons, the nuclear charge attracts
all of the electrons more strongly: hence a contraction in size occurs.
Atoms of the transition elements are smaller than those of the Group 1
or 2 elements in the same horizontal period. ‘This is partly because of the
usual contraction in size across a horizontal period discussed above, and
