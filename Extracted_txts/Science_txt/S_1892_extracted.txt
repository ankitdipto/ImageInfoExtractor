partly because the orbital electrons are aded to the penultimate d shell
rather than to the outer shell of the atom

‘The transition elements are divided into vertical groups of three (teas)
for sometimes four elements, which have sumilar electronte structures On
descending one of the main groups of elements in the s- and p-blocks. the
size of the atoms increases because extra shells of electrons are present
‘The elements n the first group sm the d block (Group 3) show the expected
ierease in size Se—» Y ~ La. However, in the subsequent Groups (3-12)
there s an merease 1n radius of O 1 + 0 2A between the first and second
member but hardly any increase between the second and thurd elements
Tixs trend ts shown both in the covalent radi (Table 18 5) and 1a the vonte
radu (Table 18 6) Interposed between lanthanum and hafaium are the I$
fanthamide elements. in which the antepenultrmate 4f shell of electrons is

‘There 1s a gradual decrease in swe of the 14 lanthanide elements from
‘cerium to lutetium This 1s called the lanthanide contraction, and 15 a's
cussed yn Chapter 29 ‘The fanthamie contraction cancels almost exactly
the normal sze increase on descending a group of transition elements The
covalent radius of Hf and the yoruc rads of HU* ate actually smalter than
the corresponding values for Zr The covalent and ronic radu of Nb are the
same as the values for Ta Therefore the second and third row transition
elements have similar radu As a result they also have simular lattice
cenergles solvation energies and 1onvzation enereies Thus the differences
1m properties between the first row and second row elements afe much
greater than the differences between the second and third row elements
‘The effects af the tanthamde contraction ate fess pronounced towards the
right of the d block However the effect sull shows toa lesser degree mn the
p block elements which follow
