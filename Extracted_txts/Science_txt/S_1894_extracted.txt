"AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS

 

 

‘These are comparable with the values for Inthium and carbon respectnely
‘This would suggest that the transmion elements are less electropositive than
Groups 1 and 2 and mas form either tonic oF covalent bonds depending
fon the conditions Generally, the lower valent states are ronte and the
higher valent states covalent’ The first row elements have many more
sonie compounds than elements in the second and third rows

‘COLOUR,

Many 1onte and covalent compounds of transition elements are coloured
In contrast compounds of the s- and p-block elements are almost always
‘white When light passes through a material 11s deprived of those wave-
Fengths that are absorbed If absorption occurs in the visible region of the
spectrum, the transmatted light s coloured with the complementary colout
to the colour of the light absorbed Absorption in the visible and UV
regions of the spectrum is caused by changes m electronic energy Thus the
spectra are sometimes called electronic spectra (These changes are often
accompanied by much smaller changes in vibrational and rotational
‘energy ) Its always possible to promote an electron from one energy level
to another However, the enerey jumps are usually so large that the
absorption les an the UV region Special exrcumstances ean make tt
possible to obtain small jumps in electronic energy which appear 2s
absorption in the visible region
