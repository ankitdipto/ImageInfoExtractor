Diamagnette materials tend to repel lines of force Itis harder for magnetic
Ines of force to travel through diamagnetic materials than through a
‘vacuum, and such matenals tend to move from a stronger toa weaker part
‘of a magnetic field In diamagnetic compounds all the electron spins are
pared The paramagnetic effects much larger than the diamagnetic effet

Itshould be noted that Fe, Co and Nr are ferromagnetic Ferromagnetic
materials may be regarded as a special case of paramagnetism in which the
moments on individual atoms become aligned and all point in the same
direction When this happens the magnetic susceptibility 1 greatly
enhanced compared with what 1t would be if all the moments behaved
independently Alignment occurs when materials are magnetized, and Fe,
Co and Ni can form permanent magnets Ferromagnetsm 1s found i
several of the transition metals and their compounds It 1s also possible to
{get antiferromagnetism by pairing the moments on adyacent atoms which
point m opposite dizections Tins pes a magnetie moment less than would
bie expected for an array of independent rons [t occurs in several simple
salts of Fe* Mn?* and Gd?* Since ferromagnetism and antiferro
magnetism depend on orientation they disappear in solution

Many compounds of the transition elements are paramagnetic, because
they contain partially filled electron shells If the magnetic moment 1s
measured the number of unpatred electrons can be calculated The
‘magnetochemstry of the transition elements shows whethar the electrons
are pated This 1s of great importance in distinguishing between high spit
and fow spin octahedral complexes

There are two common methods of measuring magnetic susceptibilities
the Faraday and the Gouy methods The Faraday method 1s useful for
measurements on a vecy small single crystal but there are practical
Aifculties because the forces are very small The Gouy method 1s more
often used Here the sample may be presented asa long rod of matersal +
solution or a glass tube packed with powder One end of the sample
placed sn a uniform magnetic field and the other end ina very tow 0; zero
field The forces observed here are much larger. and can be measured
using a modshed Inboratory balance

‘The volume susceptibility x; of a compound is measured using 4
magnetic balance (Gouy balance) nj 1 dimensionless and 1s readily
‘converted into the molar susceptibility x44, which has umnts m’ mo!~* From
this the magnetic moment of the compound j. can be calculated if the
small diamagnetic contribution 18 ignored
