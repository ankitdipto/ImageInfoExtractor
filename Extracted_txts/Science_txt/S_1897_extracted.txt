where e is the electronic charge, h is Planck's constant and m, is the mass

of an electron. .
Thus the magnetic moment in Bohr magnetons becomes.

The magnetic moment p of a transition metal can give important
information about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom
and the orbitals that are occupied, and sometimes indicates the structure of
the molecule or complex. If the magnetic moment is due entirely to the
spin of unpaired electrons ps, then

tts = Y4S(S + 1). Up
