paramagnetic materials varied with temperature. He put forward the Curie
law that the paramagnetic susceptibility xm varies inversely with the
absolute temperature, and

iM =F

where C is a constant characteristic for the particular substance, called the
Curie constant. Thus the magnetic field tends to align the moments of the
paramagnetic atoms or ions, and thermal agitation tends to randomize
them. Applying a statistical treatment:

Thus the magnetic moment in Bohr magnetons is given by:

The Curie law is obeyed with great accuracy by some systems such as

[FeF,]>- However, many paramagnetic materials deviate slightly from

this ideal behaviour, and obey the Curie-Weiss law:

CATALYTIC PROPERTIES

Many transition metals and their compounds have catalytic properties.
Some of the more important ones are listed here:

TiCl; Used as the Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the production of
polythene.

V205 Converts SO3 to SO, in the Contact process for making
H2SO,.

MnO, Used as a catalyst to decompose KCIO; to give Oo.

Fe Promoted iron is used in the Haber—Bosch process for
making NH3.

FeCl, Used in the production of CCl; from CS, and Cl.

FeSO, “

and H30, Used as Fenton’s reagent for oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes.

PdCly Wacker process for converting C2H, + H20 + PdCh to

Pa CH3CHO + 2HCI + Pd.

Used for hydrogenation (e.g. phenol to cyclohexanone).
PuPtO. Adams catalyst, used for reductions.
