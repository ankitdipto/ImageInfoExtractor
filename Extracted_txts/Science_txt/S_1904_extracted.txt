"AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS

 

Pt Formerly used for $0; ~+ $0 1n the Contact process for
making HoSOx

rt Is ineteasingly beimg used m three stage convertors for
cleaning car exhaust fumes

PuRh Formerly used in the Ostwald process for making HNOs 10
oxidize NH, to NO

cu Is used in the dicect process for manufacture of (CHy),SiC2
used to make sihcones

Cul Oxidation of cyclohexanoV/eyelohexanone muxtures to adipic

seid which is used to make nylon 66

CuCh, Deacon process of making Cl from HCl

N Raney nickel numerous reduction processes (eg man
facture of hexametlylenediamine production of Hy {fom
NH) reducing anthraquinone to anthraquinol inthe produc
tion of HOs)

N Reppe synthesis (polymervation of alkynes eg to jive

complexes benzene or cyclooctatetraene)

In some eases the transition metals with their variable valency may form

tunstable intermediate compounds In other cases the transition metal

provides a sutable reaction surface

Enaymes are ewtalysts that enhance the rates of specific reactions They

are proteins and are produced by living cells from amino acids They work

Lunder mild conditions often give 100% yields and may speed a reactio# by

10° or 10!? mes Some enzymes requite the presence of metal ron aS

cofactors and these are called metalloenzymes Many (but not all) mello

enzymes contain a transition metal Some metalloenzymes are listed 1"
