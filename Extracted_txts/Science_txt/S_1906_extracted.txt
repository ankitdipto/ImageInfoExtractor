DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST ROW AND THE OTHER
‘TWO ROWS

Metal-metal bonding and cluster compounds

Metal-metal (MM) bonding oceurs not only in the metals themsches
but also in some compounds ‘MM bonding quite rare am the fst 10%
transition elements Tt occurs only in « few earbonyl compounds such as
Mns(CO)y, Fes(CO}s, Cos(CO)q. Fey(CO), and Co4(CO))s- and in car
Doxylate complenes such as chromsm{ it) acetate Cr3{CH{COO} NO)»
fnd in solid nickel dimethylelyoxime

Tn the second and third row clements M-M boaus are much more
common
