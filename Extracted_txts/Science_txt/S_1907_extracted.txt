Stability of oxidation states

The (+11) and (+III) states are important for all the first row transition
elements. Simple ions M?* and M** are common with the first row but are
less important for second and third row elements, which have few ionic
compounds. Similarly the first row form a large number of extremely stable
complexes such as [Cr'MCI,]°~ and [Co!l"(NH,)6}°*. No equivalent
complexes of Mo or W, or Rh or Ir, are known.

The higher oxidation states of the second and third row elements are
more important and much more stable than those of the first row elements.
Thus the chromate ion {CrO,}°~ is a strong oxidizing agent but molybdate
[MoO,}7 and tungstate {WO,]°~ are stable. Similarly the permanganate
ion [MnO,]” is a strong oxidizing agent but pertechnate [TcO,]~ and
perrhenate [ReQ,]~ ions are stable.

Some compounds exist in high oxidation states which have no counter-
parts in the first row. for example WCl,. ReF;, RuOQs, OsO, and PtFs.

Complexes

The coordination number 6 is widespread in the transition elements, giving
an octahedral structure. The coordination number 4 is much less common,
giving tetrahedral and square planar complexes. Coordination numbers of
Tand § are uncommon for the first row but are much more common in the
carly members of the second and third rows. Thus in Na3[ZrF] the
[ZrF,}°~ is a pentagonal bipyramid. and in (NH4);|ZrF7] it is a capped
trigonal prism. In Cu2[ZrF,] the Zr is at the centre of a square antiprism.

Size

The second row clements are all larger than the first row elements.
Because of the lanthanide contraction the radii of the third row are almost
the same as those for the second row.

Magnetism

When transition elements form octahedral complexes, the d levels are split
IMO I. and ey sub-levels. Consider a first row clement. If the ligands
Possess a strong field they cause a large difference in energy between these
two sub-levels. Thus the electrons occupying the d level fill the lower foe
level even if this means they must be paired. If pairing of elettrons occurs,
the complex is called low spin or spin paired. Alternatively if the ligands
have only a weak field the splitting is small, and only when each of the fo»
and ¢, levels contains one electron does pairing ‘of spins occur. Such
complexes are’called high spin or spin free. Thus with a first row element

the strength of the ligand field determines whether a low-spin or a high-
spin complex is formed.

The second and third row transition elements tend to give low-spin

compleves. that is iti . j :
Dle\es, that is it is more favourable in terms of energy to pair electrons
