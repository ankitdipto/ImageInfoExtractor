‘AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS

 

sn the lower energy d levels rather than use the higher levels regardless of
the hgand

“The spin only formula gives reasonable agreement relating the observed
magnetic moment of fist row transition metal complexes tothe number of
tunparted electrons. For the second and third row transition elements the
‘orbital conteibution is sigaifieant and in addition spin orbit coupling may
‘occur Thus the spin only approximation 1s no longer valid. and more
complicated equations must be used Thus the simple interpretation of
‘magnetic moments in terms of the number of unpaired electrons cannot be
extended from the fist row of transition elements to the second and thrd
rows The second and third rows also show extensive temperature
ependent paramagnetism This 1s explained by the spin orbs couphng
removing the degeneracy from the lowest energy level i the ground state

Abundance

‘The ten frst row transition elements are reasonably common and make up
679% of the earth s crust The remaining transition clements are mostly
very scarce Even though the abundance of Zr 1s 162 ppm La31 ppm Y31
ppm and Nb 20 ppm the 20 elements in the second and third rows
elements together make up only 0 025% of the earth s crust Te does not
ccccur in nature
