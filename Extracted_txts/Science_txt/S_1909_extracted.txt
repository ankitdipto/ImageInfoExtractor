PROBLEMS

1, How would you define a transition element? List the properties
associated with transition elements.

2. How do the following properties vary in the transition elements:
(a) ionic character
(b) basic properties
(c) stability of the various oxidation states
(d) ability to form complexes?

3. Give examples of, and suggest reasons for, the following features of
transition metal chemistry:
(a) The lowest oxide of a transition metal is basic whereas the highest
oxide is usually acidic.
(b) A transition metal usually exhibits higher oxidation states in its
fluorides than in its iodides.
(c)The halides become more covalent with increasing oxidation state
of the metal and are more susceptible to hydrolysis.

4. Write notes on the following:
(a) The effective atomic number rule
(b) Ligands which stabilize low oxidation states
(c) Back bonding in metal carbonyls

. Describe the methods-by which extremely pure samples of the metals
may be prepared.
