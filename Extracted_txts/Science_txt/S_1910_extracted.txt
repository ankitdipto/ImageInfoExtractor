stable in aqueous solution, which are oxdizing and which are
reduemg?

Explain why certain ligands such as F~ tend to bing out the maximum
‘oadabon state of an element, whist others such a5 CO and dipyndyl
bag out the lowest odation states

Give reasons why carbonyl and cyanide complexes of the later
transition elements Cr, Ma, Fe, Co, Ni are more stable, more
common, and more likely to exist than similar compounds of the
s block or early transition elements

Why do the second and third rows of transition elements resemble
‘each other much more closely than they resemble the first row?

What do you understand by the terms paramagnetism and dia-
magnets? Predit the magnetic moment for octahedral complexes of
‘Fe? wath strong fietd ligands and with weak field ligands
