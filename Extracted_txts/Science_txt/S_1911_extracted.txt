INTRODUCTION

These four elements are sometimes grouped with the 14 lanthanides and
called collectively the ‘rare earths’. This is a misnomer because the
scandium group are d-block elements and the lanthanides are f-blogk
elements. In addition the scandium group is by no means rare, except {St
actinium which is radioactive. The trends in properties in the family Sc, Y.
La and Ac are quite regular, and similar to the trends in Groups 1 and 2.
There are few important industrial uses of the elements or their

compounds apart from Mischmetal., which is used in the metallurgical
industries,

 

OCCURRENCE, SEPARATION, EXTRACTION AND USES ,

Sc ‘S the thirty-first most abundant element by weight in the earth's crust.
It is thinly distributed. It occurs as tne rather rare mineral thortveitite
Sc,[SixO,]. It is available as a by-product from the extraction of U. There is
very little use for Sc or its compounds.

Y and La are the twenty-ninth and twenty-eighth most abundant
elements, They are found together with the lanthanide elements in
bastnaesite MM"CO3F. monazite MPO, and other minerals. It is
one to separate the individual elements. This is covered in
“conipounds in Chapter 29. It is also difficult to extract the metals from their

| oxid . The metals are electropositive and react with water. Their
s are very stable so that a thermite reaction cannot be used (Al,03
