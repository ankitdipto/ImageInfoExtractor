diamagnetic. The sum of the first three ionization energies for scandium is
alittle less than the sum for aluminium. The properties of scandium are
similar in some ways to those of aluminium.

SIZE

Thé covalent and ionic radii of the elements increase regularly on
descending the group as in the s-block. In the groups of transition ele-
ments shown in Table 19.3 the second and third row elements are, almost
identical in size because of the lanthanide contraction. However, this
happens after La.

CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

The metals have moderately high standard electrode potentials. They are
quite reactive, and reactivity increases with increased size. They tarnish in
air and burn in dioxygen, giving oxides MyO3. Y forms a protective oxide
coating in air, which makes it unreactive.

The metals Teact slowly with cold water, but more rapidly with hot water,
liberating hydrogen and forming either the basic oxide or the hydroxide.

basic oxide
Sc(OH); appears not to exist as a definite compound, but the basic oxide

ee is well established, and is amphoteric like Al(OH) . Since
‘andium is amphoteric, it dissolves in NaOH, liberating H2:
