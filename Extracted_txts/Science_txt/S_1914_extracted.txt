Because the oxides (and hydroxides) are either amphoters. or weak bass,
their oxosalts can be decomposed to oxides by heating. Ths s simlae to
the behaviour of Group 2 elements bat the decomposition ogcurs more
easily, € at a lower temperature

The metals react with the halogens, forming trhalides MXy These
resemble the halides of Ca The fluondes are insoluble (Ike CaF) and the
dother halides are deliquescent and very soluble (ike CaCl) 1 the
chlorides are prepared in solution, they crystallize as hydrated sels
Heating these hydrated salts does not yield anhydrous halides. On heating
ScCI(HO) decomposes to the oxide, wut the others give oxohulides

Te elements all react wih hydrogen on heaume to 300°C, forming
‘nghly conducting compounds of formula MH, These do not contam M*,
but probably contain M'* and 2H”, and have the extra electron in 2
conduction band Except for Se they ean absorb more Hs and lose tht
conducting power, forming compounds which are not quite stoichiomelt
but approach the compasinon MHy The exact composition depends onthe
temperature and the pressure of the bydrogen The hydrides react with
water, berating hydrogen, and are slike (ion) hydetdes eontatning he
