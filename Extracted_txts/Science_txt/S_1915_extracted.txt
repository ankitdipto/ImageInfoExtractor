ions and C37 ions and the free electrons are delocalized into a conduction
band. thus giving some metallic conduction.

COMPLEXES

Despite the charge of +3, the metal ions in this group do not have a strong
tendency to form complexes. This is because of their fairly large size. Sc3*
is the smallest ion in the group and forms complexes more readily than the
other elements. These include [Sc(OH),]*~ and [ScF,]°~, both of which
have a coordination number of 6 and are octahedral in shape.

ScF; + 3NH.F > 3NH} + [ScF,]°-

By far the most common donor atom in complexes is O, and complexes
occur particularly with chelating ligands. Thus complexes are formed with
strong complexing agents such as oxalic acid, citric acid, acetylacetone and
EDTA. The complexes of the larger metals Y and La often have higher
coordination numbers than 6, and coordination number 8 is the most
common. Thus [Sc(acetylacetone);] has a coordination number of 6 and is
octahedral. Y(acetylacetone);(H2O)] has a coordination number of 7 and
the structure is a capped trigonal prism. In [La(acetylacetone), - (H2O)2]
the coordination number is 8 and the structure is a distorted square
antiprism. In [La- EDTA: (H2O),4]-3H2O the EDTA forms four bonds
from O atoms and two from N atoms, and the O atoms in the four water
molecules all form bonds to La, giving a coordination number of 10. The
ions NO3 and SO}" also act as bidentate ligands and form complexes with
high coordination numbers. In [Sc(NO3)s}°~ four NO3 groups are
bidentate and one is unidentate giving a coordination number of 9. In
[Y(NO3)sP> all five NOS groups are bidentate and the coordination
number is 10. In Las(SO.4)3- 9H2O half of the La atoms are 12-coordinate.

Lanthanum salts have been used as a biological tracer. La** appears to
replace Ca** in the conduction of nerve impulses along the axons of nerve
Cells, and also in structure promoting in cell membranes. La** is readily
detected by electron spin resonance. The similarity in biological role may
arise because the ions are similar in size (La** = 1.032 A, Ca?* = 1.00 A).
