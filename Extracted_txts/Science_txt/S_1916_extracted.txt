INTRODUCTION

‘Tiranum sa commereally important element Vast quantities of T1Op are
used as.a pigment and filler and Ti metals important for ts strength OW
density and corrosion resistance TiCh ts important as 3 Ziegler-Natta
‘catalyst for mabing polythene and other polymers Zirconium 1s used 10
‘make the cladding for fuel rods in water cooled nuclear reactors. Haftium
3s used 10 make control rods for certain reactors

     
 

OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE

‘Thos she minth most abundant clement by weight in the earth's erust The
smaun ores are hmeaite FeTiOy and rule TIO, In 1992 world production
was 7 8 million tonnes of simenite and 471000 tonnes of rutile These had a
TiO- content of 4 1 mullion tonnes. The main producers are Canada 27%,
Australia 24% and Norway 9% Zr w the eighteenth most abundant
element and ss found mainly a8 zutean ZSiQ, and small amounts of
baddeleyite ZrO, World production of zirconium minerals was 80800
tonnes in 1992 HC very similar n sze and properties to Zr because of
the fanthanwe contraction Thus Hi occurs 10 the extent of 1~2% 1m Zt
cores Its particularly dificult to sep rate Zr and Hf even more difficult
than separating the Fanthanudes
