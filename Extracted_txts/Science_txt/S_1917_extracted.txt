EXTRACTION AND USES

Ti has been called ‘the wonder metal’ because of its unique and useful
properties. It is very hard, high melting (1667 °C) and is stronger and much
lighter than steel (densities Ti = 4.4gem™, Fe = 7.87 gcm™*). However,
even traces of non-metal impurities, for example H, C, N or O, make Ti,
and also the other two metals Zr and Hf, brittle. Ti has better corrosion
resistance than stainless steel. It is a better conductor of heat and electricity
than Group 3 (Sc group) metals. Ti metal and alloys of Ti with Al are used
extensively in the aircraft industry in jet and gas turbine engines, and in
airframes. Supersonic aircraft like Concorde can use Al as the structural

skin (m.p. 660°C) by limiting the speed to Mach 2.2 (2.2 times the speed of
sound). If and when SST (supersonic transport) planes are made which fly
at three times the speed of sound, it is probable that they will be made of Ti
(m.p. 167°C). Ti is also used in marine equipment and in chemical plant.
Small amounts of Ti alloyed with steel harden and toughen the steel.
World production of Ti metal is almost 50000 tonnes per year.
b The metal is difficult to extract because of its high melting point and
reause It reacts readily with air, dioxygen, dinitrogen, and hydrogen at
‘ levated temperatures. The oxide cannot be reduced by C or CO because it
poems carbides, Since TiO; is very stable, the first stage is to form TiCl, by
‘ating it with C and Cl, at 900°C,

TiO, + 2C + 2Ch— TiCl, + 2CO

2FeTiO3 + 6C + 7Cl, > 2TICL, + 6CO + 2FeCl;

TiCl, is a liquid (b.p. 137°C) and is removed from FeCl, and other

imputities by distillation. One of the following methods is then used.
