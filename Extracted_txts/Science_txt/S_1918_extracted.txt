Kroll process

Ongmnally Wilhelm Kroll produced Ts by reducing TiCl, wath Ca sn an
electric furnace Later Mg was used_and Imperial Mctal Industnes (IMI)
use Na mstead A‘ this temperature Ti i highly reactive and reacts realy
sth arc or Ny ts therefore necessary to perform the reaction under an
mosphere of argon
Tick + Mg ES, y+ aMgCl

‘The MgCl formed can be removed by leaching with water, or better with
dilute HCL as ths dissolves any excess Mg Alternatively the MgCl is
removed by vacuum distillation ‘This leaves a sponge of Tt rather than a
sold block ‘The Tr 1s converted to the massive form by melting ian
electric are under a high vacuum oF an atmosphere of argon ‘The IN
process is almost the same TiC 1s reduced by Na under an atmosphere of
§rgon, and NaCl 1s leached out with water ‘The T181 the form of small
tranales ‘These canbe fabncated into metal parts using “powder forming
techniques and sintering in an inert atmosphere. The high fuel cots, the
necessity to vse argon, the cost of Mg ot Na, and the need to reheat 3
second time all make Ti expensive The high cost prevents ts being more
widely used Zirconium w ako produced by the Kroll process

‘The van Athelde Boer method

Small amounts of very pure metal can be produced by this process Impure

boils at 600°C Under reded pressure however the boring points are
lower The gaseous Ml, 1s decomposed on a white hot tungsten filament

Zris produced on a much smatier scale than Ti Zr 1s even more corrosion
resistant than sTh, and js used in chermcal plants Its most umportant use
to make the cladding (that 1s the casing) for UO» fuel in water cooled
tuclear reactors Its corrosion resistance. high melting point (1857°C) and
low absorption of neutrons make t very sutable (Of the metallic elements
only Be and Mg have fower neutron absorption cross sections than ZF
‘They are unsuitable for use as cladding as Be ss bnitle and Mg corrodes 100
castly) Hf always occurs with Zr Their chemical properties are almost
dential, and for most purposes there 1S no need to separate them How
ever, Hf absorbs neutrons very strongly. and Zr used for cladding must Be
free from Hf

“The similanty in size of the vons makes separation exceedinely dificult
