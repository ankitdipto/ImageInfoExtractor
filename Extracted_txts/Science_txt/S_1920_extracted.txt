sncrease in size 1s that between La and Hf the 4f level is filled with the 14
anthanide elements. These 1S a small decrease in sizé from one lanthanide
element to the next ‘The overall decrease in size across the 14 elements is
called the lanthanide contraction (see Chapter 29) The decrease in sue
‘caused by the lanthanide contraction cancels out the expected size increase
from Zr to HE Since the sizes of Hf and La are almost identical and they.
have a similar outer electrom structure, their chemucal properties a
almost identical Separation of these two clements 1s difficult as noted
above under ‘Extraction and uses’

REACTIVITY AND PASSIVE BEHAVIOUR

‘The compact (massive) forms of the metals are unreactive or passive at fow
and moderate temperatures. This results from 2 thin impermeable oxide
film which forms on the surface and prevents further attack This 1s
particularly effectie with Ti (Note however, that the finely divided
‘metals are pyraphoric ) At room temperature the metals are unaffected by
enher acids or alkali However Ti dissolves slowly im hot concentrated
HCI, grving T* and Hy This oxidized by hot HNOs giving the hydrated
oxide TiO: (H20), Zr dissolves in hot concentrated HySOx and aqua
regia The best solvent for all the metals 1s HF, because they fom
hexafluoro complexes

 

Ti+ OHF + HATF,) + 2H:

‘At about 450°C all three metals begin to react with many substances At
temperatures over 600°C they are hnghly reactive They form oxides MO
hahdes MX,, interstitial mtnides MN and interstitial carbides MC by direct
combination’ Like the scandium group, the powdered metals absoxb Hy
‘The amount absorbed depends on the temperature and pressure, and
tntersttal compounds are formed of liating compasition MH3_ These
interstitial hydrides are stable 1n aur and are unaffected by water Thisisin
‘contrast to the behaviour ofthe oni hydrides of the seandium group and
s-block elements
