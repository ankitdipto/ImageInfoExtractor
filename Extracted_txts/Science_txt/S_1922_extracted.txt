T1p, Z1O, and HO, are all very stable white solids, a7e non volatile
and are rendered tefractory by strong ignition On strong heating ZrO,
becomes very hard and is high melting point of 2700°C and ts resistance
to chemical attack make st useful for making high temperature crucibles
and fornace hnngs Fibres of ZrO, are made commercially and are
ssmiar to those of Al,Ox described im Chapter 12 If the solids have been
prepared ary, or have been heated, they do not react with acids If they
are prepared in solution, for example by hydrolysing TiCls, the ox
dusolves in HC HF and H,S0., forming complexes [TiCi™. [Tiff
or (THSO3))]-

I the oxides TO2, ZrO, or HfO2 are fused (at temperatures of 1000-

‘The ilmenite structure consists ofa lattice of hexagonal close packed O
atoms, with Ti atoms occupying one third of the octahedeal ites, and Fe

‘This structure 1s formed when the other metal 1s about the same size as Ti
‘The structure is the same as corundum Ai,Os, except that corundum has
