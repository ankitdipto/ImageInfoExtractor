out of direct sunlight. There are iwo different hydrated forms of Ti!"'Cl3.
These have different colours. In one complex the Ti!" is surrounded by six
HO molecules, [Ti(H20),]°* 3CI~, and in the other it is surrounded by
five H.O molecules and one CI”, giving [TiCI(H2O)s}°* 2Cl~. These two
environments give rise to a different degree of crystal field splitting of the d
levels: hence the energy jump for the single d electron is different in the
wo cases, and their colours are different.

Ti** is used in volumetric analysis for the determination of Fe** and also
Organic nitro compounds. In the iron titration the end point may be
detected with ammonium thiocyanate which remains red whilst any Fe** is

Present, or by methylene blue which is reduced and decolorized as soon as
Ti* is in excess.
