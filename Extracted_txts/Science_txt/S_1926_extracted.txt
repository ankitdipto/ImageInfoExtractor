‘Zuegler—Natta catalysts

Solutions of AIEts and TiC1, 19 a hydrocarbon solvent react exothermicaly
to form a brown solid. This 1s the important Ziegler—Natta catalyst for
polymerizing ethene (ethylene) to form polythene Ziegler and Natta were
awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1963 for this work (See also
‘Chapter 12) (Similar entalytiretvty has been found from muxtures of Lt
Be or Ai alkyls with halides from Groups 4 Sand 6 the Ti V and Cr
‘roups

‘The AIEt/TiC. catalyst 1s of great commercial importance It produces
stereoregular polymers (that 1s polymers where the molecules have the
same orientation) These are stronger and have higher melting points then
atactie or random polymers. Practically any alkene can be polymerized

‘A large amount of work has been directed to how the catalyst works
‘The active species s Ti" and the AIEt, can reduce TiCl, to TiCh in situ
oor TiCh may be added instead Then one of the Ct atoms is replaced by an
ethyl group A possible mechanism is that the double bond «n ethene
attaches itself to 2 vacant site on a Thatom on the surface ofthe catalyst A
carbon shit reaction occurs and the ethene migrates and 1s inserted
between Ts and Cin the Ti—Et bond This extends the C chatn from t¥o
to four atoms leaving a vacant ste on Ti The process1s repeated and the
Chain grows in length A similar reaction accurs with other alkenes such
4s propylene CHy—CH=CH, When the double bond attaches to 7 the
CCH group must always point away from the surface sumply because the
reaction occurs on a surface Thus when the molecule migrates and 15
inserted into the TiC bond st always has the same onentation Ths 18
called cis insertion of the alkene and explains why the polymers produced
are stereoregular

Polymerization of ethene was originally carried out using a high tem
perature and pressure By using a Ziegler~Natta catalyst polymenzation
can be carned out under relayvely mild conditions from room temperature
to 93°C and from atmospheric pressure to 100 atmospheres Eventually
the product 1s hydrolysed with water or alcohol and the eatalyst #8
removed The polymer produced stalled high density polythene and hat@
density 0 95-0 97 gem”? and a melting point of 135°C. It has a molecular
‘weight of 20000-30000 and consists of stranght chans with very ile
branching This form of polythene 1s relatively hard and suff Another
