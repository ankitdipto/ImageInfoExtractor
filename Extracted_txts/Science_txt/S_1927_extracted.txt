form of polythene called low-density polythene is much softer and has a
lower density, 0.91-0.94gcm7*, and a lower melting point of about
115°C. This consists of much branched chains, and is produced by a free
tadical polymerization of ethene and a promoter under much more severe
conditions (190-210°C and 1500 atmospheres pressure). Production of all
forms of polythene was 24.6 million tonnes, and of polypropylene 12
million tonnes, both in 1991.

Other compounds

No stable carbonyl compounds are known. Ti(CO), has been formed using
the matrix isolation technique by condensing Ti vapour and CO in a solid
matrix of inert gas at very low temperatures. It has been studied spectro-
scopically. The absence of carbonyls is probably due to the shortage of d
electrons for back bonding.

Cyclopentadienyl compounds are much more stable and better known.
In describing organometallic compounds it is convenient to describe the
hapticity n of a group as the number of C atoms associated with the metal.
Several stable bis(cyclopentadienyls) are known such as [Ti(n’-CsHs)2
{COS}, [Ti(mF-CoHa(NR2)2} and * {Ti{n®-CsHs)o(SCN)2}. The  struc-
tures are roughly tetrahedral, but the cyclopentadienyl molecules are
pentahaptic, that is five C atoms in each ting are attached to Ti. Reduction
of these compounds gives [Ti(CsHs)9- X] or [Ti(CsHs)2]. The latter
formula resembles ferrocene [Fe(CsHs)2], but the structure of the Ti
compound is dimeric, and hence is different.
