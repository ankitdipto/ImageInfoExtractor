‘Tetra{eyctopentadienyl) compounds such as T(CsHs)s can be made
from THCl, and NaCsHs The fornmula may be wntten (Ti(yCsHs),
(nl-CsHs)s], where ewo eyclopentadienyl rings are attached by five C
toms (7 bonded) and two rings are attached by one C atom (c bonded)
Nuclear magnene resonance studies on these tetra(cyclopentadieny))
compounds suggest that in the n! rings the C bonded to Ti continually
changes, and also the 1° and n! rings interchange thett roles Hf forms sn
‘dentical compound, but rather surprisingly the Zr compound has three 1°
rings and only one n ring

‘Only a few alkyis and aryls are known_and they are generally unstable
ant and water C4Hs T(C3H,O)3, CHsTiCly and Ti(CHz Ph)s are stable
at 10°C, and TCE), is stable below ~20°C Most compounds with an
alkyl group attached to Ti will plymenze alkenes

Some organometallic Ti"! compounds are able to fix Nz gas and produce
NH, One evample 15 (CroHioTi)s This cycle could be simalar to the
sdimstrogen fixation process m nature (Dimtrogen complexes are discussed
under ruthenum(H1) complexes in Chapter 24 )
