impurities usually V30; 18 red or orange ) Over 75% of the V.0s
converted to an sron/vanadium alloy called ferrovanadium ‘This contaies
about 50% Fe It w made by heating VO. with son oF ston omde and
a reducing agent such as C, Al or ferrosilicon Ferrovanadium 1s used
commercially t0 make steel alloys for springs and high speed cutting 1ools
‘Vanadium metal ss seldom used on ts own It s dificult 10 prepare because
at the elevated temperatures used in metallurgy 1t reacts wath O, Nzand
© Pure vanadium can be obtained by reducing VCI, with H or Mg by
reducing VsO, with Ca or by electrolysing a fused halide complex Workd
production of V in alloys and pure metal was 28400 tonnes in 1992,
3041s extremely important as the catalyst in the conversion of SO, 0
'SOs1n the Contact process for making H,SO, It has replaced Pt as catalyst

because st 1s much cheaper and ss less susceptible to powsoning by
impurities such as arseme Vanadium isan important catalyst ovation
reactions such as naphthalene ~» phthalic acid and toluene —» benzal
Sehyde A Cu/V alloy s used as a catalstin the oxidation of cyclohexanol!
cyclohexanone mixtures to adipic acid. (Adipic acid 8 used to make aylon
66 ) Vanadium 1s also used as a catalyst for the reduction (hydrogenation)
of alkenes antl aromatic hydrocarbons

Niobium and tantalum occur together The most umportant miner
1s pyfochlorte CaNaNb,O,F Much smaller amounts of columtite
(Fe Mn)Nb;O, and tantalite (Fe Mn)TasO, are also mined However
0% of Ta is recovered from the slag from extraciing Sn The ores
dissolved enter by fusion wath alkal or wp acid. Formerly separation of ND
and Ta was achieved by treatment with a solution of HF when Nb formed
soluble Ks[NBOF,] and Ta formed insoluble Ks[TaF)] Separation 1s 10%
performed by solvent extraction from dilute HF to methyl wobute! ketone
The metals are obtained exher by reducing the pentorides with Na, of BS
electrolysis of molten fluoro compleves such as Ky[NDF;] In 1992 world
production was 15200 tonnes of Nb and 60M tonnes of Ta

Nb used in various stainless steels and Nbistee! used to encapsulate
the fuel elements for some nuclear reactors A Nb/Zr alloy 1s 2 supe
conductor at fow temperatures and is used to make wire for very power!
electromagnets Tas used to make éapacitors forthe electronics nds!)
Because it 1s not resected by the human body 11s valuable for makine

‘metal plates, screws and wie for epainng badly fractured bones Tantalum
carbide TaC 1s one of the hughest melting solids known (about 3800°C)
