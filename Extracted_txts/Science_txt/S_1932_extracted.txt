‘At high temperatures all three metals react with many non-metals. The
products are often intersutial compounds which are non storchiometne

'V forms many different posiine rons but Nb and Ta form vstually none
‘Thus though Nb and Ta are metals, thete compounds in the (+V) state are
mostly covalént, volatile, and readily hydrolysed ~ properties associated
with non-metals

“The tendency to form simple onic compounds decreases as the oxidaion

the solid and in solution {as hevahydrate tons) They have an extensive
aqueous chemistry The oxidation state (HIV) 1s dominated by the Vo?

COLOUR

Colour in transition metal compounds very commonly anses from ded
eleetromie transitions It can also arse from defects an the solid state (sce
Chapter 3) and from charge transfer spectra (Charge transfer spect are
‘scussed under Srl, m Chapter 13 ) The oxidation st. tes belon (+V} are
coloured because they have an incomplete d shell of electrons and give dd
spectra Howeser the (+V) state has a d® configuration and so cotoustess
compounds would be expected NbFs, TaF and TaCl« are white, but V.0,
's red or orange, NbCic 1s yellow, NbBr< 18 orange and Nblc 1s brass
coloured The colours arse because of charge transfer
