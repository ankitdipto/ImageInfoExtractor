| (707)

such as NbC and TaC are interstitial, refractory and very hard, like TiC
and H{C in the previous group. TaC has the highest melting point of any
compound, about 3800°C. In contrast, carbides such as VC; are ionic and

react with water, liberating ethyne.

All three elements react with H2 on heating, forming nonstoichiometric
hydrides. The amount of hydrogen absorbed depends on the temperature
and pressure. Here, as in the titanium group, the metal lattice expands as
hydrogen enters interstitial positions. Thus the density of the hydride is less
than that of the metal. It is difficult to decide if these are true compounds
or solid solutions, as the maximum hydrogen contents are VHo 7), NbHo.s6

and TaHp. 76.

HALIDES

When V is heated with the halogens, halides of different oxidation states
are formed: VFs, VCly, VBr3 and VI3. Nb and Ta react with all of the
halogens on heating to give pentahalides MXs. The range of halides which
have been formed is summarized in Table 21.4. All the halides are volatile,

covalent and hydrolysed by water.
