Figure 21 1 Tetramene structure of NDFs and TaF

VF, isa colourless quid but the other pentahalides are solids They adopt
several different structures The fluores are built of octahedeal ME, unts
swath two cis fluorine atoms in each octahedron acting as bridging groups
V—F—-V wath other octahedra. VF forms long chains of octahedra in ths
way, but NbFs and TaF. form eyche tetramers with four octahedra tained
an this way (Figure 21 1)

‘This structure 1s also found mn other pentahalides, e g MOF, RUF; and
OSF, Solid NbCI, and TaCls are dimene with two octahedra jomned by
sharing two corners 1¢ one edge (Figure 21 2)

All of the pentahalides can be sublimed under an atmosphere of the
appropriate halogen In the vapour phase they probably enst as mono
mene trigonal bipyramids

‘The pentafluorides all react with F~ rons, forming, octahedral (MF,)”
complexes As in Group 4, the heavier elements can form complexes
with higher coardiaation numbers With high concentrations of F™ the
complexes (NDOF,)*, (NDF;[?~ and [TaF;P™ are formed The structures
Of the seven coordinate species are capped tngonal prisms 1¢_ a tngonal
prism with one extra atom mn a rectangular face (see Figure 20:36) With
fan even higher concentration of F~, Ta forms [TaFs}~ with a square
anuipnsm structure (Figure 20 3c) white Nb forms (NbOFep™ which i an
octahedron with an extra atom in one of the faces. This snabulty of Ta to
form oxohahides has been used to separate Nb and Ta

‘On warming the halides ME, and MCls with donors such as dumethyt
ether (CH,):0 or dimethyl sulphoxide (CH3);S0, the halides extract Q
and form oxocklorides MOCI; Oxohalides are also formed when the
pentaholides are heated in ait VOCIy-can also be made by heating
Vi0s with Ch; (or sometimes C and Cis) The oxohalides are all readily
hydrolysed by water to the hydrated pentoxide The oxohaldes are
tetrahedral im shape

‘The pentahalides react with N;O, in giving solvated nitrates such as
NbO; NOs 0 67MeCN, and anhydrous nitrates such as NbO(NOs)s

‘The (+V) halides have a d® configuration, and cannot give d=d spectra
‘The fluondes are white but the other hahdes are coloured due vo charge
transfer spectra
