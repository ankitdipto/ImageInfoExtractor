(+1V) halides

All the tetrahalides are known except TaF,. These may be prepared as
follows: , .

V + HF VF,

VCl, is tetrahedral in the gas. The d' configuration of V(+IV) would be
expected to make this unstable and to cause distortion, Jn the liquid it is
dimeric, NbF, is a black, paramagnetic involatile solid made up of regular
octahedra joined in a chain by their edges. The tetrachlorides, tetra-
bromides and tetraiodides of Nb and Ta are also brown—black solids and
are diamagnetic. This suggests extensive metal-metal interaction. In Nbl,,
the structure is a chain of octahedra joined by their edges. The Nb atoms
are displaced from the centre of the NbI, octahedron and occur in pairs,
thus permitting weak Nb—Nb bonds of length 3.20A, and pairing the
previously unpaired electron spins (Figure 21.3). NbCl, is similar and has
M—M bonds of length 3.06 A.
The tetrahalides tend to disproportionate:
