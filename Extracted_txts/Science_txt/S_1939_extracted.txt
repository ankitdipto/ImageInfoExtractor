paramagnetic and the magnetic moment corresponds to one unpaired
electron. Cluster compounds of this type are characteristic of the lower
oxidation states of Nb and Ta. Many of these cluster compounds are
soluble in water, and the cluster remains intact during reactions. The
clusters can be oxidized:

[MeXi2]?* > [MpXy2]** > [MoX12]**

A very unusual structure is found in Nb¢l,,, where the six Nb atoms form
an octahedral cluster as before, but eight iodine atoms are situated above
the eight faces of the octahedron. Each of these I atoms act as bridging
group to three metal atoms within the octahedron. The rest of the I atoms
are bonded to the six corners of the metal octahedron. These act as
halogen bridges to other octahedra. The formula is thus [Nbglg] + 46
which is Nbgly).

OXIDES ~

The metals all react with dioxygen at elevated temperatures and give
pentoxides M2Os. V2Os is orange or red depending on the state of division,
but the others are white. When made this way, VO) can also be formed.
Pure V.O; is obtained either by acidifying ammonium metavanadate, or
simply by heating it:

2NH,VO; + H,SO,— V20s(hydrated) + (NH4)2SO4 + H,O

' 2NH,VO07225 V0, + 2NH, + H,O

The main oxides formed are shown in Table 21.5. The lower oxides otten
exist over a wide range of composition.

(+V) oxides

The oxides M205 can all be made by heating the metal in dioxygen.
However, V.O, is best made by heating ammonium metavanadate
NH,VOy. Nb,O and Ta,O« are commonly made by ignition of other Nb
or Ta compounds in air. In the pentoxides the metal atoms all have a d?
configuration, and might be expected to be colourless. NbzOs and Ta2Os
are white, but V.O5 is orange or red coloured due to charge transfer.
