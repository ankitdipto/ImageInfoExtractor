GROUPS THE VANADIUM GROUP

 

V0 15 amphoteric, but 1s mainly acidic Wath very strong NaOH 1
forms colourless orthosanadate rons VO!" At shghtly higher pH ese
polymere to form a wide range of wsopolyacids called polyvanadates
‘These are desenbed later V0 dissolves in very strong acid, forntng
‘eventually the pale yellow dioxovanadum{V) ion VOS This 1on haé an
angular shape Some reactions of V30s are as follows

V,0.+ NaOH — sanous vanadates,

V0, + HQ, ~+ peroxovanadates (red colour)

Vi0.+ Cl; -+ VOCh

V0, + $0; — VO, + SO,

V0, + Hy VO: + V20,
‘Though NbO, and Ta;0¢ react with HF_and form mobates and tantalates
whea fused with NaOH they are better descnbed as unreactive rather then
amphotene

‘The structure of VO, 1s unusual and consists of distorted trigenal

bipyramids of VO, units sharing edges wath other units to form zig 228
double chains Its use as a catalyst m the Contact process has beet
mentioned previously The catalyuc actwty may be because it €20
reversibly lose or gain oxygen when heated

(#1V) oxides

VO, can be mate from VsO« with mild reducing agents such as Fe2* SO:
or oxalic acid V(+1'V) has ad! configuration and VO. 1s dark blue 19
colour The oxde i araphotene, but 1s more bast than acidic. In acids
Wt forms blue solutions containing the oxovanadwm(IV) 10n VO"*
“Tass 1s commonly called the vanadyl 1on A large mumber of vani®st
compounds are known vanadyl sulphate VOSO, and vanadyl halides
