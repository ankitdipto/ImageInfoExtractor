(pyridine)]. In these compounds the V—O bonds are 1.56-1.59 A. This is
shorter than a single bond, and the bond is better represented as V==O.
The x bond arises from back bonding from a filled p orbital on O with an
empty d orbital on V, similar to the oxides and oxoacids of phosphorus.

(+I) oxides

V;03 is nonstoichiometric (VO;,35-1.5) and contains simple ions arranged
in the corundum Al,O; type of structure. It can be produced by high
temperature reduction of V2Os with carbon or hydrogen, or by electrolytic
reduction of a vanadate. The oxide is completely basic. It dissolves in
acids, forming blue or green ‘hydrated ions [V(H20).}**, and these
solutions are quite strongly reducing. Addition of NaOH precipitates
hydrated V(OH)s, but this has no tendency to dissolve in excess NaOH.
The oxidation state (+III) has a d? configuration, and the-oxide is black
and the hydrated ion is blue. A considerable number of octahedral com-
plexes are known such as [V(H2O).]°*, [VFe]°~, [V(CN).]>” and
[V(oxalate);]>-. Vanadium also forms a triacetate complex, which is
dimeric [V'",(acetate)s]. This has an unusual structure. Four of the acetate
groups act as bridging groups through O atoms to the two V atoms. The
Temaining two acetate groups act as unidentate ligands and one is attached to
each V. The structure is related to the structures of chromium(III) acetate
[Ci,(acetate), + (H2O)2] and copper acetate [Cu (acetate), - (H2O),]. (See
Figure 22.2.) Both are dimeric, and both have four bridging acetate
groups, but the terminal acetate groups in the V compound are replaced
by two molecules of water. In water, [V(H2O).]}°** partially hydrolyses to
V(OH)** and VO*.

(+H) oxides

VO is nonstoichiometric, of composition VOpo 94-4.12- The solid is ionic and
has a defect NaCl type of structure. The (+I) state has a d° configuration,
and the oxide is grey—black and has a metallic lustre. It is made by reducing
V205 with hydrogen at 1700°C. It has a fairly high electrical conductiv-
ty, which is probably due to metal-metal bonding in the structure. The
oxide is completely basic, and is soluble in water. Addition of NaOH to
this solution Precipitates V(OH)2. VO dissolves in acids, forming violet
coloured [V(H,0).}** ions. These solutions are strongly reducing, and are
very readily oxidized both by air and water. Thus the violet solution soon
turns green through oxidation to [V(H,0),}°*. A few octahedral complexes
are known such as K4[V(CN),]-7H,O and [V(ethylenediamine)3]Cl.

K,[V(CN);]-2H0 is also known, and the structure of the anion is a
Pentagonat bipyramid.
