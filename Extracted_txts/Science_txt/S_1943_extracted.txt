ether. The zero-valent state occurs with [V(CO),]. This is not very stable.
Since V has an odd atomic number, it follows that in V(CO), it has an
“unpaired electron and hence an incomplete shell of electrons. Other first
row metal carbonyls with an unpaired electron dimerize and form a M—M
bond, thus pairing the electrons. V(CO), is unusual in that it remains
monomeric. [V(dipyridyl)3] is another example of V(0). The (+1) state is
found in [V(dipyridyl)3]*.

ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS

This group does not form many compounds with M—C o bonds. The main
examples are V(CO), which, though pyrophoric and not very stable, can
be prepared in much larger quantities than Ti(CO)s. An unusual
compound hexakis(dinitrogen) [V(N2)¢] is also known, and is thought to
be isoelectronic and isostructural with the carbonyl.

V forms bis(cyclopentadieny!) compounds such as [V(n* -CsHs)2Ch],
[V(n5 - CsHs)2Cl] and [V(n> — CsHs)2]. The last is a simple sandwich com-
pound and is called vanadocene. This is like ferrocene in the next chapter,
and unlike the titanium compounds. The hapticity n° indicates that in
each ring five carbon atoms are ‘bonded’ to V. Vanadocene is extremely
air sensitive, and is a dark violet paramagnetic solid. Nb and Ta also
form cyclopentadienyl compounds such as [Nb(7° — CsHs)2(7' — CsHs)2],
in which two rings are 4°, and two rings are 7! bonded. Other complexes
are [Nb(q°~ CsHs)2Cl,] and [Nb(7° — CsHs)2Cl].-
