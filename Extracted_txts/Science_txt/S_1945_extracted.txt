INTRODUCTION

Chromium metal is produced on a large scale, and is used extensively in
ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, and for electroplating. The métals
molybdenum and tungsten are produced in appreciable amounts. Sodium
dichromate is also used in large amounts. CrO3 and Cr,03 are both used
commercially.

Tungstate and molybdate ions both form extensive series of iso- and
heteropolyacids. Chromium(II) acetate has an unusual structure with a
quadruple bond. The lower halides MoX2 and WX, form interesting
cluster compounds based on the octahedral [MgXg]** metal cluster. Mo is
important in the fixation of dinitrogen.

 

ABUNDANCE, EXTRACTION AND USES

Chromium is the twenty-first most abundant element by weight in the
carth’s crust. This is about as common as chlorine. Molybdenum and

tungsten are quite rare (Table 22.2).
