(Chromite hasa shght lustre and fooks hike patch, with a brownish cast toa
colour It may be sightly magnetic World production of chromite was 11 $
million tonnes 1n 1992, with 2 Cr content of 3 milion connes The largest
sources of chromite ore ate the Soviet Union 32%, South Africa 30%.
‘Turkey and India 9% each, and Albania and Zimbabwe 5% each Small
amounts of crocoite PCO, and chrome ochre Cr20s ate also mined

‘Chromium 1s produced im two forms ferrochrome and pure Cr metal
depending on what 11s to be used for Fercochrome 1s an alloy containihé
Fe, Cr and © Its produced by reducing chromite with C In 1991, 31
iuillion tonnes of ferrochrome were produced Its used to make many
ferrous alloys, including stainless steel and hard chtommam steel

Several steps are required to obtain pure chromium First chromite s fused
‘with NaOH in air, when the Cris oxidized to sodium chromate
2FeCrH"O, + SNAOH + $0, HS, ana,{Ce"'O,) + Fe:0, + 4,0

Fe,Qy 1s insoluble but sodium chromate s soluble “Thus the Na,{Cr0,)
removed by dissolving 1 1m water, and 1s then acidified to give sodiv®,
dichromate This 1s less soluble, and can be precipitated The sodio™
dichromate 1s reduced to Cr40s by heating wath C

Finally Cr,Os 1s reduced to the metal by Al or St
Cray + 2AL—+ 2Cr + AQOs

Since the metals brite, st seldom used on ss own It used to make
non ferrous alloys Alteraatwely COs 6 dissaleed ra USOq, ad
deposited electrolytically on the surface of a metal This both protects the
metal from corrosion and ges ia shiny appearance

Molybdenum occurs as the mineral molybdenste MoS» World prods”
‘von of ores in 1992 had a molybdenum content of 129000 tonnes The
largest sources are the USA 38% and China 29% Some MoS; 1s a0
