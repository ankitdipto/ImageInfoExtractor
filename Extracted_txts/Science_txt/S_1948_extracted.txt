‘The most stable oxidation states are hold_unstable are bracketed

oxidation states become more stable and the lower states become less
stable A Iist of Known oxides and haltdes 1s given in Table 22 3

GENERAL PROPERTIES

‘The metals are hard and have very high melting pounts and law voltty
(Fable 22.4) The melting pount of W's the next highest to carboa

‘Cor unreactive ot passive at low temperatures becamse ns proneeted2y
a surface coating of oxide thus resembling Ti and V in previous grOUPS
{ti because of this passive behaviour that Cr 1s extenswely used for
electroplating onto on and other metals to prevent corrosion Cr dissolves
