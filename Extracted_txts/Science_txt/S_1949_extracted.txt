in HCl and H2SO,, but is passivated by HNO; or aqua regia. Mo and W
are relatively inert, and are only slightly attacked by aqueous acids and
alkalis. Mo reacts initially with HNOg, but then becomes passive. Both Mo
and W dissolve in HNO,/HF mixtures, and also in fused Na2O, and fused
KNO,/NaOH. Cr reacts with HCI gas, forming anhydrous CrCl, and H2.

The metals do not react with O2 at normal temperatures (apart from the
surface coating). However, on strong heating Cr forms a-Cr203, which is
grcen coloured and has a corundum structure. In contrast, Mo and W form
MO. Similarly, on heating Cr with the halogens, trivalent halides CrXy
are formed. In contrast Mo and W form MCl, on heating with Cl,, and
MF, is formed at room temperature.

2Cr + 302 > Cr,O3
2Mo + 30; > 2Mo0,
2Cr + 3Cl, > 2CrClh,
Mo + 3Cl, > MoCl,

As a result of the lanthanide contraction, there is a close similarity in the
size and the properties of Mo and W. The difference between these two
elements is greater than in Group 4 between Zr and Hf and in Group 5
between Nb and Ta. Thus Mo and W can be easily separated in the
conventional scheme for qualitative analysis of metals: WO3(H20),, is
precipitated with the insoluble chlorides in Group 1, and molybdates are
reduced by HS in Group 2 and MoS, and S are precipitated.
