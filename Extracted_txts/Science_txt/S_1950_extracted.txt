(4VD) STATE

A limted number of Cx(+V1) compounds are known These are very
‘strong oxidizing agents and snelude chromates [CrO,]?~ dichromates

Chromate and dichromate

Sodium chromate NaxCrOs 1s a yellow solid, and should stnctly be called
sodium chromate(V1) Its preparation from chromite by fusing with NaOH.
and oxidizing with arr has already been desenbed under “Abundance,
‘extraction and uses’, and ican also be prepared by fusion with Na;COs

4FeCr,O; + BN2:COs + 70; ~+ 8NaxCrO, + 2Fe:O, + 8CO;

Te 1s quite soluble in water and 1s a strong oxdming agent Sodium
@ichromate Na;Cr.0; 15 an orange coloured solid, and 1s made by
acidifying a chromate solution The dichromate 1s less soluble in water, and
15 wadely used as an oxidizing agent KxCraO> s preferred to Na;CriOr for
use 1n volumetric analysis (Iitrations) because the Na compound 15
hygroscopic whilst the K compound 1s not Thus KxCr2O, can be used as 4
