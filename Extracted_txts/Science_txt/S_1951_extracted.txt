Peroxo compounds

When hydrogen peroxide is added to an acidified solution of a dichromate
(or any other Cr(+VI) species), a complicated reaction occurs. The
products depend on the pH and the concentration of Cr.

1,037 + 2H* + 4H,0, > 2CrO(O2)2 + SH;O

A deep blue-violet coloured peroxo compound CrO(Qy)2 is formed.
This decomposes rapidly in aqueous solution into Cr** and dioxygen.
The peroxo compound can be extracted into ether, where it reacts with
pyridine, forming the adduct py - CrO(Oz)2 (Figure 22.1a). The structure
of this is approximately a pentagonal pyramid. Cr is at the centre of a
pentagon of four O atoms (from the two peroxo groups) and the N from
pyridine, and one O above the pentagon in an apical position.

In less acidic solutions K,Cr.07 and HzO, give salts which are violet col-
oured and diamagnetic. These are thought to contain [CrO(O,)(OH)]~,
but the structures are not-known as the compounds are explosive. In
alkaline solution with 30% H,O2, a red—brown compound K3CrOg is
formed which is a tetraperoxo species [Cr(O)4]*~, and contains Cr(+V).
In ammonia solution the dark red-brown compound (NH3)3CrO, is
formed which contains Cr(+IV) (Figure 22.1b).

Tee colour arises from charge transfer (not d—d spectra as Cr(+VI) has
configuration). CrO3 is toxic, and corrosive. The crystal structure
