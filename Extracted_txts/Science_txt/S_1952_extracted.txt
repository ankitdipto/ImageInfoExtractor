MoO, and WOs are formed by heating the metal 9 air They are acidic
‘They are not attacked by acids except HF, but they dissolve in NaOH
forming MoO} and WOI” sons MoOy and WOs differ from CrOy sn
several ways

1 They have almost no oxidizing properties

2 They are insoluble in water

3 Their melting points are much higher (CrO, mp 197°C, MoOs mp
795°C and WO, mp 1473°C)

4 ‘Theircolour and structures are efferent MoO 1s white as expected for
4° but on heating it turns yellow due to the formation of defects in the
solid. The structure s a layer lattice WO 1s lemon yellow in colour,
and has a shghtly distorted thensum oxide ReOy structure of WO,
cctaheda sharing corners in three dinensions (See Figure 23 43 )

Mixed oxides

Several mxed oxides can be made by fusing MoO, or WO, with Group 1

Moist WOs turns slightly blue on exposure to UV light Mild reduction of
aqueous suspensions of MoO, and WO, or acidic solutions of molybdates
‘or tungstates also gives a blue colour The blue oxides’ so produced ate
‘thought to have Mo or W in oxidation states of (+1V) and (+V) and
contain some OH™ instead of OF to balance the charges
