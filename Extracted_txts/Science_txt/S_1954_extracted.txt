Cx(+1V) compounds are alsa rare Ce 1s formed by heating the elentents
a 350°C MoCls exists in two polymere forms, one like NOCI, (see Fire
213) comprising chains of octahedra with the metal atoms displacéd in
pars, forming metal-metal bonds, and the other form without metal~
‘etal bonds

C102 15 made from CrOs by hydrothermal reduction, and has a ruil
(Ti0,) structure ‘The oxide is black in colour and has some metallic
conductwity It 1s also ferromagnetic, and 1s widely used to make hgh
‘quality magnetic recording tapes MoO; and WO; are both made by
reducing the tioxde with hydrogen They are brown-violet in colout and
are insoluble in non oxidizing acids, but dissolve in concentrated HNO,
forming MoO; or WO; The dioxides have a copper-ike lustre and have
dAsstorted rutile structures with strong metal-metal bonds The oxohalide
