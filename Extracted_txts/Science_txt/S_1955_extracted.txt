All the anhydrous CrX; halides are known. CrCl; is a solid which forms
red-violet flakes. The flakiness is related to the layer lattice structure of the
solid, The, chloride ions are cubic close-packed, and to maintain stoichio-
metry one third of the octahedral holes must be occupied by Cr°* ions.
Two thirds-of the holes are occupied in one layer, and none in the next
layer, and “consequently only weak van der Waals forces hold some
chloride layérs together. In aqueous solution the halides form the violet
coloured hexaaqua ion (Cr(H,0),}°*, and halogen complexes such as
{cr(H,0),cIP*, [Cr(H2O)4Ch]* and [Cr(H2O)3Cls]. The hexaaqua ion
also occurs in many crystalline compounds such as [Cr(H2O).]CI; and the
alums. The-alums are double salts; for example chrome alum K2SO,-
Crp(SO,)3-24H2O, which crystallizes from mixed solutions of Cr,(SO4)s
and K,SO,. The structure is better shown'if the formula is written
(K(H,0)6] [Cz"(H20).] [SO.}2. In solution the alums dissociate com-
pletely into simple ions.

The hexaaqua ion is acidic, and it may form a dimer by means of two
hydroxo bridges.

Cr+ ions form an enormous number and variety of complexes. These
are typically six-coordinate with octahedral structures, and are very stable
both as solids and in aqueous solution. The stability is related to the high
crystal field stabilization energy from its d° electronic configuration. The
magnetic moments of these complexes are close to the spin only value of
3.87 BM expected for three unpaired electrons. Complexes include the
hexaaqua [Cr(H,0).]°* and halogen complexes [Cr(H,0);Cl}?*, men-
tioned above. The ammine and oxalate complexes show many different
forms of isomerism, for example the ammine complexes:

[Cr(NH3).}°* only one form

[Cr(NH3)sCl]**— onty one form

([Cr(NH5).Cl2]* cis and trans isomers

[Cr(NH3)3Cls] mer and fac isomers
and in the oxalate complexes:

[Cr(oxalate);]*~ _d and / isomers

Isomerism is discussed more fully in Chaptér 7 (see Figure 7.3). There
are also many cyanide and thiocyanate complexes. Reinecke’s salt
NH,[Cr(NH,)2(NCS),]- H2O is often used to precipitate large positive
tons. This is because when the anion and cation are similar in size, the
