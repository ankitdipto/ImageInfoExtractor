form metal-metal bonds of length 2.76 A. In contrast W(+II1) com-
pounds are unstable. WCl; is really WeCl,g and forms a cluster compound
{WeCha]* structurally like [Nb¢Cl,2]°* (Figure 22.3). WeBrig also forms
a cluster compound, but its structure contains [WeBrg]°* and has the
same structure as [MogBrg]** (Figure 22.4).

Cr(+II) compounds (often called chromous compounds) are well known,
are ionic and contain Cr°*. Solutions containing [Cr(H2O).]’* ,can be
produced either by electrolytically reducing solutions containing Cr°*, or
by reducing them with zinc amalgam. They can also be produced from Cr
metal and acids. The [Cr(HzO),]?* ion is sky blue coloured. It is one of
the strongest reducing agents known in aqueous solution.

Cr*+e>Crt £° = -0.41V

If the solution is acidic Cr?* slowly reduces water to Hy. Cr(+II) com-
pounds are oxidized by air to Cr**. Cr°* is used to remove the last
trace of dioxygen from dinitrogen, and has other uses as a reducing agent.
Cr(+II) may be stabilized by forming coordination compounds, such as
[Cr(NH),°* or [Cr(dipyridyl);]**. Though Cr?* is stable to dispro-
portionation, the dipyridyl complex disproportionates.

Hydrated salts such as CrSO4+7H2O, Cr(ClO,4)2-6H20 and CrCl, -4H,0
an be isolated, but they cannot be dehydrated as they decompose on
eating,

Anhydrous Cr(+II) halides can be made either by reducing the
trihalides with hydrogen at 500°C, or from the metal and HF, HCI, HBr or
1, at 600°C. The dihalides are all readily oxidized in air to the (+III) state
unless protected by an inert atmosphere such as N3. CrCl, is the most
important, and it dissolves in water, giving the sky blue coloured
[Cr(H,0),]** ion. .

Chromium forms many complexes, especially with N ligands and
chelating groups. These are easily oxidized, particularly if moist. Almost
all the complexes are octahedral, and both high-spin and low-spin
complexes are known. The high-spin complexes have the electronic
configuration (t)4)? (e,)'. The asymmetrical filling of the e, orbitals causes
Jahn-Teller distortion similar to that found in complexes of Cu?*.

Chromium(Il) acetate dihydrate Cr2(CH,COO),-+2H,0 is one of the
most stable chromous compounds. It is easily prepared by adding sodium
sretate toa solution containing Cr°* under an atmosphere of N2. Hydrated
wnalerial Ma acetate is precipitated as a red solid. It is a good starting
dimeric A the preparation of other Cr(+II) salts. It has an unusual
distorted ridge structure (Figure 22.5). Each Cr°* is surrounded by a
rou octahedron made up of four O atoms from four bidentate acetate

PS, one O from a H,O molecule, and the other Cr?* ion. The four
