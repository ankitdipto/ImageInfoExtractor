suggested that once a M-M multiple bond has been formed, the metal can
easily be reduced to give a bond of higher order

‘Mo and W do not form difiuondes, but the other six (+1) halides are
known ‘They ate usually made by reduction or thermal decomposition of
higher hahdes They do not exist as simple sons. but form ‘cluster
compounds’ mstead-MoBr 1s really (MogBra|Bra 2430, and all sx of
