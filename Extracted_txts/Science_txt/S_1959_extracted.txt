undergo replacement very slowly. The low oxidation state suggests that
these clusters should oxidize fairly readily. [MogClg]** is only oxidized to
[Mo,C1,,]** (a formal oxidation state of 25), though [WeCls]** is oxidized
to the (W,Cly2]°* cluster (Figure 21.4).

The bonding in these compounds is not settled. The compounds are
diamagnetic; therefore Mo must use all six outer electrons d°s' or W d‘s”
for bonding. Since there are six M atoms there are 36 valence electrons. It
seems probable that eight electrons are used to bond the eight Cl atoms on
the faces, and four electrons are transferred to form four X~ ions. This

leaves 24 electrons to form M—M bonds along the 12 edges of the Me
octahedron. .

(+1) STATE

The oxidation state (+1) expected for the atoms with a d°s! configuration is
Very uncommon. It is doubtful if Cr* exists except when stabilized in a
complex. Trisdipyridy! chromium(1) perchlorate [Cr(dipyridyl)s]* ClOz is
known. Mo and W form’sandwich-type structures such as (CgH,)2Mo* and
CsHsMoC,H, where the metal is in the (+1) state.

ZERO STATE, (-n AND (~II)

The zero oxidation state arises in metal carbonyls such as M(CO)., where
the o bonding electrons are donated by the CO group to the metal, and
Strong dr-pr back bonding occurs from the filled metal orbitals. All three

Ay a The bipyridy! complex [Cr(bipyridyl)3} is also octahedral.
EO real complex dibenzene chromium (Cr(n°-C¢Ho)2] was made by

Tetroe similar to ferrocene, though it is much more air sensitive than
ene. Cr has a coordination number of 12: It was made as follows:
