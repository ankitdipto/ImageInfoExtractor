For work on this and similar organometalhc compounds, Fischer was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry n 1973, yomntly with G Wilkinson
‘who did parallel work on c)clopentadieny] compounds

‘The 1°-CeHs compounds include complexes containing only one cyclo-
pentadienyl ring, and im a similar way complexes are formed with one
benzene ring For example, benzene trcarbonyl complexes for Cr, Mo and
Woeg [Celn-CHe)(CO)s, are yellow solids, the metal has a coordina
tion number of 9 The benzene complexes are more reactive and less
thecmally stable than there n®-CH, counterparts

‘The lower oxidation states occur in carbonyl ions (1) 1m [Mx(CO),0)?",
and (-11) in [M(CO),
