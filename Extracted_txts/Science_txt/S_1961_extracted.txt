also form polyacids, but to a lesser extent. The polyanions contain MoO,
or WO, octahedra, which are joined together in a variety of ways by
sharing corners or edges, but not faces. The polyacids of Mo and W are
divided into two main types:

1, Isopolyacids, where the anions which condense together are all of the
same type — for example all MoOg groups or all WOg groups.

2. Heteropolyacids, where two or more different types of anion
condense together - for example molybdate or tungstate groups with
phosphate, silicate or borate groups.

The isopolyacids of Mo and W are not completely understood. They are
very difficult to study because the extent of hydration and protonation of
the various species in solution is not known. The fact that a solid can be
crystallized from solution does not prove that the ion has that structure or
even exists in solution. The first step in polyacid formation as the pH is
lowered must be to increase the coordination number of Mo or W from 4 to
6 by adding water molecules. The relationship between the stable species
so far known is:

The structures of the paramolybdate and octamolybdate ions have been
