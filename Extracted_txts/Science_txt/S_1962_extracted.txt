Heteropolyions are formed sf a molybdate or tungstate solution 1
acidified in the presence of phosphate, silicate or metal ions ‘The second
anion provides a centre round which the MoO, or WO, octahedta
condense, by sharing oxygen atoms with other octahedra and with the
central group The central groups are often oxoamons stich as PO? Si
compounds, and BO}”, but other elements ncluding Al. Ge, Sn, As, Sb
Se, Te, 1 and many of the transition elements will serve as the second
group ‘The ratio of MoO, or WO, octahedra to FSi B or other cental
atom 1s usually $2 1. 9 I or 6 1, although other ratios occur less
commonly A well known example of heteropolyacid formation isthe test
for phosphates A phosphate solution 1 warmed with ammonium
molybdate and mirc acid, and a yellow precipitate of ammonium
phosphomotybdate (NHa)(PO, Mo;2s9] ts formed

‘The structures of several heteropolyacids have been established In the
12heteropolyacids. for example 12-phosphotungstic acid 12 WO, octa-
hhedra surround a POs tetrahedron This ton may be considered as fout
‘groups of three WO, octahedra (Figure 22 10)
