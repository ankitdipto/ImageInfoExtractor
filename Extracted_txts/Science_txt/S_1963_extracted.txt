The 6-heteropolyacids accommodate larger central atoms, which have a
coordination number of 6. The arrangement of six MoO, octahedra as
shown in Figure 22.11 leaves a central cavity large enough to accept the
octahedron from the hetero atom, and has been found in Ko[TeMogO24].

TUNGSTEN BRONZES

Tungsten bronzes were originally made by strongly heating sodium
tungstate Na,WO, with WO; and H>. They are now made by heating
Na,WO, with W metal, when blue, purple, red or yellow tungsten bronzes
are formed. These are semi-metallic solids which have a lustre and conduct
electricity. They are very inert to both strong acids and strong alkali. They
are used in the production of ‘bronze’ and ‘metallic’ paints.

Tungsten bronzes are nonstoichiometric compounds of formula M,WOs,
where M is Na, K, a Group 2 metal or a lanthanide, and x is always less
than one. The Na* or other metal ions occupy interstitial positions. The
colour depends on the proportion of M present, and for the sodium
compounds: x ~ 0.9 yellow or gold, x ~ 0.7 orange. x ~ 0.5 red, x ~ 0.3
blue-black. The variable amount of Na* produces a defective lattice and
Some of the sites which should be occupied by alkali metals are vacant. It
might be thought that for each Na* removed from NaWO;, one tungsten
would change from W(+V) to W(+VI). The properties of the tungsten
bronzes are better explained by assuming that all the tungsten atoms are in
the (+VI) state. The valency electrons from the alkali metals are free to
ee throughout the lattice, giving metallic conduction. The conductivity
oes with increased temperature, as in a metal. The structure is WO,
