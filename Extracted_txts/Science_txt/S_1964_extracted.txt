‘Molybdenum also forms bronzes similar to those of W, but 4 high
pressure 1s needed to form them, and the Mo compounds are less stable
‘This may be because Mo(-+V) 1 less stable than W(+V), or because the
solid structure 18 different and contains MoO, octahedra joined by 2
muxture of corner and edge sharing with other octahedra Lithium also
forms bronzes, but these do nat conduct electricity

BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE,

‘Trace amounts of Cr and Mo are necessary in the diet of mantmals
r(HI1D) and msulin are both involved in maintaining the correct level of
glucose in the blood In cases of Cr deficiency, glucose 1s only rertoved
from the blood half as fast as normally Some eases of diabetes may select
faulty metabolism of Cr ‘The most amiportant medical aspect of Cr salts &
