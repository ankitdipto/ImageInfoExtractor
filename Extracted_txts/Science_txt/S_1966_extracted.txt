SyTRODUCTION

‘Manganese is produced in very large amounts, most of whuch used in the
steel mdustty Large quanuties of MnO, are also produced, and are used
mainly for making “dry battenes and inthe brick industry ‘KMnO, 1s 2m
:mportant oxidizing agent. Ma(-+Ill) forms a basic acetate with an unusual
structure Mas biologeally important and 1s necessary for photosyathesis
‘The elements technetium and shentum are rarely encountered They difer
from manganese 1m that they have Intle cationic chemistry, therr high
oxidation states are much mote stable. and the oxidation states (+1,
GI) and (+1V) form cluster compounds and compounds with metal-
metal bonds

 

      
     
   
   
     

ABUNDANCE, EXTRACTION AND USES

Manganese 1s the twelfth most abundant element by weight in the earth s
‘crust, and 1s mined as the ore pyrolusite MnO, This 1s a secondary
matenal, which has been formed by alkaline waters leaching Mn from
‘gneaus rocks and depositing it as MaO, World production of Ma ores
‘was 22 7 milion tonnes in 1992, contarning about 9 million tonnes of Ma
‘The largest producers are the Soviet Union 31%, China 25%, South
Afnnca and Brazil 11% each, Gabon 7%, India 6% and Australia 5%
