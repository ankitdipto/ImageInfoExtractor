GROUP? THE MANGANESE GROUP

to precipitate potassium perthenate KReO, The metal 1s obtained by
reducing KReO, or NH,ReOs wth hydrogen World production was only
32 tonnes in 1992. Most of tt used to make Pt~Re alloys which are used
‘as catalysts for making low-lead or lead free petrol for ears Srl amounts
are used as a catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions
Because of sts very high melting point (Table 23 4) 118 used an thermo
couples, electnc furnace windings and mass spectrometer filaments

       
   
   
     

‘OXIDATION STATES

‘The clectrome structure for this group of elements 1s ds? The highest
‘oxidation state of (+Vil) rs obtained when all these electrons are used for
‘bonding Mn shows the widest range of oxidation states of all the elements
rangrag from (III) to (+ VII) The (+I) state 1s the most stable and most
common and Mn** tons exist in the solid in solution and as complexes
However, im alkaline solution Mn** as readily oxdized to MnO; The
(G4IV) state 15 found in the main ore pyrolusite MnO Ma(-+VI) is ell
Known as KMnO, ‘This 1s one of the strongest oxidizing agents known 12
solution, and is stronger than Cr(+VI) m the previous group Mn(+ill)
and Ma(+V1) tend to disproportionate The lower oxidation states extstas
‘earbonyl compounds or as substituted carbonyl complexes

In contrast to the highly oxidizing properties of Mn(-+VI1) the (+Vl)
state ts the most common and most stable for Te and Re Te(+VIl) and
Re(+VIt) show only shght oxidizing properties The (+V1) state tends to
disproportionate and is not well known The (+V) and (41V) states for Te
