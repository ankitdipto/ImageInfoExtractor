and Re have an extensive chemistry. Re(+III) is also stable and the halides
form cluster compounds with metal-metal bonds. The (+II) and lower
oxidation states are uncommon and are strongly reducing. .

Thus on descending the group there is an increase in stability of the
highest oxidation state and also a decrease in stability of the lower states.
The stability of the various states is shown in Table 23.3. The tendency to
disproportionate is shown in the reduction potentials.

GENERAL PROPERTIES

Mn is more reactive than its neighbours in the periodic table. It reacts
Slowly with H,O, liberating Hp, and it dissolves readily in dilute acids. The
finely divided metal is pyrophoric in air, but the massive metal does not
Teact unless heated. When strongly heated the massive metal reacts with
many non-metals such as Oz, Nz, Cl and-F2, forming Mn3O., Mn3N2,

nC, and a mixture of MnF, and MnF3. The melting point of the metal is
“ppreciably lower than for the earlier first row elements Ti, V and Cr. It is
