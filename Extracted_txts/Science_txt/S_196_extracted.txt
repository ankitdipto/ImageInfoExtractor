Mitochondrion

Chloroplasts and mitochondria: Completing an energy cycle. Water and oxygen gas cycle between chloroplasts and mitochondria
within a plant cell, as do glucose and CO. Cells with chloroplasts require an outside source of CO, and water and generate ghucose and
oxygen. Cells without chloroplasts, such as animal cells, require an outside source of glucose and oxygen and generate CO, and water.

The Energy Cycle

The energy-capturing metabolisms of the chloroplasts
studied in this chapter and the mitochondria studied in the
previous chapter are intimately related. Photosynthesis uses
the products of respiration as starting substrates, and respi-
ration uses the products of photosynthesis as its starting
substrates (figure 10.18). The Calvin cycle even uses part of
the ancient glycolytic pathway, run in reverse, to produce
glucose. And, the principal proteins involved in electron
transport in plants are related to those in mitochondria,
and in many cases are actually the same.

Photosynthesis is but one aspect of plant biology, al-
though it is an important one. In chapters 37 through 43,

we will examine plants in more detail. We have treated
photosynthesis here, in a section devoted to cell biology,
because photosynthesis arose long before plants did, and all
organisms depend directly or indirectly on photosynthesis
for the energy that powers their lives.

 

Chloroplasts put ATP and NADPH to work building
carbon-based molecules, a process that essentially
reverses the breakdown of such molecules that occurs
in mitochondria. Taken together, chloroplasts and
mitochondria carry out a cycle in which energy enters
from the sun and leaves as heat and work.
