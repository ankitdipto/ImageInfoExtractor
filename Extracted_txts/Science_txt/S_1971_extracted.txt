Mn resembles iron in its-physical and chemical properties. Mn is harder
and more brittle than iron, but melts at a lower temperature (Mn =
1244°C, Fe = 1535°C). All three metals Mn, Tc and Re are usually
obtained as grey powders, but in the massive form they look like platinum.
Re has the second highest melting point of all the metals (W = 3380°C;
Re = 3180°C).

Manganese is quite electropositive and dissolves in cold dilute non-
oxidizing acids. It is not very reactive towards non-metals at room
temperature, but reacts readily on heating.

Mn is much more reactive than Re. Similar behaviour is observed in
adjacent groups: Cr is more reactive than W, and Fe more reactive than
Os. This decrease in electropositive character is opposite to the trend
shown in the main groups of the periodic table. In addition, Re tends to
attain a higher oxidation state than Mn when they both react with the same
element. A comparison of some of the reactions of Mn and Re is given in
Table 23.5.

Group 7 (manganese group) elements have seven outer electrons, but
the similarity to Group 17 elements, the halogens, is very slight except in
the highest oxidation state. MnO, and Cl,O7 may be compared; MnO;
and ClO are isomorphous and have similar solubilities, and Iz and
ReO; are quite similar. There are much closer similarities between Mn and
its horizontal neighbours Cr and Fe. The chromates CrO3~, manganates
MnO¢~ and ferrates FeQ3~ are similar. The solubilities of the lower oxides
