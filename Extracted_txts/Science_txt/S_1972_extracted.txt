Mn(+I1) salts (often called manganous salts) can easily be made from
‘MnO;
MnO, + 4HCI—+ MnCh + Clp + 2,0
2MnQa + 2H;SO,—> 2MnSO, + 03 + 24,0

Most Mn(+I1) salts are soluble in water and form hydrated Mn** rons,
‘but Mn,(PO,)2 and MaCOs are sparingly soluble (Nin(Hz0)4}* rons are
pink They are also formed by dissolving the metal m acid, or by reducing
hugher oxidation states Small amounts of MaSO, are added to fertizers,
as Mnisan essential trace element for plants Adding NeOH or NH,OH to
2 solution of Mn®* ions gives a very pale pink gelatinous precipitate of
Mn(OH)s, which tums brown=black due to oxidation to MnOz The
standard electrode potentials show that this cannot occur in acid solution
but occurs easily in basie solutions

‘Mn?* has the electronic configuration 34° which corresponds to a half filled
shell Thus Mn?" is more stable than other divalent tons of transition
metals and ts more difficult to oxidize than Cr’* ot Fe’* Most Ma(+!1)
complexes are octahedral and have a high-spin arrangement with five
unpaired electrons (Figure 23 1) This arrangement gives zero crystal field
‘stabilization energy (see Chapter 7) Thus complexes such as [Ma(NH)s}"*
and [MnCl,}*~ are not stable except in solution Complexes wath chelat
ligands are more stable and (Ma(ethylenediamine)s{"* , (Ma(oxalate)s|
and [Mn EDTA} can be isolated as solids

“These complexes all have very pale colours This 1s because a d-d
transition m a high-spin d® complex requires not only the promotion of at
