electron from the tz. level to the ¢, level, but also the reversing of its spin.
The spin selection rule states that when pronioting an electron its spin may
not be changed. The rule is only partially obeyed, but the probability of a
transition where the spin is changed is low. Such transitions are termed
spin forbidden. Because the probability of a spin forbidden transition is
small, the colour is only about one hundredth the intensity of those
observed in most normal spin allowed transitions. (It must also be
remembered that all d~d transitions are forbidden by the Laporte selection
tule. This states that when promoting an electron the change in the
subsidiary quantum number / must be +1, so s— p or p > d transitions are
allowed but not d—> d. This selection rule is less restrictive as it is possible
to get round it if the complex is not symmetrical, or by the mixing of
orbitals, or by thermal motion of the ligands. These are discussed in
Chapter 32.) Details of crystal field splitting of the d levels are given in
Chapter 7.

Strong field ligands may force the electrons to pair up, giving a spin
paired complex. The only common spin paired complex of Mn is
{Mn(CN),*- which has only one unpaired electron (Figure 23.1).
K,[Mn(CN),]-3H2O is blue in colour, and has the same structure as
K,[Fe(CN)«]. Similarly, [Mn(CNR)g]?* and [Mn(CN);- NO]>~ have a spin
Paired or low-spin arrangement with only one unpaired electron. The low-
spin arrangement is a slightly more stable arrangement than the high-spin
case. In the low-spin case the crystal field stabilization energy is five times
4, from filling five electrons into the low energy #2 orbitals. This is partly
cancelled out by the energy needed to pair two electron spins. The low-spin
complexes are more reactive. They can be oxidized very readily because
Temoving an electron removes one unit of pairing energy and thus
Increases the crystal field stabilization energy. These complexes can also
be reduced fairly readily, since adding an electron fills the orbitals
symmetrically.
