ee halide ions may be added to the isolated Re3Xo unit. Halide
ilar such as K*[ResBrio] Ky [ResBry 7 and K3| (ResBry2]°~ can
be obtained from solution. It is also possible to obtain [Re3Xq-3H,0].
The extra ligands L are more labile, i.e. more reactive, than the bridging
wn auite different type of halide complex is formed when perrhenates are
reduced by Hz or sodium hypophosphite NaH,PO, in acid solution. These
contain a dimeric unit [Re,Cls]*~ or [Re2Brg]*~ which is isostructural with
[Mo,Clg] 4-. It is made up of two approximately square planar ReX, units
linked by a Re—Re bond of length 2.24A (Figure 23.4).

 

Figure 23.4 Structure of [Re,Cls]*~ ion.

The metal~metal bond length is very short, and is interpreted as a
quadruple bond. If the Re—Re bond points along the z axis, the square
planar ReX, unit uses the s, p,, Py and dpa_y orbitals for o bonding to the
X atoms. A o bond between the two Re atoms will have contributions
from the p, and d,» orbitals which lie along the axis. With the eclipsed
conformation the d,, and d,, orbitals on the two Re atoms overlap
sideways, forming two x bonds. Finally the d,, orbitals which lie in the
two ReX, planes overlap with each other, giving a 5 bond.

(+IV) STATE

Very few Mn(+IV) compounds are known. However, MnO; is the most
Important oxide in the group, and is commercially important. It is not the
most stable oxide, as it is an oxidizing agent, and decomposes to Mn3O, on
heating to 530°C, MnO, occurs naturally as the black coloured mineral
Pyrolusite, It has the rutile structure which is also found for many other
oxides of formula MO). It can be made as follows:

1, By heating Mn in Oo.

; 8 oxidizing Mn?*, for example by heating Mn(NOs)2-6HO in air.
ay Sty pure MnO; is made by electrolytic oxidation of Mn"SO,.

~ In the laboratory hydrated MnO, is precipitated from solution when

Performing permanganate titrations in alkaline solution.

MnO; + 2H,O + 3e > MnO, + 4O0H- E° = 1.23V
