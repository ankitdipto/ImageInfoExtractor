Hydrated MnO, has some cation exchange properties, and sf it xs de
hydrated if loses some Oz, forming 2 nonstorehtometnie product

‘MnO; does not react with most acids unless heated It dissolves 1
concentrated HCI, but does not form Ma(+1V) in solution Instead it
oxidizes CI t0 Cly, and ts tself reduced to Mn?* Scheele discovered Cl,
using this reaction

MnO; + 4H" + 401 —+ Mni* + 2CI- + Ch + 2H,0

“This was the commercial method of producing Cz until electnety beetme
commercially available and electrolysis became the preferred method Ths
reaction 1 sill used to produce Cl; inthe laboratory af eylinders are not
availanle MnO, oxidizes hot concentrated H,S0, in 3 simular ¥3y,
berating Oz

Ma, 15 formed by direct reaction between Ma and F, It 1s blue
coloured and unstable Its the highest halide formed by Mn A few (+1V)
complexes are also known including K,[MnF4l, Ka{MaCle}. Ke(Mo(CNbL
and K,{Ma(IOy),] This 1s the highest oxidation state an which Ma forms
complexes

Over half a millon tonnes per year of MnO 1s used 1n “dry batees
(Leclanche cells) This must be very pure, and 1s produced electeolyly
(Gee above) Large amounts of MnOs are also used in the brick indus 19
colour bricks red or brown It1s used to make red or purple glass MnO2's
used inthe production of potassium permanganate
