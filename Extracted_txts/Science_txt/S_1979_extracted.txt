MnO, is used as a catalyst in the preparation of dioxygen from KCIO3. If
KCIO; is heated to a temperature of 400-500°C it decomposes and evolves
On. With MnO, present decomposition occurs at 150°C. The product is
contaminated with Cl; or ClO2.

2KCIO; > 2KCI + 30,

The (+IV) state is the second most stable state for both Tc and Re. The
oxides TcO, and ReO, are black and brown respectively, and can be made
in a variety of ways:

1. By burning the metals in a limited amount of dioxygen.

2. By heating the heptoxides M,O, with M.

3, By thermal decomposition of the ammonium salts NH,MO,.

4, The hydrated oxides are conveniently made by reducing solutions of
TcOx or ReO; with Zn/HCI. These may be dehydrated by heating.

TcO, is‘insoluble in alkali, but ReO, reacts with fused alkali, forming
thenites ReO3~. Both oxides have a distorted rutile structure. The metal
atoms in adjacent octahedra are displaced from the centre, giving a
substantial metal-metal interaction like that in MoO, and WO).

The sulphides TcS, and ReS2 are both known. Rhenium sulphides are
effective catalysts for organic hydrogenation reactions, and have the
advantage over Pt that they are not ‘poisoned’ by sulphur compounds.

TcCl, inas a solid structure of TcCl, octahedra linked into a zig-zag chain,
similar to ZrCly. It is paramagnetic, and there are no metal-metal bonds.
All four ReX, halides are known. ReCl, can be prepared as follows:

2ReCls + SbCl; > 2ReCl, + SbCls

It is metastable and reactive, and has a structure based on cubic close-
packed chlorine atoms. The Re atoms occupy one quarter of the octa-
hedral holes but occur in pairs of adjacent octahedra, forming metal-metal
bonds with a Re-Re distance of 2.73 A.

Many complexes are known. [ReCl,}?~ is octahedral, and is obtained by
reduction of KReOg: .
