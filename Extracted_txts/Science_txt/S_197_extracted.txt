The Calvin cycle begins when a carbon
atom from a CO, molecule is added to a
five-carbon molecule (the starting
material). The resulting six-carbon
molecule is unstable and immediately
splits into three-carbon molecules.

 

 

 

Then, through a series of reactions,
energy from ATP and hydrogens from
NADPH (the products of the light
reactions) are added to the three-
carbon molecules. The now-reduced
three-carbon molecules either combine
to make glucose or are used to make
other molecules.

 

Most of the reduced three-carbon
molecules are used to regenerate the
five-carbon starting material, thus
completing the cycle.

How the Calvin cycle works.

Reactions of the Calvin Cycle

In a series of reactions (figure 10.19), three molecules of
CO) are fixed by rubisco to produce six molecules of PGA
(containing 6 x 3 = 18 carbon atoms in all, three from CO
and 15 from RuBP). The 18 carbon atoms then undergo a
cycle of reactions that regenerates the three molecules of
RuBP used in the initial step (containing 3 x 5 = 15 carbon
atoms). This leaves one molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate (three carbon atoms) as the net gain.
The net equation of the Calvin cycle is:
3 CO, +9 ATP + 6 NADPH + water —>

glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + 8 P; + 9 ADP + 6 NADP*

With three full turns of the cycle, three molecules of
carbon dioxide enter, a molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate (G3P) is produced, and three molecules of
RuBP are regenerated (figure 10.20).

We now know that light is required indirectly for differ-
ent segments of the CQ) reduction reactions. Five of the
Calvin cycle enzymes—including rubisco—are light acti-
vated; that is, they become functional or operate more effi-
ciently in the presence of light. Light also promotes trans-
port of three-carbon intermediates across chloroplast
membranes that are required for Calvin cycle reactions. And
finally, light promotes the influx of Mg** into the chloro-
plast stroma, which further activates the enzyme rubisco.
