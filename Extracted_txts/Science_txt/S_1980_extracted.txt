GROUP 7-THE MANGANESE GROUP 1

 

(+¥) STATE
Ma(+-V) 1s hutle known except as the manganate(V) ion MnO3~ (formerly
called hypomanganate) ‘This can be obtained asa bright blue salt K.Mn0,
by reducing an aqueous solution of KMnOs with an excess of sodium
suiphite Its not stable, and tends to disproportionate Te is reluctant (9
form the (+V) state, and Re(-+V) compounds are readily hydrolysed by
water and at the same time they disproportionate

ReClg1s dimen, and has a structure hike (NbCl)z (Figure 21.2) 1m which
two octahedra are joined by an edge The Re-Re distance 1s 3 74A, and
therefore there 1s no metal-metal bonding ‘The oxide Re:Ocs ako
known

(VD STATE,

‘The only example of Mn(+V1) 1s the manganate(V1) 1on MsO#~ These
compounds are sometimes called mangenates, and they are dark green
Manganates are formed by oxidizing MnO; 1n fused KOH with tr, KNO
PbO;, NaBiO, or other oxidizing agents. They can also be obtained by
treating KMnO« wth alkali

Re(+VI) 1s known as the red coloured oxide ReO,, but the existence of
TeOs 1s uncertain ‘The structure of ReOy ss shown in Figure 23 Sa and
the same structure #8 adopted by ather oxides such as WOx Each metals
‘ctahedrally surrounded by oxygen atoms ‘The steucture ws closely related

large cation at the centre of the cube as shown in Figute 23 5b

‘The halides ToF, ReF,and ReClgare known The fluorides are made by
direct reaction of the elements, and the chloride by tceating the fluonde
with BCls They have a d" configuration, and the fuorides ate yellow and
the chlonde is greenblack The magnetic moment 1s lower than the spit
‘only value for d! because of strong spin orbital coupling The compounds
have low mefting points ranging from 18°C to 33°C, and they are senstive
to water

Mn(+VI1) 1s nat common, but 1s very well known as the manganate(V)
ton MnOz, which 1s still commonly called the permanganate 10n The
