potassium salt KMnO, is widely used as an oxidizing agent in both
preparative and analytical chemistry. Titrations are normally carried out
in acidic solutions, and MnOz is reduced to Mn?*, a change of five
electrons.

MnO; + 8H* + 5e— Mn?* + 4H,O E° = 1.51V
In alkaline solution Mn!VO,j is formed, involving a three-electron change.
MnO; + 2H20 + 3e > MnO, + 40H™ 'E° = 1.23V

Thus the reaction which occurs, and hence the stoichiometry, depend on
the pH. The purple colour of MnO; acts as its own indicator in titrations.

Permanganate solutions are intrinsically unstable in acidic solution, and
decompose slowly. Decomposition is catalysed by sunlight, so KMnO,
solutions should be stored in dark bottles and they must be standardized
frequently.

4MnO; + 4H* > 4MnO, + 30, + 2H,0
If a small quantity of KMnO, is added to concentrated H2SO,, a green
solution containing MnO} ions is formed.
KMnO, + 3H,SO,—> K* + MnO + 3HSO7 + H3;0*
With larger amounts of KMnO,, an éxplosive oil MnO; is formed. (Do

not try this.)
KMnO, is manufactured on a large scale:

Permanganates can also be prepared by treating a solution of Mn?* ions
with very strong oxidizing agents such as PbO, or sodium bismuthate
