‘GROUP T “THE MANGANESE GROUP |

[NaBiO, In quahtatve analysis the presence of manganese 1 confirmed by
treating the solution with sodium brsmuthate, when the purple colour of
MnOz 1s obtained Permanganites can also be made by acidifying
‘manganates, when they dispropo tionate to MnOz and MnO>, but the
snelds are not good

"The permanganate son has an intense purple colour Mn(+Vil) has a
configuration, so the colour anses from charge transfer and not ftom
ded spectra

KMnO, 1s used as an osiduing agent in many orgame preparations
including the manufacture of saccharin, ascorbic eexd (vntamun C), and
nicotine acid (niacin) IC as also used for treating drinking water (t
‘oxidizes and thus kalls bacteria, but does not leave an unpleasant taste as
does Cl)

In contrast to the scarcity of Ma(+VH) compounds Te(+Vil) and
Re(+Vil) occur in several compounds These include the heptoxides
MO), heptasulphides MyS;, MOz 10ns oxohalides, 2 hydnde complex
MHZ" and Ref, These are only slightly oxidizing and are relatively stable
compounds

‘The oxides Te,Oz and Re;Oy are formed when the metals are heated in
‘air or dioxygen ‘They are both stable yellow solids Te:O7 melts at 120°C
‘and RezOy at 220°C. in contrast to Mn;0; which san explosive ot! Té0;
1s more oxidizing than ResOy

Both oxides dissolve n water and form colourless solutions of pertechne
acid HT¢O, or perthentc acid HReOs A second form of perthemte sed
exists ts HiReOx (compare with periodic acid HIO, and HslO.) The per
acids are strong acids te completely sonized in aqueous solution The
solubilities of pershenates are simular to those of perchlorates The rons
MnO7. TeOF and ReOF are all tetrahedral The MnOz 10m 18a powerful
oxidizing agent TeOx and ReOy show mild oxdizing properties The

sulphides TesS, and ResSy

‘Whilst MnOz 15 unstable in alkaline solution TeOT and ReO7 ate
stable from bases

KMnO, sa very datk purple—black solid The MnOz som 1s deep purple

the UV region However solutions of HReO, become yellow-green whet
they are concentrated and HTcO, has been isolated asa red solid These
colours anise because the tetrahedral ReOT son becomes less symmetnica
when undhstociated HO—ReOuis formed and the Raman spectrum of te
‘concentrated solution shows lines due to the acid

‘The elements inthis group do not form binary hydtides However, when
potassium pertechnafe KTeO, or potasstum perthenate KReOs is treated
with potassium in ethylenediamine or ethanolic solution, hydrido com
plexes Ks[TeHo] and K,{ReHy] are formed The structure isa tn capped
