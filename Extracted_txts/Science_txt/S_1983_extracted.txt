Figure 23.6 Structure of the enneahydridiorhenium(VII) ion [ReHo]*~

each of the three rectangular faces (Figure 23.6). The proton magnetic
resonance spectrum of this ion rather surprisingly shows a single sharp line.
This suggests that the H atoms are equivalent. This suggests that the H
atoms undergo a very rapid intramolecular site exchange.

When Re is heated with fluorine ReF7 is formed, but Tc only forms
TcF,. ReF, and IF, are the only heptahalides known throughout the
periodic table, and both have a pentagonal bipyramid structure. Several
oxohalides can be made by treating the oxides with the appropriate
halogen, or ReF; with dioxygen or water. These include ReOFs, ReO2F3,
ReQ;F, ReO3Cl, TcO3F and TcO3Cl. The oxohalides aré all pale yellow
or colourless compounds which are either low-melting solids or liquids.

BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE

Mn" is important in both animal and plant enzymes. In mammals the
enzyme arginase is produced in the liver. This is important because it
converts nitrogenous waste products into urea in the ornithine—arginine-
citrulline cycle (discovered by Hans Krebs who also discovered the
tricarboxylic acid cycle). The urea is carried by the blood to the kidneys,
where it is excreted in urine.

Mn is an essential trace element for plant growth. It is added to
fertilizers in parts of the world where there is a deficiency in the soil. It is
essential in a group of enzymes called phosphotransferases.
