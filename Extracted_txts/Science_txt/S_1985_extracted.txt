IRON, COBALT AND NICKEL GRouPS

Iron Fe Cobalt Co Nickel Ni
Ruthenium Ru Rhodium Rh Palladium Pd
Osmium Os Iridium Ir Platinum = Pt

These nine elements made up Group VIII in the old Mendeleev periodic
table. They are now treated as Groups 8, 9 and 10 (in vertical groups or
triads) in the same way as the other transition elements:

Group § Group9 Group 10

 

However, the horizontal similarities between these elements are greater
than anywhere else in the periodic table except among the lanthanides. As
a consequence of the lanthanide contraction, the second and third rows
of transition elements are much’ alike. Because of this, the horizontal
Similarities are sometimes emphasized by considering these nine elements
as two horizontal groups: the three ferrous metals Fe. Co and Ni, and the
six Platinum m metals Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Irand Pt.
