ABUNDANCE, EXTRACTION AND USES

trom isthe fourth most abundant efement in the earth s crust after 0, S
and Al_It makes up 62000 ppm or 6 2% by weight of the earth’ erst
where itis the second most abundant metal (Appendix A) In addition won
and nickel make up most of the earth s core

‘The chief ores are haematite FeyOx, magnetite FeO,, limonite
FeO(OH) and siderite FeCO, (Smaller amounts of pyrites FeS, are also
found ‘This has a yellow metalhe appearance and 1 called ‘Tools gold
because 1 has been mistaken for gold ) World production of won ores was
959 mullon tonnes i 1992. The largest sources are China 22%, the Sovet
Union 18%, Brazil 16%, Australia 12%, and the USA and India 6%
‘each This yielded 497 ela tonnes of pig com x4 1992

Rutheniura and osmium ase very'rare. They are found an the metallic
state together with the platinum metals and the comage metals (Cv. AB|
and Au) ‘The mam sources are traces found inthe NiS/CuS ores mined 1)
South Africa, Canada (Sudbury, Ontario), and the Soviet Union (the
iver sand from the Ural mountains) World production of all six platinum
group metals was only 281 tonnes in 1992 ‘The largest sources were South
