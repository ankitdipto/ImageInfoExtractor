containing les than 2% C are called steel Steels ductie und can be rolled
‘or machined into shape The hardness and strength smcrease wih
Increasing C content The most common forms are mild steel (otherwise
called soft steel or low carbon steel) and hard steel (otherwase called ah
carbon steel)
“The source of the ampunties n pig tron are as follows C arises from the
coke used in the blast furnace Si, P and S arse from the reduction by Cot,
siliates phosphates or sulphates present in the ore. or from Sn the coke
‘Small ariounts of Ma are often found in tron ore, but for most purposes
this 1s beneficial rather than harmful as small amounts of Mn actualy
enhance the physical properties of the metal Typncat analyses of pig ron
and mild steel are shown 1n Table 24 3
