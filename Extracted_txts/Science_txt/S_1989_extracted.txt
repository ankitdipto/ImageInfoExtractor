A modern blast furnace may be 120 feet (40 metres) high, and 50 feet
(15 metres) in diameter at the bottom, and can produce 10000 tonnes of
pig iron per day.

STEEL MAKING

Steel is made by removing most of the C and other impurities from pig
iron. The process involves melting, and oxidizing the C, Si, Mn and P in
the pig iron so that the impurities are given off as gases or converted into
slag.

Puddling

Originally steel was made by ‘puddling’, which involved mixing molten pig
iron with haematite Fe;O,, and burning off all the C and other impurities
to give wrought iron. Wrought iron has had all the C removed and is fairly
soft, and is extremely malleable. It can be converted into steel by adding
the required amount of C or other metals to give the type of steel required,
but this process is now entirely obsolete.

Bessemer and Thomas procésses

In 1855 H. Bessemer (a Frenchman living in England) patented the process
named after him which uses a Bessemer converter. This is a large pear-
shaped furnace lined with silica. The furnace can be tilted and whilst it is in
the horizontal position molten pig iron is poured in. It is then tilted to the
Vertical position and a blast of compressed air is blown through holes in the
bottom of the furnace and through the molten metal. This burns the Si and
Mn in the pig iron to give first SiO, (then iron silicate) and manganese
oxide slag. These reactions produce a lot of heat which leads to stronger
oxidation of C to CO or CO). The course of the reaction can be followed
by burning the waste gases and observing the colour or the spectrum of the
flame Produced. When the C content is sufficiently low, the converter is
Upped and the molten steel is poured into cast iron moulds. This gives an
Mgot of steel, which can be rolled or forged. The process typically takes 20
Tainutes for a 6 tonne ingot of metal.
Tron ores typically contain either Si or P as impurities, which are
oxidized to SiO, or PyOj9. A phosphorus content of over 0.05% in steel
