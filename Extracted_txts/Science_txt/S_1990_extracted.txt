does not remove phosphorus so satisfactory steel or wrought ion can
only be obtained from pig ron containing litle or no P. Furthermore the
phosphorus damages the luting of the convertor, and this can only be
replaced by taking the convertor out of use

process patented by § G ‘Thomas mn 1879) used mstead There are 1W0
‘ifferences from the normal Bessemer process

1 The Thomas convertor 1s lined with a basic material such as calcined
: (strongly heated) dolomite or hmestone This reduces reaction between
‘the 1ron phosphate slag and the lirang of the convertor This profongs

2 Limestone CaCO or lime CaO are added as slag formers. These are
basic and react wath PaOjo forming basic slag Cax(PO.);_ thus

finely ground and sotd as a phosphate fertiizer

‘Thus a Bessemer convertor with its sitate lining was used for sron ore
containing silicate impurities and Thomas convertor hned wath hmestone

Bessemer process reduced the price af steel by a factor of 5 in the UK It

‘War 1 and was stil used in England until the 19605

 

 

  

‘Stemens open hearth process

‘The open hearth process was invented by Sit Willram Siemens soon after
the Bessemer process was invented The furnace required external heating
‘by burning gas or ost m air Molten pig sron was put m a shallow hearth
and the impurities were oxtdized by arr The lining of the furnace Was
acidic oF basie depending on the impurities in the pig won This proces,
replaced the Bessemer process in many places The open hearth process 8
slow and took about 10 hours to convert 350 tonnes. For this reason it has
largely been replaced by the basic oxygen process

Siemens also patented an eleetne ate furnace 1678. Heat 1s provided
