Phase diagram
“The ron-carbon phase diagram is very complicated and is described under
“Intersutil alloys and related compounds’ m Chapter 5 The producionof|
alloys contamning small amounts of V, Cr, Mo, W or Mn gives steels with
special properties for particular purposes

Production figures and uses

World production of steel ingots and castings was 717 million tonnes in
1992 The largest steel producing countries were the Soviet Union 6%,
Japan 14%, the USA 12% and China 11% The largest use 1s 3 mild set
for ship building, guders and motor car bodies Muld steel 1s malleable
and can be bent or machined It can also be hardened (tempered) by
heating to red heat and quenching (coolmg rapidly) by plunging ito
water or oil In a year, 14 million tonnes of tn plate, re thin sheets of|
ruild steel electroplated with a very thin protective layer of tn are wed
for packaging food and other materals as ‘tin cans’. Several ferrous alloys
are produced in large amounts. ferrosilicon 3.5 mullion tonnes/year
ferrochrome 3 1 milion tonnes/year, ferromanganese 3 4 malon tonnes!
year and ferronicket 569000 tonnes/year

Promoted iron 1s used as the catalyst sn the Haber~Bosch process for
‘making NH

EXTRACTION OF RUTHENIUM AND OSMIUM

Ru and Os ate obtained from the anode shme which accumulates 1 the
electrolytte refining of Ni This contains a muxture of the platinum metal
together with Ag and Au The elements Pd, Pt, Agand Au are dissolved
aqua regia and the residue contains Ru Os, Rh and Ir After a complex
separation Ru and Os are obtained as powders, and powder fotMig
‘techniques are used to give the massive metal ‘These elements ar¢ both
scarce and expensive Ru 1s used to alloy with Pd and Pt, and Os abo
used to make hard alloys. All ofthe platinum metals have specific eatsyte
properties

 

OXIDATION STATES

In the previous groups of transition elements (Groups 3~7), the maximum
‘oxidation number was attained when all of the valency electrons 1n the
and s levels were used for valency purposes If this trend contnved thet
the maxumum oxidation number for Group 8 would be (+VIII) However,
this trend 1s not continued in the second half of the d block and the
Iughest oxidation state for Fe 1s (VI) This state ss rare and 1s of Mle
importance

‘The main oxidation states for Fe are (+11) and (+111) Fe(-+H1) tb
