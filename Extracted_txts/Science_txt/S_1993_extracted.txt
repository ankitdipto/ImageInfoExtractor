most stable, and exists in aqueous solution. Fe(+III) is slightly oxidizing,
but the Fe(+II) and Fe(+III) states are much closer in stability than has
been found in previous groups. In marked contrast the elements Ru and Os
form RuO, and OsO, which are in the (+VIII) state. Ru(+III) and
Os(+IV) are the most stable states, though Ru(+¥), Os(+VI) and
Qs(+ VIII) are also reasonably stable. Thus the usual trend is observed
that on descending a group, the higher oxidation states become more
stable. The stability of the various oxidation states is shown by the range of
oxides and halides which are known (see Table 24.5).

GENERAL PROPERTIES

Pure iron is silvery in colour, is not very hard, and is quite reactive (see
Table 24.6). The finely divided metal is pyrophoric. Dry air has little effect
on massive Fe, but moist air quite quickly oxidizes the metal to hydrous
Ton({I1) oxide (rust). This forms a non-coherent layer which flakes off, and
&xposes more metal to attack. Iron dissolves in cold dilute non-oxidizing
acids, forming Fe?* and liberating hydrogen. If the acid is warm and if air
‘present some Fe** ions are formed as well as Fe?*, whilst oxidizing acids
oa only Fe**. Strong oxidizing agents such as concentrated HNO; or
oot? passivate the metal because of the formation of a protective coat
able tO 7 this layer is scratched, the exposed metal is once again vulner-
dtu chemical attack. Fe is slightly amphoteric. It is not affected by
'¢ NaOH, but it is attacked by concentrated NaOH.
