In contrast Ru and Os are noble, and ate very resistant to attack by
acids However, Os 1s oxidized to O50g by aqua regi

“The rusting of om 1s a special case of corrosion, and 15 of great practical
importanee The process 1s very complex, but a simphfied explanation s
that Fe atoms are converted to Fe? 1ons and electrons. The electrons
rove to a more noble metat which may be present as an ymporty inthe
twon, oF contact with tt The electrons discharge H tons present inthe
water, forming hydrogen, which reacts with atmosphenc dioxygen to pe
water

‘The ron becomes positive and forms the anode, and the noble metal serves
as the cathode, 1e small local electrochemical cells are formed in the
surface The Fe* sons are subsequently oxidized to Fe(+IM), either
FeO OH, FeO, or FesO, Since the oxide does not form a coherent
protective film, corrosion continues

‘To prevent corrosion, O;, HO and the impunties must be excluded In
practice Fe 1 often given’ a protective coatmg to exclude the water
Electroplating Fe with a thin layer of Sn xs widely used and 14 mulhon
tonnes of ‘un plate’ were produced in 1991, Other methods include ‘bot
aipping’ the Fe m molten zinc, galvanizing (electroplating with 25)
Sherardiaing, and painting with fed lead Another effective treatment 8
to convert the outer layer of iron into iron phosphate This may be done
by treating with phosphone acid or acid solutions of Ma(H;POs): oF

sacrificial anode may be used which makes the iron the cathode 1 the
