the periodic table: hence the similarities between the second and third row
elements are not so close as are found in the earlier transition groups (see
Table 24.7). The close horizontal similarities in the ferrous metals and in
the platinum metals are largely due to the similarity of their atoms and ions
in size (e.g. Fe’* 0.61A (low spin), Co?* 0.65A (low spin) and Ni**
0.69 A). Because osmium is only a little larger than ruthenium, it would be
expected to have a much higher density and indeed Os is the second most
dense element known (density 22.57gcm~>) exceeded only by a small
margin by Ir (density 22.61 gcm7>) (see Appendix D).

LOW OXIDATION STATES

The (-II) state is rare, but occurs in the carbonyl ions [Fe(CO),]*~ and
[Ru(CO),}-. The zero-valent state occurs in the carbonyls, which may be
mononuclear, ¢.g. Fe(CO)s, Ru(CO)s and Os(CO)s, dinuclear, e.g.
Fe,(CO)o and Os,(CO)o, or trinuclear, e.g. Fe3(CO)32, Rus(CO);2,
0s,(CO), (Figure 24.2).

Fe(CO)s, Ru(CO); and Os(CO)s are liquids at room temperature. The
other carbonyls are volatile solids. Fe(CO)s is available commercially. The
di. and trinuclear carbonyls contain M—M bonds. Fe,(CO), has three
bridging CO groups joining the two metal atoms, but in Os2(CO)g there is
probably only one bridging group. Fes(CO);2 has two CO bridges between
one pair of Fe atoms, whilst Os;(CO),. has no bridging groups.
FezRu(CO)j2 has the same structure as Fe3(CO);2, but FeRua(CO);2 has
the same structure as Os3(CO);2.

Fe(CO)s is oxidized quite easily, and the gas forms an explosive mixture

with air. These carbonyls react with aqueous alkali or water, forming
carbonylate anions:

Fe(CO); + 3NaQH —> Na{HFe(CO),] + Na,CO3 + H,0

me undergo substitution reactions with other ligands such as PF3, PCl3,
> AsPhs and unsaturated organic molecules such as benzene. In the

Polynuctear carbonyls the metal-metal bond and the metal cluster are
often Tetained,

Fe(CO)s + PF; > (PF);Fe(CO), + CO
Fe2(CO), + 6PPh3 > Fe,(CO)3(PPH3). + 6CO
