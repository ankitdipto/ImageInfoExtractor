An unusual derivative RugC(CO),7 contains a distorted octahedral cluster
of six Ru atoms with a carbon atom at the centre (similar to the
arrangement in interstitial metal carbides), but four of the Ru atoms have
three terminal CO groups and the remaining two Ru atoms have two
terminal CO groups and one bridging CO. .

The complex [Fe(H.0);NO}** is formed in the ‘brown ring’ test for
nitrates. The colour is due to charge transfer. This complex formally
contains Fe(+1) and NO*. Its magnetic moment is approximately 3.9 BM,
confirming the presence of three unpaired electrons.

(+11) STATE

Iron(+I1) is one of the most important oxidation states, and salts are often
called ferrous salts. They are well known as crystalline compounds. Most
are pale green and contain the [Fe(H.O),]?* ion, for example FeSO, -7H20,
FeCl>-6H2O and Fe(ClO,)2-6H2O. The [Fe(H2O),]?* ion exists in
aqueous solutions. Iron(II) compounds are easily oxidized, and so are dif-
ficult to obtain pure. However, the double salt FeSO, - (NH4)2SO4 + 6H20
is used as a standard compound in volumetric analysis for titrations with
oxidizing agents such as dichromate, permanganate and ceric solutions.
FeSO, and H.O> are used as Fenton's reagent for producing hydroxyl
radicals and, for example. oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes.

Oxides

FeO is nonstoichiometric and is metal deficient. It commonly has the
formula Fey ysO. It may be formed as a black powder by strongly heating
iron(+11) oxalate Fe''(COO), in a vacuum and then quenching to prevent
its disproportionation:

Fe(C,0,) > FeO + CO, + CO
2Fe'O—> Fe,0, + Fe"

FeO dissolves in acids and is completely basic. It has a sodium chloride
type of lattice, comprising a cubic close-packed arrangement of O27 ions
with Fe" ions occupying all (or almost all) of the octahedral holes.
Fe(OH) is precipitated from solutions containing Fe(+II) as a white solid,
but it rapidly absorbs O, from the air and turns dark green and then brown.
This is because it oxidizes first to a mixture of Fe(OH), and Fe(OH). and
then to hydrous Fe,03- (H,0),,. Fe(OH), dissolves in acids. It also
