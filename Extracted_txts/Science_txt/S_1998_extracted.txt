chlorine atoms occupy trans positions

‘Anhydrous Fe and FeCl are made by heating the metal with gaseous
HF of HCI, as heating the elements gives FeFy and FeCl FeBrz and Fel,
are made by heating the elements The anhydrous Fe(+Il) halides react
‘wth gascous NH, forming salts containing the octshedral comple son
[Fe(NHy),P* This complex decomposes in water to give Fe(OH);

‘Complexes

Fe sons form many complexes The most important one 1s haemo
globin (the red pigment in blood) which 1s discussed later tn the section
*Biomorgane chemstty of tron’ Most of the complexes are octahedral
though a few tetrahedral halide complexes (FeX.]?” are formed

Both have been used as pigments in ink and paint Recent X ray work
infrared and Mossbauer spectroscopy have shown that Turnbull s blue

Between Fe(+t) and Fe+Ill) The standard reduction potentials show
‘that i ms easier toronsdize the [Fel"(CN),J*~ ron m aqueous solution to

‘This means that Fe(+ItI) forms a more stable complex with CN” than
does Fe(+I1) Thus ts surprising since CN~ forms x bonds by accepting
electrons from metal ons Fe(-+Ul) has more electrons than Fe(+It), 50
X follows that Fe(+l) should have stronger x bonding and hence shorter
‘bonds than Fe(+IIl) ‘The Fe~C bond lengths of 1 95 A in [Fe!"(CN),)~
and 192A in [Fe"(CN),)*~ confirm this Thermodynamic data show that
AFP for the oxidation of [Fe'!(CN).]‘~ 1s more positive than for the
oudation of [Fe''(H,0),]"*, and the reason why the observed E° values
(and the AG values) ate different 1s largely due to the large negatne
entropy of hydration resilting from the high charge on [Fe'"(CN)]”
‘This shows that the solvent plays an important role, and behaviour inthe
solid and solution are not atways the same
