easily removed or substituted. Though the salt is said not to be poisonous,
care must be taken as it evolves HCN with dilute acids. It is possible to
obtain mono-substitution products by replacing one CN~ by HO, CO,
NO; or NO*. The best known is sodium nitrosopentacyanoferrate(II)
Na2[Fe(CN)s(NO)] - 2H20, which is usually called sodium nitroprusside.
This complex has NO* as a ligand, and is formed as brown—red crystals by
reacting a hexacyanoferrate(II) with either 30% HNO; ar with a nitrite:

[Fe(CN),|*" + NOx + 4H* > [Fe(CN)<(NO)?~ + NH + CO,
Na,[Fe(CN),] + NOz + H2,0 > Na,[Fe(CN);(NO)] + 2NaOH + CN7

Sodium nitroprusside reacts with sulphide ions to give a purple complex
[Fe(CN),(NOS)}". This is used as a sensitive qualitative test for
sulphides.
2[Fe(CN),(NO)}?~ + S?- > 2[Fe(CN)s(NOS)]*~

Other stable complexes are formed with bidentate ligands such as
ethylenediamine, 2,2'-dipyridyl and 1,10-phenanthroline (formerly called
ortho-phenanthroline (Figure 24.3). The latter complex [Fe"(phen)3]** is
bright red, and is used for the colorimetric determination of iron, and also
as the redox indicator ‘ferroin’ in titrations. It is easier to oxidize
[Fe(H,0),|°* to [Fe(H.O),]°* than it is to oxidize [Fe(phen)3]** (red
colour) to [Fe(phen)3]** (blue colour). Thus the red colour persists until
there is excess oxidizing agent present. The greater stability of the iron(II)
phenanthroline complex is due to 1 bonding between the metal and low

energy n* antibonding orbitals on the ligand. Similar stabilization also
occurs in the dipyridyl complex.

Fe* has a d® electronic configuration, and octahedral complexes with
weak field ligands have a high-spin arrangement with four unpaired
electrons (Figure 24.4a). Strong field ligands such as CN~ and 1,10-
phenanthroline cause spin pairing. This makes them more stable because
they have a larger crystal field stabilization energy (Figure 24.4b). Spin
Pairing also results in the complexes being diamagnetic.

The brown riag test for nitrates and nitrites depends on forming a brown
complex [Fe(H2O);-NO}*. In this test a freshly prepared solution of
FeSO, is mixed with the solution containing NOz or NO} ions in a test
tube, Concentrated H,SO, is run down the side of the tube so that the acid
forms a layer at the bottom. The H2SO, reacts with NOZ, forming NO,
Which combines with Fe?*, slowly forming the brown complex [Fe(H20)s-
NO}** at the interface between the two liquids. If the mixture gets hot or is

shaken the brown colour disappears, NO is evolved and a yellow solution
