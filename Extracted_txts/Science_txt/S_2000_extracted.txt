In addition to these octahedral complexes the heavier halides form
crystalline complexes [Fe'"X<]?~ These are tetrahedral complexes an are
formed only with large cations The presence of a large anon and a ltge
cation gies a Ingh latice energy

There are few simple compounds of Ru(+M) and Os(+11), though
