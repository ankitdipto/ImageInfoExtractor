complex can be made by reducing an aqueous solution of RuCl; with
hydrazine sulphate or by treating [Ru!""(NH3)s+ H2O]** with NaN3. The
reaction where H,O is replaced directly by No is of greatest interest, since
this might be closer to how bacteria fix atmospheric dinitrogen.

Terminal N2 ligands have a strong IR band in the range 1930-2230cm™'.
This compares with a band at 2331cm™! in Nz gas. The IR band may be
used to show that a dinitrogen complex has been formed, and the lowering
of the wavenumber shows x bonding has occurred from Ru to N, thus
reducing the N—N bond order. Thus Nz is acting as a m acceptor ligand.
Nz is a weaker o donor and a weaker x acceptor than CO, and hence
dinitrogen complexes are not very stable. Complexes of other metals
including Mo, Fe and Co can also take up Nz at atmospheric pressure,
particularly with tertiary phosphine ligands:

FeCly + No + 3PEtPhy "5, FeH(No)(PEtPh.);

The Nz ligand may also act as a bridging group:
[Ru(NH5)s-N2]** + [Ru(NHs)s- H,O]**
— [(NH;),* Ru—-N—N—Ru - (NH3)<]**

In the dinuclear complex the N—N bond is 1.24A, only slightly longer
than the distance of 1.098 A in N>. The interest in complexes which can
coordinate dinitrogen arises from the possibility of dinitrogen fixation (see
also Chapter 20). Dinitrogen complexes have also been made for all of the
metals in Groups 7, 8 and 9 (Mn, Fe and Co groups), together with Mo and
Ni. The complexes typically contain the metal in a low oxidation state,
often with phosphine or hydride ligands such as (RsP)2Ni - N2- Ni(PR3)2
and (R3P)3-Fe-N-H . Since the Nz molecule is symmetrical and has
zero dipole moment, o bonding from N to the metal will be very slight
(hence the very small change in N—N bond length), and back bonding
from the metal to m orbitals on the nitrogen is the main interaction.

(+l) STATE

Fe(+IIl) is a very important oxidation state. Salts are often called ferric
salts, and are obtained by oxidizing the corresponding Fe(+II) salts.
Fe(+III) solutions are frequently yellow—brown, but the colour is due to the
presence of colloidal iron oxide, or FeO - OH. Fe(+III) forms crystalline
falls with all the common anions except I~, and many of the salts exist in
Peay ae arous and hydrated forms. These have a variety of colours:
én ¢ wa ete es HO and Fe,(SO,)3-9H,O are yellow; FeBr3-
oko ard Fel 3 are green; Fe(NO3)3-6H20 is colourless; and Fe(NO3)3-
