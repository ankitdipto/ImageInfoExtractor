land erystalize easily They also contain [Fe(HzO)6P* The best known
are ammonium fern alum (NH,)[Fel"(H;0)ql[SOs]2+ 6H 0 and potash
alum [K(H,O)l[Fe"™(H,O)s[SOx]2 Like the chrome alums, these are
used as mordants in the dyeing mdustry

Oxides and hydeated oxides

There 16 no evidence that Fe(OH), exists Hydrolysis of FeCh does not
give the hydroxide but gwves a red-brown gelatinous precipitate of the
Iydrous oxide Fe,Ox(H;0),, At least part of this preciprlate consists of
FeO-OH Heating the hydrous oxide t0 200°C gives red-brown a Fe,01
‘The structure comprises a hexagonally close packed lattice of OF rots
with Fe'® tons in two thirds ofthe octahedral holes However, if Fe,0,'5
