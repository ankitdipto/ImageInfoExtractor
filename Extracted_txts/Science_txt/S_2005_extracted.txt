c (HIV) STATE

mixture of [Fe(SCN)(H20)s]** and also some Fe(SCN)3 and [Fe(SCN).]~.
The colour may also be used for the estimation of iron(II). This colour is
destroyed by the addition of F~ ions, because [FeF,]>~ is formed.

Fe?* has ad’ electronic configuration. Thus complexes with weak field
ligands will have a high-spin arrangement with five unpaired electrons.
Thus d-d spectra will be ‘spin forbidden’: hence the absorption will be
very weak. Mn2* also has a d° electronic arrangement and also has very
weak d-d spectra. However, Fe(+III) has an extra charge and is more
able to polarize the ligands, thus giving intense charge transfer spectra not
found in Mn?*. The only complex which actually shows the weak d—d
bands is [Fe(H2O),]**. The hydrolysed species have charge transfer bands
which mask the d—d spectra. Strong field ligands such as CN”, SCN~ and
oxalate form complexes with Fe** which have a spin paired arrangement
(Figure 24.5b). These would be expected to show reasonably intense
colours from d—d spectra, but these colours too are masked by charge
transfer.

Fe(+III) and Ru(+III) form basic acetates of the type |[Fe;0
(CH;COO)¢L3]*. The structure consists of a triangle of three Fe atoms
with an O atom at the centre. The six acetate groups act as bridges between
the Fe atoms, two groups across each edge of the triangle. Thus each Fe
atom is linked to four acetate groups and the central O, and the sixth
position of the octahedron is occupied by water or another ligand. This
type of carboxylate complex is formed by the trivalent ions of Cr, Mn, Fe,
Ru, Rh and Ir.

Ruthenium and osmium

In the (+III) state, Ru complexes are more numerous than those of Os.
Both elements form [M'(NH3),]°*, and Ru forms a range of mixed
halogen—ammonia complexes. If RuO, is added to concentrated HCI and
evaporated, a dark red material formulated RuCl, +3H2O is formed. This
is readily soluble in water, and is the starting point of many preparations. It
scems to contain not only Ru’ species but also some polynuclear Ru'Y
species. Ru(+IH) chloro species catalyse the hydration of alkynes.

RuC+) forms a basic acetate similar to [Fes,O(CH;COO),L3]* described
above.

(+IV) AND HIGHER STATES

Burning Ru or Os metals in air gives RuO, as a blue-black solid and OsO2
as a coppery coloured solid. Both oxides have rutile (TiO,) structures. Os
forms a stable tetrafluoride and tetrachloride.

(+V) STATE

The (+V) state is unstable, and is found only as the pentafluorides, which

are tetrameric with bridging F groups as in NbF, and TaF. i
r see Figure
21.1). Fluoride complexes are also known. ° ° ®
