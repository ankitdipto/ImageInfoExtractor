RuO, and OsO, are yellow coloured volatile solids wath melting potas of
25°C and 40°C respectively OsO, 1s made either by burning finely drvided
metal in Op, or by treating it with concentrated HNO; RuOs 1s less stable
and is formed by oxidation with permanganate or bromate in H;SO. Both
oxides are toxic, smell like ozone and are strongly oxidizing They have
tetrahedral structures Both are shghtly soluble in water but very soluble in
