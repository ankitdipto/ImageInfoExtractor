‘Haemoglobin has a molecular weight of nearly 65000 and ws made up of
four subunits Each subunit comprises « porphyrin complex haem (Figue
24 8) which contains Fe” bonded to four N atoms, and a globular proten
called globin The globular protein 1s coordinated to the Fe? yt haem
through a fifth N atom from 2 histidine molecule in the protein The sah
position round the Fe" 3s occupied enther by a dhoxygen molecule or 2
water motecule

In oxyhaemoglobin the Fe?* 1s un the fow-spin state and ws diaagnet

‘The porphyrins both planar and rigid In deoxyhaemogtobin the Fe” in
the high spun state ands paramagnetic The size of Fo"” increases by 28%
Wher it changes from low spin to high spin 1.e from0 61 A to 7A (see
Table 247) Thus in deoxyhaemoglobia the Fe?* 1s 100 large to ft the
hole at the centre of the porphyrin, and 1s stuated 07-0 8A above the
ring, thus distorting the bonds round the Fe Thus the presence of O>
changes the electromie arrangement of Fe? and also distorts the shape of
the complex The globular protein appears to be essential since iw 8
removed oxidation of Fe(-+I1) to Fe(-+I1)) occurs which 1s not reversible

Hiaemogiobun 1s made up of four subunits, and when one subunit pcs
up an Oy molecule. the Fe* contracts and moves into the plane of the

‘conformational changes in the globin chain Sunce this chan 1s hyd#ogen
bonded to the other three ums it changes their conformations 109 ad
enhances their abiluy to attract O; This phenomenon is called the
cooperanve effect The affinity of haemoglobin for O; decreases asthe pH
decreases, but as blood 1s well buffered this has only a slight effect Ina
similar way when the blood reaches the muscles, once one O3 has been
released the others are released even mote easily due to the coopete
