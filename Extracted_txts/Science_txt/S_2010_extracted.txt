Ferretn

Animals, meluding man, absorb iron as Fe(+I1) from food 1s ther
‘digestive systems Their requirements for Fe are very small man reqites
only Img per day) as the existing Fe i the body 1s reeycled Any won
absorbed immediately reacts to form transferrin A human body contains
about 4g of Fe, roughly 3 as haemoglobin and 1g as ferretin Persea s
found in the spleen, ler and bone marrow When a red blood cel! has
become aged after an average of 16 weeks the haemoglobin 1s broken
down and the tron 1s recovered by transferrin a non haem protein Ths
18 a single chain polypeptide of molecular weight 76000-80000 whch
contains two Fe atoms This transports the Fe to the bone marrow where
115 converted to ferretin which 1 brown and water soluble Ferteun
contains about 23% Fe It consists ofa roughly sphenecal sheath of prota
falledspotertetin which i approximately 120.4 n Oiameter and wth
encloses a micelle of Fe(+IHl) hydronde, oxide and phosphate The
celle 1s an aggregate of particles whose surface bears a charge The
ruicelle contares 2000-5000 atoms of Fe

 

 

Catalases and peronadases

Catalases are enzymes which promote the disproportionation of 1:03
‘They also catalyse the oxidation of substrates by HO, The catslse
molecule contains four Fe(HII) haem b groups and has a molecular
‘weight of about 240000

2H;03 + 2H. + 0;

‘The peroxidases also catalyse the decomposition of H:O> but they a
assocrated with a coenzyme AH which 1s oxidized in the reaction

HsO; + AHy > 2H,0 + A

Ferredoxins

‘These are a group of fon haem iron proteins which are responsible fot
electron transfer en plants and bacteria They setve the same function tat
‘ytochromes perform im animals but ferredoxins have much 10¥et
molecular weights (6000-12000) and they may contain ane two fost OF
‘ight Fe atoms Rubedoxin isthe simplest and contains only one Fe atom S
‘This 1s surrounded by four S atoms from the amino acid eysteme which
linked into protein chains and may be represented Fe(S cysteine). The
four $ atoms are roughly tetrabedral

Other ferredoxins include inorganic sulphide rons as well as eystete $
atoms ¢g Fex(S\(S-cysteime), Since they contain inorgame sulphide
rons treatment with dilute acids iberates HoS

Some bacterial ferredoxins form cluster compounds The simplest
Fe,Sq(S cysteine), The cluster may be imagined as a cube with two FE
atoms at diagonally opposite corners on the top face and two Fe 3:0"
