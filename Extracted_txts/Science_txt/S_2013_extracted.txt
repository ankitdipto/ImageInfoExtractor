cules are pentahaptic, with five C atoms in each ring attached to Ti.
Reduction of these compounds gives [Ti(CsHs)2 - X] or [Ti(CsHs)2]2. Note
that the latter compound is dimeric, and thus has a different structure to
ferrocene.

Ti(CsHs)s is unusual because two cyclopentadienyl rings are pentahaptic
(x bonding) and two are monohaptic (o bonding), i.e. [Ti(m>-CsHs)o(n!-
CsHs)2]. A similar arrangement is found in [Nb(1°-CsHs)2(n!-CsHs)2],
[Nb(1?-CsHs)2(n'-CsHs)2Cl] and [Nb(n°-CsHs)2(n'-CsHs)2Cls).

Other compounds have only one ring, e.g. [Cr(5-CsHs)(CO)3] — , [Mn(q>
CsHs)(CO)s], [Cr(q6-CgHe)(CO)3], [Mo(y?-C7H7)(CO)3]+ and [Fe(n*-
C4H)(CO),}. \

Ferrocene is sometimes regarded as a compound of Fe?* and two CsHs
ions. The bonding in these aromatic sandwich-type structures is better
considered as 7 bonding involving the lateral overlap of the d,, and d,,
orbitals on Fe with the delocalized pa aromatic orbital from each cyclo-
pentadienyl ting. The bonding is too complicated to be described in detail

ere.

The sandwich compounds were discovered and studied independently by
E.O. Fischer in Munich and G. Wilkinson at Imperial College, London.

For this work they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
1973.
