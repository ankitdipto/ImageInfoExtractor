shown in bold. Other well-characterized but less important states are shown
in normal type. Oxidation states that are unstable, or in doubt, are given in
parentheses.

OCCURRENCE, EXTRACTION AND USES

The elements have odd atomic numbers and have low abundance in the
earth’s crust. Co occurs to the extent of 23 ppm by weight, whilst rhodium
and iridium are extremely rare.

earth’s crust, by weight

Co 30 29
Rh 0.0001 T=
Ir 0.001 4

 

There are many ores which contain Co. The commercially important
ones are cobaltite CoAsS, smaltite CoAs, and linnaeite Co3S4. These are
always found together with Ni ores, often with Cu ores and sometimes with
Pb ores. Co is obtained as a by-product from the extraction of the other
metals. In 1992, world production of Co ores was 30100 tonnes of
contained metal. The main producers were Zaire 22%, Canada 17%,
Zambia and the Soviet Union 15% each, and Australia 9%.

The ote is roasted to convert it to a mixture of oxides called ‘speisses’.
As;Oiw and/or SO, come off as gases and are valuable by-products. The
