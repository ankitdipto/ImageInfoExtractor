odes are treated with HjSO, when Fe (which 1s often present as an
smpunty), Co and Nt dissolve and can be separated from Cu or Pb. Limes
adiled tothe solution to precipitate Fe as the hydrous oxide FeO, (#0)
‘Then NaOCl 1s added to precipitate Co(OH). The hydroxide is ignited to
give Co\O« which 1s reduced by heating with H> or charcoal to we Co
metal

Co forms important high temperature alloys with steel and about one
third of the metal produced 1s used for this purpose These alloys find
important uses in gas turbine engines and im high speed stecl which is used
to make cutting tools for lathes High working speeds can be used as these
tools retain their hardness and cutting edge even at red heat Exceptionally
hard alloys ean be made which can be used instead of diamonds in rock
anil, € g stele (50% Co, 27% Cr, 12% W, 5% Fe and 2 5% C) and
‘widia metal (tungsten carbide WC with 10% Coy

‘A third of the Co produced 1s used to make pigments for the cerame
{1058 and paint ndustnes Histoncally the oxide was used as a blue pigment
inthe ceramic industry [tis used to make blue glass Nowadays tismatnly
used to counteract the yellow colour of Fe and give a white colour

Cos ferromagnetic (1 st can be magnetized permanently) tike Fe and
Ni One fifth of the Co produced 1s used to make magnetic alloys such 2s
Alnico (containing Al, Niand Co) These alloys make powerful permanent
‘magnets which are 20-30 umes more powerful than magnets of Fe

Small amounts of the Co salts of fatty acids from linseed oil and
naphthemie acid are used as ‘driers’ to speed the drying of oil paints

Co 1s an essential constituent of fertile soil and 1s present im some
enzymes and mn vitamin Byr

radiation, which 1s used an hospitals for radiotherapy of cancerous
tumours "Co ss prepared by neutron srradiaion of the only naturally
curring sotope *"Co in a nuclear reactor
