LOWER OXIDATION STATES

The oxidation states (—I) and (0) occur in a few compounds with T bonding
ligands such as CO, PF;, NO and CN™. The (-1) state is found in the
tetrahedral complexes [Co(CO),]-, [Rh(CO)4]~, [Co(CO);NO] and
K[Ir(PF;)s]. The zero oxidation state occurs in Co2(CO)s, though there is
some doubt about the corresponding Ru compounds (Figure 25.1). Other
zero-valent compounds are K4[Co(CN),] and [Co(PMes),].

Figure 25.1 Two isomeric forms of Co2(CO)g, both with metal-metal bonding.

The carbonyls Cos(CO),2, Rhg(CO),2 and Irs(CO),2 all have M—M
bonds and contain a cluster of four metal atoms. The CO groups may be
either apical (terminal) or bridging. There are slight differences between
compounds of the metals. The Co and Rh compounds have three bridging
CO groups but the Ir compound has none (Figure 25.2).

The carbon)

yl ion from Na3[Cog(CO),4] and the carbonyls Cog(CO)16
and Rhe(CO)ig have unusual structures, comprising an octahedral cluster
SIN metal atoms with a CO group bridging three metal atoms on each

triangular face of the octahedron. The remaining CO groups are normal
terminal groups.
