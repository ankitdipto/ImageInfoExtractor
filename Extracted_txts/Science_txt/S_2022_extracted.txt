‘The (+11) state 1s the most important for simple compounds of Co (though
the (+111) state s the most rmportant m complexes). Rh(+1N) and fr(+11)
are only of minor importance

‘A wade range of simple Co( +11) compounds are known including CoO
Co(OH). CoS. and salts of the common acids such as CoCl, CoB,
CoSOx, Co(NOr)- and CoCOy The hydrated salis are all pink or red and
contain the hexahydrate 10n [Co(H,0),]°* Most Co(+Il) compounds
