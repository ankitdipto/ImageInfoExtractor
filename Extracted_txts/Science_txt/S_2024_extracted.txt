are only of minor importance

‘A.wade range of simple Co(-+11) compounds are known including CoO,
Co(OH),. CoS. and salts of the common acids such as CoCls, CoBts
‘C0805. Co(NOy)s, and COCO, The hydrated salts are all pik or red and
contain the hexahydrate 10n [Co(H,O).?* Most Co(+ll) compounds
‘except the carbonate are soluble in water

formed Commercially this blue glass is ground up and the powder which
scaled salt 1s used as a pigment to give a blue colour to glass, enamels
and glazes. Smalt was known to the ancient Egyptians and the Romans In
the laboratory ‘cobalt glass 1s used to observe the flame test for potas
tm the presence of sodium The blue glass absorbs the intense yelow
coloration from sodium, thus allowing the colour from potassium 10 Be
