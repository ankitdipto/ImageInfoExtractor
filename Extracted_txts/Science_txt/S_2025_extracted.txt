Co(+II) has a d’ configuration. [Co(H,0).]** and most Co(+II) com-
plexes are low-spin octahedral. Tetrahedral complexes are also common
and have more intense colours than octahedral complexes. This is because
a tetrahedron lacks a centre of symmetry and thus easily overcomes the
Laporte selection rule (that A/ = 1), whereas the octahedral complexes
have to rely on asymmetric vibrations of ligands to destroy the centre
of symmetry. The magnetic moments of both octahedral and tetrahedral
complexes are higher than predicted using the spin only formula which
would give 1 = 3.87 BM. In the octahedral case this is because there is an
orbital contribution since with a (to,)° (eg)° arrangement it is possible to
transform one f, orbital into another. In tetrahedral complexes the
electronic arrangement is (e,)* (tag)? so transformation of the tz. orbitals is
not possible and the orbital contribution is zero. However, in this case
spin orbit coupling occurs. This accounts for the higher than expected
value of p (see ‘Measurement of magnetic moments’, Chapter 18).

Cobalt(Il) acetate Co(CH;COO), - 4H20 is formed by dissolving CoCO3
in acetic acid. It forms red crystals which are very soluble, and is used as a
drying agent for varnish and lacquers.

Anhydrous Co salts cannot be made by heating the hydrated salts,
because they decompose to the oxide. Thus dry preparative methods are
used. Anhydrous CoF, is pink and is obtained from the reaction of HF with
CoCl,. Anhydrous CoCl, (blue) and CoBr, (green) are made by heating
the elements. Anhydrous Col, is blue-black and is made by heating the
metal with HI. They all have solid structures in which Co?* is octahedrally
coordinated.

Co(+H) forms a number of complexes, but these are less stable than
those of Co(+III). Co(+II) complexes may be tetrahedral or octahedral.
Since there is only a small difference in stability between them the two
forms sometimes exist in equilibrium. The large monodentate ligands Cl”,
Br~. 17, OH™ and SCN7 commonly form tetrahedral complexes. Co(+II)
forms more tetrahedral complexes than any other transition metal ion.
This is associated with the fairly small loss of crystal field stabilization
energy of 0.27A, with a d’ ion in a weak ligand field (see Table 7.15).

The blue coloured complex Hg|Co(NCS),J is unusual. The Co* is tetra-
hedrally coordinated by N atoms, and Hg?~ is tetrahedrally coordinated
by S atoms, giving a polymeric solid. This compound is often used to
calibrate a magnetic balance when measuring magnetic moments.
fone complexes are high spin, but the CN™ ligand produces
a plexes. If a solution of a Co* salt is treated with excess CN
th ber <cloured complex [Co(CN).<]*~ is formed. This can be isolated as
complen is salt Ttisa good catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkenes. The
square pyran Tenet with one unpaired electron, and its shape is a
diamagnetic and he imerize to give purple [Cox(CN) 1} -, which is
carbonyl Mny(CO) at he structure (CN),Co—Co(CN), similar to the

MNAACO)w Mis interesting that [Co!"(CN)<]*~ is formed instead
