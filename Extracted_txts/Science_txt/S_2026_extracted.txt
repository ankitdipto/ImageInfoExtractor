back bonding Back bonding inereases the crystal field splitting A which
makes the e, orbitals very high wn energy and thus strongly antibonding. I
fn octahedral complex was formed these high energy ¢, orbitals must
contain one electron This makes the octahedral complex too unstable to
exist (In marked contrast Co(+It) has the configuration (ta, (e,) and
the octahedral complex [Co""(CN),|"_ 1s extremely stable)

Less commonly Co(+11) forms square planar complexes with bidentate

porphynns Magnetic measurements can be used to distinguish between
tetrahedral and square planar arrangements Tetrahedral complexes have
three unparred electrons and square planar only one

Co? rons are very table and are difficult to oxndize_Co'* rons are less
stable and ate reduced by water In contrast many Co(+II) complexes are
