Figure 25.6 Vitamin B,2. The corrin ring is shown in heavy type.

 

The complex (Figure 25.7) is a Schiff’s base and is capable of reversible
oxygenation and deoxygenation in pyridine solution at room temperature.
Though Co complexes are not involved in oxygen metabolism in the body,
they serve as useful models for metal-oxygen binding in biological

systems.

Figure 25.7 A complex of Co(+II) with both N and O donors.

Ferrocene-like complexes- are formed by Co and Rh. Cobaltocene
(Col(8-CsHy),] is formed by reacting sodium cyclopentadienide NaC;Hs
with anhydrous CoCl, in tetrahydrofuran. It is dark purple, and is air sensi-
tive. It is easily oxidized (i.e. loses an electron) to form the very stable yellow
coloured ion {Co"l(n5-C.H,).]+. The latter is not oxidized even by con-
Centrated HNOs , but like ferrocene the rings are attacked by nucleophilic
