reagents Rhodocene (Rh"(n!-CsHa)z] 15 rather less stable, and tends to
dimenze

Rhodium and utdium form few (+1) compounds The extstence of Rho
1s uncertain, and IrCl; exists as a polymer There appear to be no
complexes comparable with those of Co(+I1) However, RhCh 3H,015
‘warmed vith a sofutton of sodium acetate in methanol, a dimenc diacetate
1s formed HOH,C Rh (R COO), Rh CHOH The four carboxylate
groups bridge the two Rh atoms, giving a structure ke that for
chromium(Il) acetate (Figure 222). This has a M—M bond length of
2.39 A which i interpreted as a quadruple M—M bond Some complenes
‘wath phosphine ligands are known

{$0 STATE,

‘This1s the most common oxidation state forall three metals, paricuarlyin
complexes Co(+lll) occurs in only a few simple compounds such as
€o;(0,), 18H30,NH,Co(S0,), 12H;Oand KCo(SO,)2_ 12H;0 These
are blue coloured and contain the hexaaqua ron {Co(HO)4)"* They are
all strongly oudizing CoO, 1s not known in the pure state, only 2s 2
hydrated oxide which oxidizes water CoF, 1s a light brown soli, wheh
1s made from CoF: and Fy CoP 1s rapidly hydrolysed by water Its
‘commonly used asa strong fluorinating agent as: is easter to handle ands
less reactive than Fz Anhydrous Co! (NOx), may be prepared from CoFs
ma non aqueous solvent such as NO, or N;Os at low temperatures It has
‘an unusual structure with Co at the centre of an octahedron of O atoms
from three bidentate NO¥ groups The chemstry of Co(-+11) 1s largely
that of its coordination compounds

‘The oxide Coys 1s black and 1s formed by heating the metal sn air at
500°C. It has a spinel structure like FeO. These are better weit
Fel'Fe!",0, and Co!'Col"4O, In this structure the © atoms are approt
rately close packed ‘The larger low spin Ca(+Il) tons occupy halt ofthe
‘octahedral holes and the smaller high-spin Co(+I1) are m one exghth ofthe
tetrahedral holes

Co(+I11) complexes are produced easily, an contrast to the difcuty
preparing compounds with simple Co™ rons Co(-+III) forms more
complexes than any other element

Some common complexes are listed below with their colours It can be
seen that the cobalt can form cation, anion and neutral complexes
