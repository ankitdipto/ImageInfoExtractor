Practically all complexes of Co(+III) have six ligands in an octahedral
arrangement. The metal has a d® configuration, and most of the ligands are
strong enough to cause spin pairing, giving the electronic arrangement
(tog)® (e,)°. This arrangement has a very large crystal field stabilization
energy. Such complexes are diamagnetic. The one exception Is [CoF¢}
which isa high-spin complex, and is paramagnetic, Complexes with nitrogen
donor ligands (ammonia and amines) are the most common.

These complexes may be prepared by oxidation of a solution containing
Co?* with air or HzO, in the presence of appropriate ligands and a catalyst
such as activated charcoal. It is also possible to substitute ligands in an
existing complex. The complexes are very stable, and ligand exchange
(substitution) reactions occur only slowly. This is the reason why
complexes of Co(+II!) have been so extensively studied since the 1890s
by Werner and others. Much of our knowledge on the stereochemistry,
isomerism and general properties of octahedral complexes has come from
these studies.

Co** has an affinity for N donors such as NH, ethylenediamine,
amines, EDTA and the nitrite ion NOZ. The salt sodium cobaltinitrite
Na3{Co(NOz)e] is an orange coloured solid. It is used in both qualitative
and quantitative analysis to precipitate K* as K3[{Co(NO>)¢]. The complex
[Co(CN),]*~ is extremely stable and is not decomposed even by alkalis.
The CN ligands are very firmly bonded by x back bonding, and the cry-
stal field stabilization energy is very high. The complex is claimed to be
non-toxic.

An aqueous solution containing {Co!!(CN)s]*~ and KCN can be oxidized
by air to give a brown coloured complex Kg[(CN)sCo!!—O—O—Cé""
(CN)«]. The peroxo bond length O—O is 1.45 A compared with 1.48 Ain
H202. This complex can be oxidized by air, or better by Bra, to give a red
complex Ks{(CN)sCo—O—O—Co(CN)<]. Whilst this might contain Co!"
and Co!Y, the X-ray structure shows that the Q—O bond length is very
much shorter than before at 1.26A. The reason for this shortening is that
an antibonding electron has been removed from the O—O?™ ion and this
has now become a superoxide linkage with a bond order of 1.5 (see
Chapter 4). If solutions of the peroxo or superoxo complexes are boiled,
yellow coloured K3{Co(CN),] is formed.

_ Several different isomers are found in complexes with the bidentate
ligands such as ethylenediamine (en), acetylacetone or oxalate ions:

4Co** + 12en + 4H* + 0, 4[Co!(en);]** + 2H,O

recmcomplex potassium tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) contains the
[co (en)3}** ion which is optically active and exists in d and / forms (see
rape 7 under ‘Isomerism’). A similar preparation in the presence
; Cl gives the dark green salt trans-[Co!(en)9(Cl)2]°* which on care-
icone sPoration ofa neutral solution gives the purple cis isomer. Both
[Co(en) ont substitution reactions on heating with water, giving first
actio a )(H20)] then [Co(en)2(H02)]°*. Similar substitution re-
nS occur with other ligands such as NCS~, giving [Co(en)2(NCS),]*.
