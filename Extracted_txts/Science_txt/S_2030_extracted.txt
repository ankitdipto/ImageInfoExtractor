‘GROUPS THE COBALT GROUP

Complexes with O donors are generally tess stable but those with
chelating ligands such as {Co(acetylacetone),] and [Co(oxalate),]" are
stable and are optically active

Halogen complexes are rare and [CoF,|* 16 the only hexahalde
complex known ‘This 1s blue as v8 [COF\(H O)s} and both ate unusual
because they are high spin and hence are paramagnene with @ magnetic
‘moment of about $ 8 Bohr magnetons

‘Vitamin By» 18 an smportant Co complex. The vitamin Was isolated from
liver after it was found that eating large quantities of raw hver was an
effective teeatment for pernicious anaemua Tnyections of vitamin By are
row used for treatment (more pleasant than eating ravlver!) Vitamin
ts a coenzyme and serves as a prosthetic group which 1s tightly bound to
several enzymes in the body but the precise role of vitamin Bz 1s not fully
understood. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodghia was awarded the Nobel Prize for
‘Chemistry an 1964 for X ray crystallographic work mcluding solving the
structure of this enzyme The complex contains a Co(+Hll) 1on at the
centre of a corrin ring system (Figure 25 6) This is simular to the arrange
‘ment of Fe(+tl) in a porphyrin ring ip haemoglobin except thatthe comin
ring sless conjugated and rings A and D are jouned directly The Co atom
1s bonded to four ring N atoms ‘The fifth postticn 1s occupied by another N

to the comma ring. ‘The stxth group which makes up the octahedron s the
