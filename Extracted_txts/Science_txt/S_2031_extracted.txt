cobalt pellet. The pellet is recovered and reused when the animals are
slaughtered.) Larger amounts of cobalt appear to be harmful. Traces of
cobalt (1-1.5 ppm) are added to beer to make it froth better. This has been
linked with an increased rate of heart failure among heavy beer drinkers
who have a dietary deficiency of protein or thiamine.

All the (+111) halides RhX3 and IrX3 are known. RhF; is prepared by
fluorinating RhCly, IrF by reducing IrF, with Ir, and the others by direct
reaction. They are all insoluble in water, unreactive and probably have
layer lattices. The oxide Rh,O; is obtained by burning the metal in air.
Ir,0; is only obtained with difficulty as the hydrated oxide, by-adding
alkali to Ir! solutions under an inert atmosphere, as it oxidizes easily
to Ir'¥O>. In contrast to the oxidizing properties of [Co™(HO).}**,
[Rh""'(H,0)¢]°* exists as a stable yellow coloured ion.

A considerable number of Rh(+III) and Ir(+III) complexes are known.
Like the complexes of Co(+III) they are typically octahedral, stable, low
spin and diamagnetic, e.g. [RhCl6]°~, [Rh(H20)¢]°**, and [Rh(NH3).}**.
The chloride complexes are made by heating finely divided Rh or Ir with a
Group 1 metal chloride and chlorine.

2Rh + 6NaCl + 3Cl, > 2Nas[RhCl.]

The complex Na3[RhClg] - 12H2O is red coloured and is the best known
compound of rhodium. On boiling with water it gives [Rh(H,0),]°*, and
with NaOH it gives RhyO3;-H2O. The yellow coloured hydrated ion is
converted back to the chloro complex with HCI. If Rh.O3-H20 is treated
with a limited amount of HCI then [RhCl3-3H2O] is formed, but with
excess acid [RhClk]°~ is formed instead. [RhCh - 3H,0] is octahedral, and
should exist as two different isomeric forms fac and mer (see Figure 7.3).

A small number of complexes are known which are not octahedral, e.g.

[RhBrs}*" and [RhBr7]*~. Metal—metal bonds are found in a few
complexes:

[(RsAs)sRh"(HgCl)]*CI~__ contains Rh-Hg bond
[Ir2Clg(SnCl3)4]*~ contains Ir—Sn bonds

Rh(+III) and Ir(+III) form basic acetates [Rh30(CH3COO).L3]*
which have unusual structures. The Rh atoms form a triangle with an O
atom at the centre. The six acetate groups act as bridges between the Rh
atoms ~ two acetate groups across each edge of the triangle. Thus each Rh
atom is linked to four acetate groups and the central O, and the sixth
Position of the octahedron is occupied by water or another ligand. The
magnetic moment is reduced due to partial pairing of d electrons on the
three metal atoms by means of dn—px bonding through O. This type of

carboxylate complex is also formed by the trivalent ions of Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru,
Rh and Ir.

Several hydride complexes are also known: [Rh(R3P)3-H-Cl,]** and

rire *Cla**, [Ir(RaP);-H2Ci}** and [Ir(R3P)3H3]°*. Reduction
i) and Ir(+III) complexes gives the metal, whereas reduction of
0(+II1) gives Co(+11).
