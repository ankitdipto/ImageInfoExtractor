(419) STATE

‘Ts 1 the hughest oxtdation state normally obtained for cobalt Oxwdation
of alkaline Co®* solutions gues an ill defined product thought to be
hydrated CoO>, and a complex Ba,Co!YO, has been reported

If the activated charcoal catalyst 1s omitted from the preparation of
[Co(NHs)«)°* by the aur oxidation of Co™*. then a brown compound
containing {(NHs),Co!"—O—O—Col"(NHs)q|** can be solated Ths
ts stable im concentrated NH,OH solution, or as the solid but can be
‘oxidized by strong oxidizing agents such as persulphate ($203) to pie a
_feen peroxo complex which formally contains Co(+1V)

“The magnetic moment of the green complex is about 1 7 Bohr magnetons
‘This 1s 1m agreement with the presence of Co{+Itt) {d* low spin dit
magnetic) and Co(+1¥) (a tow spin, one unpaited electron) However
electron spin resonance indicates that both Co atoms are identical Thus an
«electron must be able to move across the peroxo bridge and spend an equal
amount of time on both metal atoms
Several other binuclear complexes are known which use —O—O—

OH", NH or NH? as bridging groups
