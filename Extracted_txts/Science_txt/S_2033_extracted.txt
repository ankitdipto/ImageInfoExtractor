ND (+VI) STATES

") compounds do not exist under normal conditions. Rh(+¥V) and
exist as pentafluorides (RhFs), and (IrFs)4. These are very reactive
readily hydrolysed. They have a tetramericstructure with M—F—M
similar to Nb, Ta, Mo, Ru and Os (Figure 21.1). The only com-

nown are Cs[RhF,] and Cs[IrF,].

VI) and Ir(+VI) occur only in RhF, and IrF¢, which are made by
eaction. Neither is stable, though the heavier IrF, is more stable
Fo.
