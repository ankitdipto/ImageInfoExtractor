INTRODUCTION

Nickel 1s moderately abundant and 1s produced in large quantities. Its
used in large quantities im 2 wide vanety of alloys, both ferrous and non
ferrous Its predorunantly divalent and onic «a strmple compounds, and
‘exists as Ni(+II) in the most of ts complexes. These are commonly square
planar or octahedral Palladwm and platmum are both rare and expensive
‘They are noble and not very reactive but are slightly more reactive than
the other platinum group metals They are both used as catalysts The
most common oxidation states are Pd(+Il) and Pt(+II) and P1(+1V)
‘These are not one

[Nickel 15 the twenty second most abundant element by weight sn the
‘earth's crust Commercially important Ni ores include sulphides, which
are usually mixed with Fe or Cu sulphides, and alluvial deposts of sh
cates and oxtdes/hydroxides. Pentlandite (Fe,Ni)oSe 1s the most mpor
