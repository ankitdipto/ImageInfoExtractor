Very strong permanent magnets are made from Alnico steel Mone!
metal 1s very tesistant to corrosion and 1s used tn apparatus ta handle Fy
and other corrosive fluorides It contains 68% Ni 32% Cu and traces of Fe
and Mn_Several non ferrous alloys ate important. The Nimonic sett f
alloys (75% Ns with Cr Co Al and Ti) ate used in gas turbine afd jet
‘engines where they are subjected to high stresses and high temperatores
‘Others such as Hastelloy C are sed for their corrosion resistance Nich
some contains 60% Ni and 40% Cr and 1s used to make the wire Which
gets red hot in electric radiators Cupro nickel (80% Cu and 20% Ni) 5
used to make silver coins The so called mickel~stiver contains ro¥ehly
60% Cu 20% Niand 20% Zn This s used to make ymstation silver attics
and can be electroplated on other metals to give EPNS (electroplated
mchel-silver) The name nickel-silver ss confusing ast contains no silver
‘Often steels electroplated with Ni before electroplating with Cr Some Ni
is used in Ni/Fe storage battenes which have the advantage thatthe) €2

amounts of very finely divided Nt (Raney Na) are used for many redton
processes Examples include the manufacture of hexamethylenediaTtme

Pa and Peare rare elements but they are appreciably more abundant that
the other platinum group metals (Ru. Os Rh and Ir) World producto ol
all sx platinum group metals was only 281 tonnes in 1992 Neary 100
tonnes of this was Pt. Even though Pd 1s slightly more abundant tan
Pt, production of Pt 1s greater than that of Pd The largest sues
were South Africa 54%, the Soviet Union 37% and Canada 4% South

‘The platinum group metals occur as traces in the sulphide ores of Ci
and Ni They are obtamed as concentrates as anode sludge from lee
ttolytic processes for the major metals. ‘The platinum group metal tt
also obtained from the Cu/Nt alloy produced in the separation ¢f the
sulphide matte of CusS and NiSx1n the process outhned for Ni abO¥e
Separation of the platinum metals 1s complex but an the last 388
(NH,)2{PtCl] and [Pa(NH,):CI | are ignited to give the respecte
metals The metals are obtained as powders or sponges and are
cated into solid objects by sintering

Roughly one third ofthe Pt produced 1s used in yewellery one thd
cars and one third for ravestment and for industeral uses. Pt has beer ts
an jewellery since several centuries BC. The earliest users were the 2
Egyptians and the Indians of Peru and Ecuador Nowadays us often 1
to make the mountings for diamonds in rings and other Jewell
