apparatus for manufacturing NaOH. Pd and Pt are both rapidly attacked
by fused alkali metal oxides and peroxides, e.g Na,O and Na,O2.

Ni reacts with the halogens on heating. It reacts only slowly with
fluorine, so Ni and alloys such as Monel are often used to handle F, and
corrosive fluorides. Ni also reacts with S, P, Si and B on heating. Red hot
Pd reacts with F2, Cl, and Op. Pt is less reactive but at red heat it reacts
with F,, and at a high temperature and pressure it reacts with O2.

All three metals absorb gaseous H». The,amount absorbed depends on
the physical state of the metal. However, Pd absorbs very large volumes
of H, more than any other metal. If red hot Pd is cooled in Hz it can
absorb 935 times its own volume of H>. The hydrogen is mobile and
diffuses through the metal lattice. The conductivity of the metal falls as Hz
is absorbed. The Hy is evolved on heating. Other gases, including He, are
not absorbed, so this process is used to purify Hp.

Pt(+II) and Pt(+IV) form an extremely large number of complexes.
(The two most prolific complex forming elements are Co and Pt.)

LOW VALENCY STATES (—I), (0), (+1)

Ni(—1) is found in the carbonyl anion [Ni2(CO)¢]?7.

The zero-valent state is formed by all three metals. [Ni°(CO),] is
formed by warming Ni and CO. Its formation and subsequent pyrolysis
was important in the Mond process for the purification of the metal.
Though ‘the original process became obsolete in about 1970, a modified
Process is used in Canada. [Ni(CO).] is perhaps the best known carbonyl,
but its stability is much lower than that of carbonyls in earlier transition
metal groups. The [Ni(CO),4] molecule is tetrahedral, volatile, yery
ened easily oxidized and flammable. A phosphine derivative
