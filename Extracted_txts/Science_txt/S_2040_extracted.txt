1s stable, (Pd!(CO),Ch] 1s not very stable, and Ni does not fori any
carbonyl halides. [Ni(CO)4] 1s reduced by sodium in liquid ammo to
give a carbonyl hydride [{N(CO)sH)2] (NH), This 1s red coloured

[Pt(CO)ef¢~ are formed by reducing (PtCI,P~ im alkaline solution under
an atmosphere of CO. No similar Pd compounds have so far been observed

  

(+) STATE,

‘The (+1) state 1s very important forall theee elements A wade vanstyof
simple N* compounds exist These include all the halides, the oxide. Su
pphide, selenide and telluride, salts of all the common acids and also some
less stable ones such as NiCOy and salts of oxidizing 1ons like Ni{C10x)2

‘The hydrated 10n [Ni(H;0).]"* gives rise to the green colour charste
istic of many hydrated Ni salts) Many anhydrous Nn salts are yellow

Double salts are formed with alka metals and NHZ, for example
NISO,(NH,):SOz 6H;O These are isomorphous with the corresp0%
ing double salts of Fe”, Co? and Mg?

‘Though the chemistry of Nis simplified by the dominance of the (+10)
state, the Ni(+ll) compiexes are quite compheated Octahedral and
sasate planar compleses are commonly formes, anda few sessabea,
‘gonal bipyramidal and square-based pyramidal structures are 98°
formed Pd(+H1) and Pt(+11) complexes are all square planar
