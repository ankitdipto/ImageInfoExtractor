The complexes formed with ammonia [Ni(NH3)6]°*. [Ni(H20),
(NH3).)°*, and the complex ethylenediamine [Ni(ethylenediamine);]**
are all octahedral. These octahedral complexes are usually blue in colour,
and they are paramagnetic as the d® ion has two unpaired electrons (Figure
26.1a). In complexes with strong field ligands such as CN™, the electrons
are forced to pair up and diamagnetic square planar complexes such as
[Ni(CN),]°~ are formed (Figure 26.1b). ;

The red coloured complex precipitated by Ni?* and dimethylglyoxime
from slightly ammoniacal solution is also square planar. However, in the
solid the square planar molecules are stacked on top of each other and a
Ni-Ni interaction occurs. The Ni-Ni distance is 3.25 A. This was one of
the earliest examples of metal to metal bonding, and in the solid Ni should
be regarded as octahedrally coordinated rather than square planar. The
formation of this complex is used both for the detection and quantitative
estimation of Ni. The dimethylglyoxime loses a proton, and forms a stable
complex molecule. The complex is stabilized because two five-membered
chelate rings are formed, and also by internal hydrogen bonding, shown by
dotted lines in Figure 26.2.

The square planar complexes are generally red, brown or yellow in
colour. The reason for the formation of square planar complexes is dis-
cussed further in Chapter 7.

Several tetrahedral Ni(+II) complexes are known. These generally
contain halide ligands, and often phosphine, phosphine oxide or
arsine ligands as well, as in [PhyAs]}[NiCl,]?~, [(Ph3P)2-NiCl)] and
[Ph3AsO).NiBr)]. These complexes are typically intensely blue coloured,
and can be easily distinguished from square planar complexes both by
the colour, and because they are paramagnetic (Figure 26.3).

When nickel cyanide is crystailized from a mixture containing ammonia
and benzene, benzene ammino nickel cyanide is formed. The benzene
molecules are not bonded, but are trapped in the cagework of the crystal.
Such compounds are called clathrates and other molecules of a similar size
may be trapped in a similar way.
ang) and Pr exist as oxides, halides, nitrates and sulphates. The
but MON sol ‘ : are generally not ionic. PdO exists in the anhydrous state,
MX. a Knee known as an unstable hydrated oxide. All the dihalides
