with six such, units linked by halogen bridges (Figure 26.4b). This is
remarkably similar in shape to the [NbgCl,2]** cluster compound shown
in Figure 21.3d. In this the six Nb atoms were linked in an octahedral
cluster with halogen atoms bridging all 12 edges. B-PdCl, is soluble in
benzene and retains its structure. Despite the similarity in shape, the
f-PdCl, structure appears to be covalent and stabilized largely by halogen
bridges rather than by metal-metal bonding as in [NbgCly2}**.

An important reaction occurs between PdCl2 and alkenes. With ethene,
complexes such as [Pd(C2H,)Cls]~. {Pd(C2Hy)Cls]2 and {[Pd(C2H,)2Clo}
are formed.

Similar compounds are known for Pt: for example, Zeise’s salt
K(Pt(C)H4)(Cl)3]-H20 forms yellow crystals and has been known
since 1825. The structure of these alkene complexes is unusual. In
Zeise’s salt the [Pt(C2H,)(Cl)3]~ ion is essentially square planar with
Cl at three corners and HyC==CH; at the other corner. However, the
H,C=CH, molecule is perpendicular to the PtCl; plane, and the two
C atoms are almost equidistant from the Pt. (The Pt—C distances are
2.128A and 2.135A.) The C=C distance in the complex is 1.375A
compared with 1.337 A in ethene and a C—C distance of 1.54 A in ethane.
Thus the double bond is only lengthened slightly in forming the complex.
The double bond occupies the coordination position rather than a single
C atom, and C,H, acts as a dihapto ligand. Thus the complex should be
written K[Pt(q?-CoH4)(Cl)3] -H20.

The bonding in these alkene complexes was not understood until 1951
when Dewar suggested that the t bond donated electrons to a vacant o
orbital on the metal, rather than involving bonding an individual C atom.

This idea was extended by Chatt in 1953, and current thinking is that
bonding is in two parts:

1. A dative bond in which the electron pair in the filled x orbital on ethene

5 overlaps with an empty hybrid orbital on the metal, giving a o bond.

27 overlap also occurs between a filled metal d orbital and an empty
antibonding orbital on ethene. This is t back donation or back bonding.
Most of the transition elements form complexes with alkenes. The
exceptions are the first few elements where the d orbitals on the metal
are not sufficiently populated to allow back bonding. The extent of back

bonding varies from one complex to another, and is related to the C=C
bond length.
