Besides theoretical interest m the bonding in these complexes, some até
fof importance in commercial processes Complexes between PdCl, and
alkenes are decomposed by water, giving ethanal (acetaldehyde)

CuH, + PACI, + 20 CH\CHO + Pd + 2HCI

‘Ths reaction forms the basis of the Wacker process forthe production of
acetaldehyde The Pd is converted back snto PAC}, 1n situ by CuCl,

Pd + 2CuC + PCH + 2CuCI
‘The solution contains Hl and the CuChz 1 regenerated by passing m Os
2CuCl + ZHCI + 40; 2CuCL; + HO
‘Thus the overall reaction 1s
H,C=CH; + 40; ~+ CH\CHO

“Ths process s practicable because the reaction between Pd and CuCl
quantitative, so the catalysts recycled and only small amounts of Pa até
required for replenishment

Wnh propene CH; CH=CH;, the product 1s acetone ‘This reactio®
1s also of commercial importance’ If the reaction 1 carted out in acct
aend, ethene s converted to vinyl acetate Though this not a commerci!
process because of corrosion problems and difiulty in catalyst recoverys
Whas led to a study of paladiun(H) acetate (PE(CH.COO)2}, Ths het
an unusual structure, comprising thee metal atoms sn a tangle, held
together by sx bndging acetate groups
