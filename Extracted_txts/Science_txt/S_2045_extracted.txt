Figure 26.6 Stacks of square planar [Pt(ethyleneciamine)Cl,] molecules.

K,[Pt(CN)4]Cly 3: 3H2O. The filled d? orbitals on the Pt ators overlap,
giving a delocalized band along the Pt chain. In K[Pt(CN)4]-3H2O this
band is full: hence it cannot conduct. In K2[Pt(CN)4]Bro,3-3H2O the Br
act as electron acceptors, removing on average 0.3 electrons from each
[Pt(CN),]*~ unit. Thus the d? band is only five sixths filled, and hence
the solid conducts electricity by a metallic mechanism in one dimension
(Figure 26.7). In K2{Pt(CN),4]-3H2O the Pt—Pt distance is 3.48 A, but
the strong overlap of the d? orbitals in K,{Pt(CN)4]Bro.3-3H2O reduces
the Pt—Pt distance to 2.8-3.0A.

A very important medical use of Pt(+II) compounds is the use of the cis
isomer of [Pt(NH3)2(Cl)2] as an anti-cancer drug for treating several types
of malignant tumours. The trans isomer is ineffective. The cis isomer is
called cisplatin, and is highly toxic. It is injected into the bloodstream, and
the more reactive Cl groups are lost so the Pt atom bonds to a N atom in
guanosine (part of the DNA molecule). The cisplatin molecule can bond to
two different guanosine units, and by bridging between them it upsets the
normal teproduction of DNA. Those cells which are undergoing cell divi-
sion are attacked by cisplatin. Tumours are usually growing rapidly, but so
also are the bone marrow cells (producing red and white blood cells), and
Cells in the testes (producing sperms), so these are also affected. Dramatic
results are possible, and a large number of patients are completely cured.
There is a critical balance between giving enough cisplatin to kill the tumour

and leaving sufficient white blood cells to protect the body from attack by
bacteria and viruses.
