nickelate(III) Na[Ni!"O,] is formed. The (+III) state can be stabilized in
complexes. K3[NiFe] can be prepared by fluorinating NiCl, and KCL ata
high temperature and pressure. It is a violet solid but is strongly oxidizing
and reacts with H,O, evolving O2. The structure is octahedral, but is
slightly elongated as expected from Jahn-Teller distortion due to its
asymmetrically filled (tog)® (eg)! electronic arrangement. (Ni (ethylene-
diamine);Cl,CI is also octahedral. The structure of [Ni"(PEt,)2Brs] is a
trigonal bipyramid. ; ;

Pd(+III) compounds are very rare and it is doubtful if Pt(+III) exists.
Hydrated oxides may be known. The complexes Na*[PdF,]~ and
NaK,[PdF,] have been reported. The [PdF,]°~ ion has four short bonds
and two long bonds as expected for a low-spin d’ octahedral complex.
Heating Pd and F, gives a stable solid which was once thought to be
PdF3. This has since been shown to be a mixed valency compound
Pd?*[Pd'YF,]?- containing Pd(+II) and Pd(+IV). Complexes which
are apparently in the (+III) state such as [Pt(ethylenediamine)Br3] and
{Pt(NH;)2Br3] consist of chains of alternate square planar Pt(+II) units
and octahedral Pt(+IV) units (Figure 26.8).

(+IV) STATE

Ni(+IV) is rare. The hydrated oxide is made by powerful oxidation of
Ni?* in fused alkali, and the product oxidizes Mn?* to MnO; and de-
composes water. Fluorination of NiCl, and KCI gives the red complex
K,[Ni'¥F,] which is strongly oxidizing and liberates O, with water.

PdO; is only known in the hydrated form. In contrast PtO, is the most
stable oxide of Pt and exists in both anhydrous and hydrated forms. The
anhydrous oxide is insoluble, but the hydrated form dissolves in acids and
alkalis.

PdF, is the only known halide of Pd, but all four Pt halides PtX, are
known. Direct reaction of Pd and F, gives PdF; (really Pd![Pd'¥F¢]) and
PdF,, whilst Pt gives PtF,, PtFs and PtF¢. PtCl, is formed either by direct
Teaction, or by heating H»[PtCl.].

Prk, HA[PtCle] “> Prcl, + 2HCI
Pd(+IV) forms a few octahedral complexes [PdX¢]2~ where X = F, Cl
or Br, and [PdX,(NH3)2]. These are generally reactive. [PdF,]?~ hydro-
lyses rapidly in water whilst the other halide complexes are decomposed
by hot water, giving [Pd"X,}?> and halogen.
“4 i" contrast Pt(+IV) forms a very large number of very stable octahe-
7 complexes. These range from [Pt(NH3).]**, [Pt(NH3)sCl}>*,
t '(NH3)sCla]?*. . to [PtClo]2-. Similar series of complexes exist with
Nowe Tange of ligands including F~, CI”, Br~, I", OH™, acetyl acetone,
the 2 SCN »SeCN~, and CN~. Some of these were studied by Werner in

Chin ly Studies on coordination complexes (see Chapter 7).

hloroplatinic acid is commercially the most common Pt compound. It
