the metals only at high temperatures, and bring out the higher valencies,
e.g. OsFe. IrFe, Pts. The lower valency states are unstable except in
complexes. Few simple ions exist. Because of the lanthanide contraction,
the radii of the second and third rows of transition elements are very
similar. Thus their atomic volumes are almost the same, so the densities
of Os, Ir and Pt are almost double those of Ru, Rh and Pd. All six ele-
ments are rare.

Both the ferrous metals and the platinum metals are typical transition
elements, and are characterized by:

1. coloured compounds

2. variable valency

3. catalytic properties

4. an ability to form coordination compounds

The differences between the two groups are:

1. increased stability of higher oxidation states
2. disappearance of simple ionic forms
3. increased nobility

These are the normal changes expected in a vertical group.
