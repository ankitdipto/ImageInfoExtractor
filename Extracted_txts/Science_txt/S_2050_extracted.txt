INTRODUCTION

The elements all have one s electron outside 2 completed d shell They
show only slight smilanties in properties and considerable differences
All three metals have the same erystal steucture (cubic close packed)
‘They conduct eleetncity and heat particularly well, and they tend to be
noble (unreactive) ‘The only rons which exist an solution (apart from
complexes) are Cu®* and Ag” The most stable oxidation state vanes,
Cul+I1), Ag(+1) and Au(+II1) Copper 1s produced on a large seale and
11 milion tonnes were used in 1992, mostly as the metal and in alloys
Copper is biologically important in various oxidase enzymes, a8 an oxygen
carrier 19 invertebrates end in photosynthesis There 1s great interest in
‘vanious mixed oxides of copper which act as superconductors

 

ABUNDANCE, EXTRACTION AND USES OF THE ELEMENTS

Copper 1s moderately abundant and is the twenty fifth most abundant
element in the earth’s crust It occurs to the extent of 68 ppm by weight
Silver and gold are quite rare (Table 27 2)
