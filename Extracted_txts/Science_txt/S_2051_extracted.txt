Copper
Copper nuggets (i.e. pieces of metal) have been found in the earth, but
this source is largely exhausted. The most common ore is chalcopyrites
CuFeS;. This has a metallic lustre and is similar in appearance to pyrites
FeS, (fool's gold) but is more copper coloured. Other ores include Cu,S
(called copper glance or chalcocite; dark grey coloured), basic copper
carbonate CuCO;-Cu(OH), (which is called malachite and is green),
copper(I) oxide Cu,O (which 1s called cuprite and is ruby red coloured)
and CusFeS, (called bornite or ‘peacock ore’ because it has a mixture of
iridescent colours like a peacock’s feathers (blue, red, brown and purple)).
Turquoise CuAlg(PO4)4(OH)g -4H2O is a popular gemstone because of
its blue colour and delicate veining.

The sulphide ores are often lean and may contain only 0.4-1% Cu.
These are crushed and concentrated by froth-flotation, giving a concen-
trate with 15% Cu. This is then roasted with air.

2CuFeS; —2 Cu, + Fe,03 + 380,
1400- 1450°C
Sand is added to remove the iron as iron silicate slag Fe2(SiO3)3 which
floats on the surface. Air is blown through the liquid matte of Cu,S with
some FeS and silica, causing partial oxidation:

2FeS + 30, 2FeO + 2802
FeO + SiO, > Fe,(SiO3)3
Cu,S + O02 Cu,0 + SOz
After some time the air is turned off and self-reduction of the oxide and
sulphide occurs, giving impure ‘blister copper’ which is 98-99% pure.

sctrodes with an electrolyte of dilute H,SO, and CuSO,.
and Nef onomic to treat very lean ores in this way, so these are dug up
Cit exposed to the air to weather. The CuS oxidizes slowly to CuSO,

Which is leached (dissolved out) with water or dilute H2SO,. Copper is
