GROUP 11 - THE COPPER GROUP COINAGE METALS —]

World production of mined Cu was 93 mullion tonnes in 1992 ‘The;
largest sources of copper ores are an Chile 21%, the USA 19%, the
Soviet Union 9%, Canada 8% and Zambra 5% In addition, about 17
rullion tonnes of scrap metal were reeycled, giving a total of 11 milion
tonnes

‘The metal 1s used in the electrical industry because ofits high conduc.
tuvity Its also used for water pipes because of its mertness Over 100
different alloys of copper exst These include brass (Cu/Zn with 20-50%
Zn), so called “nickel silver’ (55-65% Cu 10-18% Ni 17-27% Zn)
phosphor bronze (Cu wih 1 25-10% Sn and (35% P) and various alloys
formakingcomns Copper sulphate is produced in moderately large amounts
323956 tonnes in 1991. Several copper compounds are used in agneul
ture For example, Bordeaux mixture 1s baste copper hydroxide, and 1s
made from CuSO, and Ca(OH); It ss an important spray for preventing
fangus attack on the leaves of potatoes (potato blight) which caused the
potato famine m freland im 1845-1846 It 1s also used t0 spray wines 10
prevent fungal attack Basic copper carbonate, copper acttate and copper
‘oxochionde have also been used Pans Green isan insecticide made from
‘basic copper acetate arsenious oxide and acetie acid

‘There has been enormous interest n a variety of mixed oxides of cop
per such as Laz ,Ba,CuOys-.) since these behave as superconductors
at temperatures below SUK G" Bednore and A. Muller were awarded
the Nobel Prize for Physics im 1987 for work on these compounds Other
superconductors which work at higher temperatures (up to 128K) ate
based on YBa,Cu07-, These ate describes mn Chapter 5 under Super
conductivity"

 

Silver

Saver 15 found as sulphide ores AgsS (argentte) as the ehlonde AgCI
(horn silver) and as the mative metal There are three extrction processes

1 Most is now obtained as a by product from the extraction of Cu Pb ar
Za_{tcan be obtained from the anode shme formed in the electrolyte
refining of Cu or Zn

2 Zinc 1s used to extract silver by solvent extraction from molten tevd 19
Patke’s process

3 Silver and gold are extracted by making soluble cyanide complexes

World production of silver was 13818 tonnes mm 1992 The main pro
ducers were Mexico 17%, the USA 13%, Peru 11% Canada and Austria
9% each, and the Soviet Union and Chile 7% each The man uses of
silver are as AgCI and AgBr in photographic emulsions for jewellery and
silver ornémeats, for battenes and for silerieg mrrors

Gold

Histoncally gold has been found as lumps of metal mn the ground called
fougeets. Finds of this kind have started gold cushes «a the USA How
