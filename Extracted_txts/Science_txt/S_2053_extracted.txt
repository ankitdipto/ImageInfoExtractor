ever. gold occurs mainly as grains of metal disseminated in quartz veins.
Many of these rocks have weathered with time. The gold and powdered
rock are washed away in streams and accumulate as sediments in river
beds. The grains of gold can be separated from silica by ‘panning’, i.e.
swirling them both with water. Gold is very dense (19.3gcm~*) and,
rapidly settles to the bottom, but the SiO2, with a density of 2.5gcm7>,
settles more slowly and is thrown away with the water. This method is little
used nowadays since the sources are largely exhausted.

Nowadays rocks containing traces of gold are crushed and extracted
either with mercury or with sodium cyanide. Water and powdered rock
are passed over mercury, in which the gold dissolves, forming an amalgam.

The gold is recovered by distilling the amalgam, when the mercury distils |.

off and is reused. This process is also used with river water and silt in
Brazil. Losses of mercury have poisoned considerable stretches of the
River Amazon, giving environmental problems. In the cyanide process
the crushed rock is treated with a 0).1-0.2% solution of NaCN and aerated.

4Au + 8NaCN + 2H,O + 0, 4Na[Au(CN),] + 4NaOH

The sodium argentocyanide complex is soluble, thus separating gold from
the rest of the rock. The gold is precipitated from this solution by adding
Zn powder. World production of gold was 2134 tonnes in 1992, and the
main producers were South Africa 29%, the USA 14%) Australia 11%,
the Soviet Union 10%, Canada 7% and China 6%. The major uses are as
gold bullion (which in used as international currency) and for jewellery.
Gold used in jewellery gold is usually alloyed with a mixture of Cu and
Ag. These alloys retain the golden colour, but are harder. The proportion
of gold in the alloy is expressed in carats. Pure gold is 24 carats. The
alloys commonly used are 9 carat, 18 carat and 22 carat, and these contain
9/24, 18/24 and 22/24 pure gold respectively. Small amounts of gold are
used to make corrosion-free electrical contacts, for example on computer
boards. A thin film 10~"' m thick is sometimes deposited on glass windows
in Prestigious skyscraper buildings (e.g. a bank in Toronto). This thin
metal film reflects unwanted heat from the sun in the summer, thus
keeping the building cool. The film keeps heat in during the winter.

 

 

OXIDATION STATES

The elements Cu, Ag and Au show oxidation states of (+1), (+I) and
(+111). However. the only simple hydrated ions found in solution are Cu2*
and Ag”. The univalent ions Cu* and Au* disproportionate in water, and
as a result they only exist as insoluble compounds or complexes. Cu(+III),
Ag(+Il1) and Ag(+I1) are so strongly oxidizing that they reduce water.
Thus they only occur when stabilized in complexes, or as insoluble com-
pounds. The oxides and halides formed are shown in Table 27.3.
