Atoms of Cu. Ag and Au (Table 27.1) have one s electron in their
outer orbital. This is the same outer electronic arrangement as for the
Group | metals. In spite of this, there are few similarities apart from the
formal stoichiometry of compounds in the (+1) state and the high elec-
trical conductivity of both groups of metals. :

Group 11 elements differ from Group | elements in that the penultimate
shell contains ten d electrons. The poor screening by the d electrons
makes the atoms of the copper group much smaller in size. As a result the
Cu group have higher densities and are harder. Their ionization energies
are higher (Table 27.4). and their compounds are more covalent.

In the Cu group the d electrons are involved in metallic bonding. Thus
the melting points and enthalpies of sublimation are much higher than for
Group | metals. .

The higher enthalpy of sublimation and higher ionization energy are the
reasons why Cu, Ag and Au tend to be unreactive, i.e. show noble
character. Group 1 metals have large negative standard reduction poten-
tials (E° values) and are at the top of the electrochemical series. They are
the most reactive metals in the periodic table. In contrast the coinage
metals have positive E° values and are thus below hydrogen in the elec-
trochemical series. Thus they do not react with water or liberate H2 with
acids. The nobility increases from Cu to Ag to Au, whereas on descending
Group | the reactivity increases. The inertness of Au resembles that of the
platinum metals. Cu is inert towards non-oxidizing acids, but reacts with
concentrated HNO; and H2SO,.

However, Cu is very slowly oxidized on the surface in moist air, giving a
green coating of verdigris. This is basic copper carbonate CuCO,- Cu(OH)2
and is familiar on the roofs of buildings covered with copper sheet, and
also on copper statues such as the Statue of Liberty in New York.

Ag will dissolve in concentrated HNO, and in hot concentrated H2SO.-
Au is inert to all acids except aqua regia (a 3:1 mixture of concentrated
Hel and HNO). The HNO; acts as an oxidizing agent and the chloride
ions complexing agent,

Cu reacts with dioxygen, but Ag and Au are inert.
