Tn a similar way passing HS mnto solutions contaimng Cv?" or Ag*
black precipitates of CuS and AgsS All three metals react wath the halo
gens Simple compounds of Au decompose to the metal quite readly,
those of Ag can be reduced fairly easily, and those of Cu less readily

For metals to react, an atom must first be solated from the crystal
structure and then be ionized A high enthalpy of sublimation and a high
tonization energy will reduce reactivity. though this may be partly offet
by the energy gained when the ton 1s hydrated Comparing Cu and K, Cu
hhas a much higher melting point (and hence a higher enthalpy of sub
Iumation) Because of the increased nuclear charge of copper, the orbital
electrons are more tightly held (and hence the ronrzation energy ts higher)
‘The enthalpy of hydration snot large enough to offset these large amounts
‘of energy, and so potassium 1s much more reactive than copper

‘The oxides and hydroxides of Group 1 are strongly baste, and are soluble
im water In contrast the oxides of copper are insoluble and weakly basic
‘Group 1 compounds all contain simple colourless unrvalent ons and only
form complexes with very strong complexing agents In contrast the
copper group elements show variable valency ‘The most common oxida
tion states are Cu(+I1) Ag(+1) and Au(+II1), and the three elements
differ widely 1n their chemistries Their compounds are mainly coloured
land they show a strong tendency to form coordination complexes

Copper ts important in several catalysts Cu 1s used an the direct process
for mamafactare of alkylchlorosianes such as (CH)SiChy. which 1s used
to make sticones Cu and V catalyse the oxidation of eyclohexanalleyclo
hhexanone matures to adipte acid which 1s used to make nylon 66
‘CuCl, was used as the catalyst m the Deacon process for making
HCI

 

 

 

(+1) STATE

In the (+1) state most of the simple compounds and complenes are die
‘magnetic and colourless because the ions have ad" configuration There
are a few coloured compounds For example, CuO 1s yellow or red
Cu,CO41s yellow and Cul is brown In these eases the colour arises from
charge transfer bands and not from d-d spectra

It might be expected that the (+1) state would be the most common and
most stable because of the extra stability resulting from a full d shell
Surprisingly this ss not so Although Ag* 1s stable 19 both the sob! state
and solution Cu” and Au” disproportionate im water
