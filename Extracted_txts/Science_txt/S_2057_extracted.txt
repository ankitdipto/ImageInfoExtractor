The equilibrium constant for the disproportionation of Cu’ in solution is
high, showing that the equilibrium is largely to the right. Thus the con-
centration of Cu* is very low in solution and typically a Cu* ion exists in
aqucous solution for less than a second. Similarly Au* is virtually non-
existent in solution. The only copper(I) and gold(I) compounds that are
stable to water are either insoluble or present as complexes. Examples of
insoluble Cu(+I) compounds include CuCl, CuCN and CuSCN. Copper(I)
thiocyanate CuSCN is used to estimate copper gravimetrically.

Cu?* is reduced to copper(I) oxide CuO by mild reducing agents. This is
the basis of Fehling’s test for reducing sugars (monosaccharides such as
glucose). Equal quantities of two different solutions, Fehling’s A and
Fehling’s B. are mixed immediately before adding the sugar and warming.
The solution is deep blue coloured and if a reducing agent is present a
yellow or red precipitate of CuO is formed. (Fehling’s A solution is a
solution of copper(II) tartrate, made from CuSO, and Rochelle salt
(sodium potassium tartrate). Fehling’s B solution is NaOH.)

Cu,0 is a basic oxide and reacts with the halogen acids HCI, HBr and
HI, giving insoluble CuCl, CuBr and Cul. CuF is unknown. CuCl and
CuBr are usually made by boiling an acidic solution of CuCl, or CuBr,
with excess Cu. This gives a solution containing the complex ions [CuCh]~
and (CuBr)]~ which are lincar in shape. Diluting these solutions gives
white CuCl or yellow CuBr.

Addition of KI toa solution containing Cu?* results in the I~ ions
reducing Cu?* to copper(I) iodide Cul and at the same time I~ is oxidized
to 2. This reaction is used to estimate Cu?* in solution by volumetric
analysis. Excess of KI is added to an acidified solution and the I, produced
is estimated by titrating with sodium thiosulphate.

The copper(I) halides are partly covalent and have zinc blende structures
With tetrahedrally coordinated Cu* ions. In the vapour CuCl and CuBr
are polymeric and the main species is a six-membered ring.

The copper(I) halides are insoluble in water. However, they dissolve in
solutions containing an excess of halide ions by forming soluble halide-
Coinplexes such as [CuClz]~. [CuCl;]?~ and [CuCl]. These and other
Cul complexes are tetrahedral in the solid. (In KCuCl, and K,CuCl, there
are chains in which Cu is tetrahedrally surrounded by Cl, with simple units
Joined into a chain by shared halide ions.) ‘
