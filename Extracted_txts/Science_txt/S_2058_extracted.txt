GROUPII THE COPPER GROUP COINAGE METALS,

 

“The copper(l) halides also dissolve mn strong HCI HNO, and aqueous
solutions of ammonia Solutions of CuCt in concentrated HC! and CuClin
NH,OH are important because they absorb carbon monoxide Three
points arise from this,

1 A solution of CuC1 it NOH 1s often used to measure the amount of

CO in gas samples simply by measuring the change 1n volume of the

2 Though the metals of ths group do not frm neu carbonyl com
pounds an unstable carbonyl halide (Cu(CO)CI is formed by bubbling

CO through a soluten of CuCl Both Cu and Au form carbonyl halides

[M(CO)CI] when CO 1s passed over the heated halide
3 Several complexes with alkenes and alkynes can be made ma similar

‘way by bubbling the hydrocarbon through a solution of Cu! or Ag!
‘Atkene complexes can also be made by passing the hydrocarbon over
the heated halde These have the formula (MRX] where R ss an
unsaturated hydrocarbon and X a halogen These complexes are very
reactive and are often polymere The M—C bonds are not sym
metrical suggesting rather than bonding Au! forms complexes
tess readily and only with high molecular weight alkenes

Cyanide complexes are well known and are used to extract Ag and Au
1s soluble complexes The metals are recovered from the complex by
reduction with zine

4Au+8CN + 2HO+0 + 4[Au'CN)a] + 40H

‘Two coordinate complexes such as [Au(CN)s) have a linear structure
However in solid K[Cu'(CN),] the Cu 1s bonded to three CN gwing a
planar inangular arrangement ‘The CN are bonded m the wsuat way
throueh C but the third CN. acts as2 bridging group to another Cu atom

‘Cyanide rons may rect with metal ions in two ways

1 asa reducing agent
2 as complexing agent

‘Thus ding KCN to 2 CuSOs solution first causes reduction and pre

‘apsates copper(t) cyanide This reacts with excess Cy forming a soluble

four coordinate complex [Cu(CN),]* which ss tetrahedral sn shape

Cu(+1) forms sereral different polymeric complexes which snvohe 3
cluster of four Cu atom a the corners of tetrahedron ut which do not
involve metal-metal bonding The phosphine. and arsine complexes
Cuda(PRy)e and CusL(AsR}s ate examples of such clusters Im these
the four Ct form a tatabedson The four phosphine or arsine hands
are attached to the four corners. and the f atoms are located above the
