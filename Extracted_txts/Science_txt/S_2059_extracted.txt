CC ~ : (GH) STATE

In {Cus(SPh)6]?~ the Cu atoms form a tetrahedron and the six S atoms
bridge the six edges of the tetrahedron. , : .

Ag(+I) is the most important state for silver and many simple ionic
compounds are known containing Ag”. Practically all Ag’ salts are in-
soluble in water. Exceptions include AgNO3, AgF and AgClO, which
are soluble. The salts are typically anhydrous except for AgF -4H2O. The
Ag’ ion is hydrated in solution but only as the dihydrate [Ag(H20)2]*.
Ag! commonly forms two-coordinate complexes rather than four-coordi-
nate complexes as in Cu’.

AgNO; is one of the most important salts. Ag,O is mainly basic, dis
solving in acids. Moist Ag,O absorbs carbon dioxide and forms Ag,COs.
Since Ag,O dissolves in NaOH it must have slight acidic properties too.

The silver halides are used in photography (see later). AgF is soluble
in water but the other silver halides are insoluble. In qualitative analysis
solutions containing the halide ions Cl~, Br~ and I” are tested by adding
AgNO; solution and dilute HNO3. A white precipitate of AgC! indicates
the presence of a chloride, a pale yellow precipitate of AgBr indicates a
bromide and a yellow precipitate of Agl indicates an iodide. The presence
of these halide ions may be confirmed by testing the solubility of the silver
halide precipitates in ammonium hydroxide. AgCl is soluble in dilute
NH,OH, AgBr dissolves in strong 0.880 ammonia, and Agl is insoluble
even in 0.880 ammonia. When AgCl and AgBr dissolve, they form the
ammine complex [H;N-> Ag<—NHg]*, which is linear.

A few silver compounds with colourless anions are coloured. For
example, Agl, AgsCO; and Ag;PO, are yellow and AgpS is black. This
is because the Ag* ion is small and highly polarizing and the anion, e.g.
I”, is large and highly polarizable. This leads to some covalent character.

Ag* forms a variety of complexes. Most simple ligands result in two-
coordination and a linear structure, for example [Ag(NH3)2]*, [Ag(CN)2]~
and [Ag(S203)2|*~. Bidentate ligands form polynuclear complexes. The
halide complexes of Cu* and Ag* are unusual because the stability
sequence is 1 > Br > Cl > F, whilst for most metals the sequence is the
reverse. Ligands capable of x bonding, such as phosphine derivatives, may
form both two- and four-coordinate complexes.

Au(+1) is less stable. It is known as the oxide Au2O. The halides AuC!
and AuBr can be obtained by gently heating the corresponding AuX;
halide. Aul is Precipitated by adding I~ to Aul;. These Au(+1I) com-
pounds disproportionate in water to Au metal and Au(+II).

Au(+I) also exists in linear complexes such as [NC—>Au<CN]-,
[Cl+ AucCl], [R;P—>Au Cl] and [R3P—>Au<—CHg]. The cyanide
complex is soluble in water and is formed in the cyanide extraction pro-
cesses by dissolving Au in an aqueous solution containing CN™ in the
mesence of air or H2O2. Phosphine complexes are made by treating
stitaned Ka me in ether solution, giving R;3PAuCI. The Cl may be sub-
reduced vot er groups such as I, SCN or Me. If R3PAuCl is strongly
formed ae with NaBHy. then a cluster compound Au,)Cl;(RaP);7 is
