Photography
‘The silver hahdes are of great smportance m photography A photographic
film consists of a light sensitive emulsion of fine particles (grains) of silver
salts im gelatine spread on a clear cellulord strip or a glass plate The pram
size is very important to photographers as this affects the quality af she
pictures produced AgBr 1s mainly used as the light sensitive mater!
‘Some Agl is used in ‘fast emulsions (1€ ones wich can take photographs
when the intensity ofthe ight 1s low or are used for photographing mo
‘ng objects like racing cars where the exposure must be very short) AgCl
‘may also be present in the emulsion

‘The film is placed im a camera When the photograph ss exposed. gh
from the subject enters the camera and 1s focussed by the Fens to pve &
sharp image on the film ‘The hight starts a photochenucal reaction bY

film In modern photography only a short exposure of perhaps 1/10h of
