arranged (d, )®(d, -y)! Because the d, orbital contains two electrons the
Iugands approaching along the +2 and —z directions are prevented from
‘coming as elose to the copper as those approaching along +x, =x, +y and
~y (see Chapter 7)

‘This distorted octahedral arrangement 1s common in copper com
pounds For example, the halides CuXz have a distorted rutle (1103)
structure with a coordination number of 6 The bond lengths inthe Cu"X
Tralides are

CuF, 4 bonds 193A and 2 bonds 227A
CuCl, 4 bonds 230A and 2 bonds 295A.
CuBr, 4 bonds 240A and 2 bonds 318A

 

Similar reasoning t0 that for the distortion of octahedtal Cu! com
plexes alsa applies to octahedral complexes of any other metal ion where
the ep orbitals ate aot symmetrically filled, 1 when they conta on ot
three electrons. Distortions of ths kind are found in

Co® and N° Howspin (1° (eg!
and Cet and Mn"* high-spin (tay)* (e,)!

Aqueous Cu’ solutions form many complexes with ammonia
and ammes, such as [Cu(Hz0)<NH)"*.  [Cu(H,0),(NH))2)"
{Cu(H,0)(NHy)xP7* and [Cu(H,0),(NH.]°* Ht as difficult to add
a fifth of sith NEY, though ats posable to'make (Cu(NH)af°* wing
liquid ammonia as colvent. The eeason far this is the Tahn~Tellr effect
which distorts the octahedral complex and makes the fith and sith bonds
long and weak Similarly sath the bidentate ligand ethylenediamine (cn)
the complexes (Cu(en)(Hz0)4]?* and [Cu(en):(H;0)3]?* are formed
suite easily but [Cufen),]®” 1s formed only with a large excess of ethyt
enediamine
