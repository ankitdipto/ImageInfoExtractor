and the complex will be damagnetc IC they do not form a bond then the
‘complex will be paramagnetic However, the magnetic moment measured
at 25°C 1s 1 4BM per Cu atom, rather than the spin only value of ! 73 BM
‘Thus suggests that there isan ‘interaction’ or weak coupling of the unpaed
spins on the two Cu atoms in this complex This 18 thought to involve
lateral overlap of the 3d,.,2 orbitals on the copper atoms, and 1 some-
