 

{ (+I) STATE

Agi! is more stable in complexes such as [Ag(pyridine),]**,
[Ag(dipyridy!)2]?* and [Ag(ortho-phenanthroline)2]** which form
stable salts with non-reducing anions such as NO; and ClO;. They
are usually prepared by oxidizing a solution of Ag* and the ligand
with potassium persulphate. The complexes are square planar and
paramagnetic. ~ | a

A black oxide of formula AgO is formed by strong oxidation of Ag,O
in alkaline solution. Ag'' has a d° configuration and must be paramagne-
tic, but AgO is diamagnetic. AgO does not contain Ag(+II), but is a
mixed oxide AgiAgO2. |

Au(+Il) probably occurs in dithiolene compounds and in
[Au(BoCoH11)2]?~, but otherwise it only exists as a transient
intermediate.

(+111) STATE

The (+III) state is uncommon for Cu and Ag. In alkaline solution Cu?*
can be oxidized to KCu'"'O,, and if a fused mixture of KCI/CuCl, is
fluorinated, K3[Cu'"'F,] is formed. Strong oxidation with periodic acid
(HsIO,) gives KyCu' (10,)2-7H2O. Fluorination of a fused mixture of
alkali metal halide and silver halide gives M*[Ag™F,]~, and electrolytic
oxidation of Ag* can give impure Ag,O3. Oxidation of alkaline Ag,O
with persulphate gives the mixed oxide Ag'Ag™O,. Persulphate in
the presence of periodate or tellurate ions gives compounds such as
KeH[Ag"(10¢)2] and NasH3[Ag!(TeO,)2]. These compounds are all
unstable and are strong oxidizing agents.

In contrast. Au(-+III) is the most common state for gold. There are few
simple compounds, and these do not contain Au** ions. Au!" has a d®
configuration like Pt", and like Pt it forms square planar complexes.
These compounds decompose to the metal quite readily on heating.
{Aull} + OH> > Au(OH); 22", Au,0;2S Au + AuzO + O2

All the halides AuX3 are known. AuCl; is made from the elements, or
by dissolving gold in aqua regia and evaporating.

Au + HNO; + HCl H;,0*[AuCl,]~ -3H,0 —> AuCls

AuBr; is made from the elements and Auly is made from the bromide.
AuF; can only be formed with a strong fluorinating agent:

Au + BrF; > AuF3

The fluoride is made up of square planar AuF, units linked into a chain by
cis fluoride bridges. The chloride and bromide are dimeric.
