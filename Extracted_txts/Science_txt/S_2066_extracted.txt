BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF COPPER

Copper 1s essential to hfe and adult humans contain about 100mg, Ths 5
the third largest amount of a transition metal, after Fe (4) and Zn (2¢)
Though small amounts of Cu are essential, larger amounts ate t0%ie
About 4-Smg of Cu are required daily in'the diet, and deficiency in
animals results un the tnabilty to use tran stored an the liver, Thus the
