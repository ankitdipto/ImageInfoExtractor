INTRODUCTION

These elements all have a d’° s? electronic arrangement and they typically
form M?* ions. However, many of their compounds are appreciably
covalent. Hg(+II) compounds are more covalent and its complexes are
more stable than is the case for Zn and Cd. Because these ions have a
complete d shell, they do not behave as typical transition metals. Though
the ions are divalent, they show only slight similarity with Group 2
elements. Thus Zn shows some similarities to Mg. However, Zn is more
dense and less reactive due to its smaller radius and higher nuclear charge.
Also Zn has a much stronger tendency to form covalent compounds. Zn
and Cd are broadly similar in most of their properties. The behaviour of
He differs appreciably from that of Zn and Cd. In many ways Hg is unique.
It is a liquid at room temperature, it is noble, and it forms ‘apparently
univalent’ mercury(I) compounds. Mercury is the only element in the
group with a well established (+1) oxidation state. The increased stability
of the lowest oxidation state in the heaviest element in the group is more
typical of the p-block elements than the transition elements.

an is produced on a large scale. In 1992, 7.3 million tonnes of the metal
Were produced. It is mostly used as a metal for rustproofing, for casting and
for making alloys. ZnO is also important commercially.

Zinc has an important role in several enzymes. Biologically it is the
Second most important transition metal.
