ABUNDANCE AND OCCURRENCE

Zn occurs 1n the carth’s erust to the extent of 132ppm by weight Its the
‘twenty fourth most abundant clement World production of Zn was 73}
rmilhon tonnes in 1992 The main regions where it 1s mined are Canada
18%, Australia 14%, China 10%, and the Soviet Unton, Peru and the
USA 8% cach Cd’ production 1m 1992 was 20700 tonnes, and Hg
production was 3200 tonnes Cd and Hg are quite rare In spute of ths

‘When the earth was formed Zn was deposited as sulphides. ZnS is mined
and 1s called sphaelente in the USA and zinc blende in Europe. The
structure is hike that of diamond with half the positions occupied by Sand
half by Zn or some other metal Sphaclente almost always contains ren,
and the formula may be written (ZnFe)S This commonly occurs wth
galena PbS Hydrothermal weathenng of the sulphides gave deposts of

EXTRACTION AND USES

Extraction of ne

Zane ores (mainly ZnS) are concentrated by flotation, then roasted nat to
give ZnO and SO, (The SO; 1s used to make 1,80, ) Zn 1s extracted
from the onide by two different processes

1 ZnO may be reduced by carbon mononde at 1200°C ina smelter ‘The
reaction 1s reversible, and the high temperature 1s required to move
