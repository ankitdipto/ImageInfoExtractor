Hig obtained in ths way may contain traces of ather metals dissolved in,
particularly Pb, Zn and Cd. Very pure Hg may be obtained by blowing ai
through the metal at 250°C, when traces of other metals form oxides

‘These oxides float on the surface and are easily removed

1 By scraping them off the surface as scum

2. By treatment with dilute HNOs, when the oxides dissolve

3 Hg can be punted and separated from the other metals and oxides by
ssullation The bosling points are Pb, 1751°C, Zn, 908°C, CA, 765°C,
He, 357°C.

Uses of ine

Zn 15 used v1 farge amounts for coating iron to prevent st from rusting A
thin coating of Zn may be applied electrolytically (galvanzing) Thicker
layers may be apphied by hot dipping (dipping the metal in molten zinc)
‘The latter process is misleadingly calied ‘hot galvanizing’ Alternatively the
‘object may be coated with powdered Zn and heated (Sherardizing) or
sprayed with molten Zn Large amounts of Zn are used to make alloys
‘The most common alloy 1s brass (a Cu/Zn alloy with 20-50% Zn) Zines
the most widely used metal for casting metal parts Zinc 1s also used as he
negative electrode in sealed ‘dry’ battenes (Leclanche cells, mercury cells
and alkaline manganese cells) ZnO 1s sometimes used as a white pigment
tm paint Its particularly bright as xt absorbs UV light and re emuts it as
white light

Uses of cadmium

Most of the Cd produced is used for protecting steel from corrosion It
Applied electrolytically by Cd plating, Ca absorbs neutrons very well, and
18 used to make control rods for nuclear reactors Cd 1s also used for
alkaline Ni/Cd storage battenes used both in diesel locomotives and ao
as the ‘nicad’ rechargeable ‘dry batteries’ used in radios and electral
appliances CdS isan important but expensive yellow pigment: This wed
1m paint

 

Uses of mercury

‘The largest use of mercury 1s m electrolytic cells for the production of
NaOH and Cl, The electrical industry uses Hg in mercury vapour steet
lights, switches and rectifiers Historically Hg has been, and stil, used @
the extraction of precious metals (particularly ver and gold) as amalgans
Phenyl mercury(II) acetate and other oganomercury compounds have
fungicidal and germverdal properties They ate sometimes used in agricul
ture for treating seeds Mercury(l) chloride (Hga\Cls 1 used for treating
lub root, a disease m brassicas (the cabhage farmly of plants) gO has
been used im antifouling paints for ships cte HgCl, rs used to make org2n0
