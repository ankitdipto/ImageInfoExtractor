derivatives. All Hg compounds are toxic, but the organo compounds are
extremely dangerous and have lasting ecological effects. Small scale uses of
mercury include thermometers, barometers and manometers, amalgams,
as a detonator (mercury fulminate) and in some medicines.

 

 

  

OXIDATION STATES

The elements in this group all have two s electrons beyond a completed d
shell. Removal of the s electrons results in divalent compounds, and the
(+11) oxidation state is characteristic of the group.

Hg(+I) compounds are important. The univalent ion Hg* does not
exist, as mercury(I) compounds are dimerized. Mercury(I) chloride is
therefore Hg.Cl, and contains [Hg—Hg]** ions. In these, the two Hg*
species which have a 6s' configuration are bonded together using their s
electrons. Thus mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic. Unstable species
Zn3* abd Cd3* have been detected in fused mixtures such as Cd/CdCh,
and Cd/CdCl,/AICI;..A yellow compound [Cd2][AICI,], has been isolated
from such melts, but it disproportionates instantly in water.

[Ca,}** > Ca?* + Cd

The normal trend is that on descending a group the bonds become weaker
because the orbitals are larger and moe diffuse. Thus overlap is less
effective. The reverse trend is observed in this group. The Hg—Hg bond is
much stronger than the Cd—Cd bond. This is because the first ionization
energy of Hg is much higher than for Cd (Table 28.4), and hence Hg shares
electrons more readily.

Oxidation states higher than (+11) do not occur. This is because removal
of more electrons would destroy the symmetry of a completed d shell.

SIZE

The ionic radii of the M?* ions of Group 12 are appreciably smaller than
for the corresponding elements in Group 2. This is because Zn, Cd and
Hg have 10 d electrons which shield the nuclear charge rather poorly. The
difference in size accounts for the lack of similarity in properties
between the two groups.

Cat = 100A Zn? = 0.74A

SPt= 118A Cd? = 0.95A

Ba* = 1.35A  He?* = 1.02A
The lanthanide contraction results in’ the size of the second and third
Tow transition elements being nearly the same. With earlier pairs of
\ransition elements, Zr/Hf and Nb/Ta, the sizes were particularly close.

With Cd/Hg the effect of the lanthanide contraction is still felt, but to a
much smaller degree, Hg?* is larger than Cd2* but the increase is size is
