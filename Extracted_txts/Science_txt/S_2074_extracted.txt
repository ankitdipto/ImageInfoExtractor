IONIZATION ENERGIES

‘The first sonzation energy for Group 12 elements (Table 28 4) 1s consider
aly higher than for the corresponding Group 2 elements “This s because
the atoms are smaller and the filled level 1s poorly shielding. The filled §f
shell n He further mereases the binding energy of the outer electrons, and
‘the first onraation energy for Hg 1s greater than for any other metal The
second sonveation energies are high, but M?* rons are known for al three

GENERAL PROPERTIES

Zn, Cd and Hig show few of the properties assocrated with typical transivon
elements This 18 because they have a complete d shell, which xs not
available for bonding

1 Zn and Cd do not show vanable valency
2 ‘They have a "electronic configuration and so cannot produce dd
spectra Thus many of their compounds are white However, some
compounds of Hg(+Il) and a smaller number of Ca(+t) are highly
coloured due to charge transfer from the ligands to the metal (The
