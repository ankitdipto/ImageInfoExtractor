[ GENERAL PROPERTIES

metals of this group are smaller and thus have a greater polarizing
power than Group 2 metals. This increases the chance of covalency and
also the chance of charge transfer.)

3, The metals are relatively soft compared with the other transition
metals. This is probably because the d electrons do not participate in
metallic bonding.

4, The melting and boiling points are very low. This explains why the
metals are more reactive than the copper group, even though the
ionization energies for the two groups suggest the reverse. (Nobility is
favoured by a high heat of sublimation, a high ionization energy and a
low heat of hydration.)

Mercury is the only metal which is liquid at room temperature. The
reason for this is that the very high ionization energy makes it difficult for
electrons to participate in metallic bonding. The liquid has an appreciable
vapour pressure at room temperature. Thus exposed mercury surfaces
should always be covered (for example with toluene), to prevent vaporiza-
tion, and hence poisoning. The gas is unusual because it is monatomic like
the noble gases.

Similarities between Group 2 elements with an outer electronic struc-
ture s* and the zine group an outer electronic structure d's? are slight.
Both groups are divalent. The hydrated sulphates are isomorphous, and
double salts such as K2SO,-HgSO,-6H2O are analogous to KSO,-
MgSO,-6H,0. However, the zinc group is more noble, more covalent,
has a much greater ability to form complexes and is less basic.

The reactivity decreases from Zn to Cd to Hg. This is shown by their
standard Teduction potentials. Zn and Cd are electropositive metals. Hg

oni en Cd and Hg may be partly explained by Hg having the highest first

"zation energy of any metal, and by the higher solvation energy of Cd?*
