‘GROUP 12- THE ZINC GROUP. ma)

 

Zn and Cé are silvery solids which tarnish rapidly im moist air Hg is @
salvery liquid and does not tarnish readily Zn and Cd dissolve im cute
non-oxidraing acids, berating Hy. but Hg does not All three metals react
sth oxidizing aeids such as concentrated HNO and concentrated #1;50,
forming salts and evolving 2 mxture of oxides of nitrogen and SO; Under
these conditions He forms (+) salts, but with dilute HNO, a mercury()
salt Hg,(NOs)2 18 slowly formed

Zn1s the only element in the group which shows any amphotene proper
thes, and 111s soluble in alkalts, forming zincates ‘These are formulated
NaxlZn(OH).), Na[Zn(OH), H,0] or NalZn(OH)s (H,O)y simula to
alumunates

‘All three metals form oxides MO sulphides MS and halides MX; by
heating the elements On stronger heatmg HgO decomposes, and ths has
‘been used as a preparation of O

Hg + 0:25. Heo“. Hg + 0;

All three elements form insoluble sulphides In qualitative analysis CaS
(yellow) and HgS (black) are precipitated by passing HS into acidied
solutions ZnS (white) s more soluble and 1s precrpitated by H,S only from
alkaline solutions ZnCh and CdCl; are tonic, but HgCl 1s covalent The
‘energy to promote an s electron to a p level prior ta forming two covalent
bonds deereases from Zn to Cd, but rather surprisingly snereases from Cd
to Hg Zn and Cd react with P to give phosphides. but Fig does not

All three metals form alloys with several other metals Those formed by
‘Cu and Zn are called brass, and different brasses have from 20% t0 50%
Zn These are commercially important Alloys of other metals wth Hare
called amalgams Sodium amalgam s produced m the mercury cathode cl
sn the manufacture of NaQH Both zinc and sodum amalgams are used 5
strong reducing agents in the laboratory Many of the first row transition
«elements do not form amalgams, and Ma Cu and Zn are the only ones 10
do 30 The heaver transition elements form amalgams quite readily

In a vertical group inthe d block the second and third row elements are
very similar in both size and chemical properties and differ from the fist
sow element in ths group Zn and Cd are very similar and difer
considerably from Hg

OXIDES

ZnO 1s the only oxide of commercial importance Its main use 1s 19 the
production of rubber since it shortens the tume taken for valcantaion {2
‘occur ZnO 1salso used as a white pigment n paint Its much less used ft
‘ths purpose than,1s T:O,, which has a higher refractive index and hence
‘a better covering power ZnO 1s the starting point for making other Zt
‘compounds such as zine stearate and zinc palmitate These tw0 co

are ‘soaps’ and are used to stabilvze plasties and to make paint dry Worl!
production of ZnO was 366500 tonnes 1n 1991
