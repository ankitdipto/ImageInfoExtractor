COMPLEXES

Zn** and Cd?* form complexes with O donor ligands and also with N and
§ donor ligands and with halide ions. Hg(+11) forms complexes with N, P
and $ donor ligands, but is reluctant to bond to O. The stability of Hg
complexes is much greater than that of the other two elements. This is
unusual because smaller ions usually complex best. No complexes are
known with x bonding ligands such as CO, NO or alkenes. However, Zn
and Cd do form complexes with CN~, e.g. [Zn(CN)4]°~. Zn complexes are
usually colourless, but Hg complexes (and to a lesser extent Cd complexes)
are often coloured because of charge transfer. Coordination numbers from
210 8 are known. Since the elements have a d'° configuration there is no
crystal field stabilization energy.

Zn"! and Cd" occur largely in four-coordination as tetrahedral complexes.
Many tetrahedral complexes are known (e.g. [MCl°", [M(H,0),}"*,
[M(NH3),)*, [M(NH3),(CI)2], [Zn(CN).°-, [Zn(pyridine),Clh] and
{Cd(pyridine)»Cl,}). In [Zn(NCS),]°* the ligand is bonded through N, but
in [Cd(SCN),}** the ligands bond through S.

Zn and Cd form several six-coordinate octahedral complexes such as
[M(H20)6]?*, [M(NH3)o]?*, [M(ethylenediamine);]** and [Cd(ortho-
phenanthroline)3]?*. The octahedral complexes of Zn are not very stable,
but Cd forms octahedral complexes more readily and they are more stable
than those of Zn because Cd is larger.

Most Hg" complexes are octahedral. These are appreciably distorted
with two short bonds and four long bonds..In the extreme this distortion
Tesults in only two bonds. Examples of this are the compounds Hg(CN)2
and Hg(SCN), and the complex [Hg(NH3)2]Clz. The latter contains the
linear [H;N—Hg—NH;]** ion. Hg"! also forms some tetrahedral com-
plexes (e.g. [Hg(SCN),]*~ and halide complexes such as Ka[Hgl4]). The
latter is used as Nessler's reagent for the detection and quantitative deter-
mination of ammonia in solution. Nessler’s reagent gives a yellow colour or
brown precipitate with concentrations as low as | part per million of NH3.
This test is used on drinking water. The presence of NH ions in water at
this concentration is not in itself harmful, but it may indicate contamina-
tion of the water with sewage. Mercury(II) chloride in solution is mainly
HeCh. but [HgCl,?> can be formed if CI7 are in excess. In the Hg
complexes, two ligands are held more strongly than the others, and some
ammine complexes lose ammonia from the solid.

Two-coordinate complexes are rare for Zn and Cd.

_ Three-coordination is rare but an example is [Hgl3]~. Five-coordination
'S not common, but examples include [CdCl.]°~ and [Zn(terpyridyl)Clo],
which have a trigonal bipyramid shape. There are a few complexes with
coordination numbers of 7 and 8. Examples of coordination number 8 are
[Zn(NO3),P> and {Hg(NO;),}°>. These involve bidentate O donor ligands
