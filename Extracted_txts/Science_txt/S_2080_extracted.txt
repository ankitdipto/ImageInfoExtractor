Zine forms baste zinc acetate (CHjCOO), Zn,O, a complex very hike
basic beryllium acetate both in structure and properties (see Figure 28 !)

MERCURY(+]) COMPOUNDS

Only a few Hg(1) compounds (formerls called mercurous compounds) ate
Known They contain the ion (Fg—He)"*. not Hg" The io Hg atoms
are bonded together using the 6s orbitals Mereury 1 umgue an forming
stable dinuclear metal ions The only other metals which form dimacleat
tons ate (Zn—Zn)** and (Cd—Cd)** ‘These tons are unstable and haxe
only been detected spectroscopically in melts of Zn/ZnCl and CdiCéCl,

Mercury(t) compounds can be made by seducing the mercury(I) st
vith the metat Alternatively mercury(I) nitrate can be made by disolting
Hg in dilute HNO Other salts are made from this by adding NaH(COs (0
