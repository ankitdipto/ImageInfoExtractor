Hg*—> Hg -E° = +0.85V
and [Hg)* > Hg = E° = +0.79V

The reduction potential diagram shows that [Hg,]°* is stable to dispropor-
tionation by a small margin under standard conditions.

Hg** + He = Hg3* — E® = $0.13 V
The equilibrium constant K for the reaction can be calculated from the
potential E°:

concentration (Hg,)**
K = > = approx. 170
concentration Hg?* PP

Thus solutions of mercury(I) compounds contain one Hg** ion for every
170 [Hg}°* ions. The equilibrium is finely balanced. If a reagent is added
which removes Hg?* from this mixture (by forming either an insoluble
compound or a complex) then the equilibrium moves to the left. Under
these conditions (Hg3)°* ions disproportionate completely into Hg**
and Hg. For example, the addition of OH™ or S$?” ions gives a precipitate
of HgO and Hg, or HgS and Hg. The absence of several mercury(I)
compounds such as hydroxides, sulphides and cyanides is because they
precipitate Hg’*, and allow disproportionation to occur. Conversely,
mercury(I) compounds can be made by heating mercury(II) compounds
with at least a 50% excess of Hg.

HgCl, + Hg > [Hg2]**Ch

In qualitative analysis the presence of Hg2Cl, in solution is confirmed by
the formation of a black precipitate when treated with NH,OH. The dark
tesidue may be Hg(NH3)Cl2, HgNH2Cl or Hg»NCI- HO or a mixture of
all three together with Hg.

Mercury(I) ions form few complexes. This is because of the large size of
the binuclear ion, and because most ligands cause disproportionation.

, Mercury is unique in the Hg(+1) state in that it consists of two directly
linked metal atoms. The mercury(I) ion thus has the structure [Hg—Hg]**
Evidence for this comes from several sources:

X-ray diffraction

The crystal Structures of several mercury(I) compounds have been
determined by X-ray diffraction. For example. consider Hg'Cl. If the
compounds comprised Hg* and CI the structure should contain alternate
Hg” and Cl- ions. It does not have this structure, but contains a linear
arrangement Cl—Hg—Hg—-Cl. The other Hg! compounds also have
Hg—He pairs rather than discrete Hg* ions. The He—Hg bond length
Varies in different compounds: [Hgo]F,. 2.51 A: [Hg]Cls, 2.53 A: [Hg2]Bro.
