Equihbram constant

Equihbrium constants can be measured and prouide evidence about the
species present Mercury(I) compounds can often be made from the cor-
responding mercury({t) compound by treatment with mercury If the
reaction ts
Hg(NO.)> + Hg + 2HgNOy
He? + Hp — 2g"

then by the law of mass action

 

IEEE = cote
Experiments have shown histo be unt If however
Hie + Hg (gg then THEI = constant

‘This has been verified experimentally, thus proving that mercury(I) sons
are (Hg;)**, that 1s (Hg—Hg)"*

 

Concentration cell

Measurement of the emf of 2 concentration cell of mercury(I) mitate
shows that the mercury(l) 10n carnes two positive charges For the cell
