Raman spectra

The Raman spectrum for mercury(I) nitrate contains the lines characteris-
tic of the NO3 group. Similar lines appear in the spectra of many other
nitrates. Mercury(I) nitrate has an extra line in the spectrum at 171.7 em7!
which is attributed to the Hg—Hg bond. Homonuclear stretching of a
diatomic species is Raman active but not infra-red active. This was the first
example of Raman spectra identifying a new species.

Magnetic properties

All mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic both in the solid state and in
solution, Hg* would have an unpaired electron and would be paramagne-
tic, but in [Hg—Hg]** the electrons are all paired and it should therefore
be diamagnetic.

Cryoscopic measurements

The depression of freezing point produced depends on the number of
particles dissolved in the liquid. The observed depression fits for mer-
cury(I) nitrate ionizing into Hg3* and two NO} ions, not into Hg* and
NO3.

POLYCATIONS

The compounds Hg,(AICl,). and Hg4(AsFg)2 contain cations with three
and four mercury atoms joined together in an almost linear chain. They
can be made by reactions such as:

2Hg + HgCh + 2AICI, > Hg,(AICl4)2
3Hg + 3AsFs5 > Hg3(AsFe)2 + ASF3
4Hg + 3AsFs > Hgs(AsFo)2 + ASF3

Their crystal stuctures give the following bond lengths in the cations:

A 2+ & 2+
[rig vag 255A] [pag2S7A rag 2A g257A te]
The bond lengths, though not identical, are within the range shown in
Most mercury(I) compounds. The nature of the bonding in these ions is of
interest. In the mercury(I) Hg3* ion the two Hg atoms are bonded together
using the 6s orbital. This idea cannot be extended to three or four Hg
atoms. If the mercury(I) ion was made from a Hg?* ion with a Hg atom
Coordinated to it Hg** «Hg, then this might be extended to the trimer Hg
fone = Hg. However, it is hard to see how a linear tetramer could be
Ne . The answer may lie in multi-centre bonding. An unusual solid
[Hg> s<(AsF,)}, can be made in liquid SO:

6n(Hg) + 3n(AsFs) > [Hgy xs(ASFo)Jn + 2(ASF3)
