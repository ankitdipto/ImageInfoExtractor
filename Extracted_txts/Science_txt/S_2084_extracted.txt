‘The erystal structure contains chains of Hg atoms in the ¥ and y directions
The compound conducts clectrety almost as well Js mercury and yt
becomes a superconductor at low temperatures

ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS
The first organometathe compound was Zenes salt AIPY(n” —
GHJCKHLO” Thus was solated 1a B25 but cemauned & chemat
cunosity The first useful organometallic compounds were prepared by Sir
Edward Frankland 1m 1849 and they found use m organic syathess
‘These were of two types

1 zine slhyls ZR and

2 alkyl zinc halides R2nX

They were onginally prepared as follows

ER + Zn SEMPER, BeZQIM, ErZn + Znly
‘The ceaction works best with alkyl of aryl rodides, but 1 1s cheaper to use
RBr with a Zn/Cu alloy COs may also be used as the inert atmosphere
‘The products ZaRs are exther covalent liquids oF Jow melting solids The
alkyl zinc halides RZnX apparently have the structure
R x
Nos
Zn—Za
yo.
R x

‘These were used in organte syntheses before Grignard reagents RMgX
were discovered Grignard compounds are usually more convenient 10
‘make and use

Oregano compounds of Zn and Cd (and also Lt and Mg) alt decompose
rapidly on contact with water and air The Zn and Cd alkyls are
conventently prepared from Grignard or alhy! Mthium reagents or ally!
mercury compounds

CAC, + 2RMgCI—» CAR: + 2MeChe
ZnCl; + 2RLi— ZnR; + 2LrC
Zn + HgR;—> ZaR, + Hg
If required the Grgnard type compounds can be made as follows
CARs + Cally 2RCUL

RiZn and R,Cd react mn a simulae way to Grignard reagents and inhi
alkyls, but are less reactive and are unaffected by CO; Their lesser
reactity allows selective alkylation
