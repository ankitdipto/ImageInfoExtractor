The most important use of organocadmium compounds is to produce
ketones. This also exploits the lower reactivity of the Cd alkyls, as
Grignard reagents would react further with the ketone produced.

A large number of organomercury compounds are known of types RZHg
and monomeric RHgX. They are much more stable to air and water than
the zinc compounds. They are easily made by Grignard reactions with
HgCl, in tetrahydrofuran, or by reacting HgX, with a hydrocarbon:

HgCl, + RMgBr > RHgCi + MgCl. + 4MgBr2
RHgCl + RMgBr > R2Hg + $MgCl, + 4MgBr,
HX, + RH > RHgX + HX
Arylmercury compounds may be prepared from mercury(II) acetate:
CoH + (CH3COO)2Hg > CsHs: HgOOC- CH;

phenylmercury(I1) acetate
Organomercury compounds are important for the preparation of organo-
metallic compounds of Groups 1 and 2, Al, Ga, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Se, Te.
Zn and Cd.

R,Hg + 2Na > 2RNa + Hg

HgR2 compounds are covalent liquids or low melting solids They are
extremely poisonous. RHgX compounds are solids, and they are ex-
tremely toxic. Many RHgX compounds, particularly EtHgCl, PhHgCl and
PhHgOOC > CHs, and Hg(Me), have been widely used for treating seeds,
and as pesticides and fungicides.

Mercury(II) salts will add to double bonds in alkenes.

Mercury(II) salts also act as catalysts in the hydration of alkynes (acety-
lenes). The production of ethanal (acetaldehyde) from ethyne (acetylene)
1s commercially important.

BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF ZINC

Zn has an important biological role in the enzyme systems of animals and
Plants. Humans contain about 2 g of Zn. This is the second largest amount
ofa transition metal after Fe, 4g. There are about 20 enzymes containing
Zn, and some of the best known are as follows:
