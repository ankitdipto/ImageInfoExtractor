2. Carboxypeptidase which 1s present mn the pancreatic ice 1s involved
inthe diges 10n of protems by animals. and protein metabolism n plats
ang animals The enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of the termtal
peptide (amide) link at the carboxyl end of the peptide chain The
enzyme 1s selective It works only when the group R in the termimal

‘TOXICITY OF CADMIUM AND MERCURY

{is strange that Zins an essential element for hfe but thatthe other 1¥°
elements inthe group Cd and Hg are both extremely tox The me!
‘threat from Cd is in places near Zn smelters as Cd may escape as dust wilt
flue gases The manufacture of NuCé battenes has eaused problems
‘Sweden and Japan ‘Theres also concern at the amount of Cd in ogarete
smoke If Ca is ingested 11 accumolates im the kidneys It causes
function of the kadneys and also replaces Zn in some enzymes thus pte
‘venting them from working

‘Mercury vapour 18 toxic and af anhaled ean cause giddiness tremo™s
