PROBLEMS (CHAPTERS 19-28)
1 Explain why La,Oy 1s not reduced by AL
2. Explan why TiO; 1s white but TiCly s violet

3. Draw the structure of rutile What 1s the coordination number of the
rons and what 1s the radius ratio?

4. Desenbe how Tr metals obtained, and explarn why it has been called
the wonder metal

5. Desenbe the uses of titanium compounds in paint, sn the polymenza
tion of ethene and in the fixation of dinitrogen

6 Explain why the physical and chemiesl properties of Zr and Ht
compounds are much more stmilar than the properties of Tr and Zt

7. Desenbe what happens when the pH of a solution contesning (VO)
rons 1s gradually reduced
8 When ammonium vanadate 1 heated with oxahe ac solution, 2
compound (2) 1s formed A sample of (2) was utrated wath KNtO,
solution in hot acidic solution “The resulting liquid was reduced with
803, the excess SO, boiled off, and the liquid again titrated wath
KMn0,
The ratio of the volumes of KMnO, used in the two titrations Was
51 What conclusions can you make regerding the nature of
compound (Z) (KMnO, oxidizes all oxidation states of vanadiim to
vanadium (+V) SO, reduces vanadium (+V) to vanadium (#1V) )
