PROBLEMS (CHAPTERS 19-28)

. Give equations to show the reactions between CrO, Cr203 and CrO3

with aqueous acids and alkalis.

|. Describe the structures of chromium(I) acetate and copper(II)

acetate, and comment on any unusual features they have.

. How may the last traces of dioxygen be removed from dinitrogen?

. Manganese has been described as ‘the most versatile element’. Explain

this, and show the similarities and differences between the chemistry
of manganese and rhenium.

. Explain why [Mn(OH),]** is pale pink, MnO, is black and MnO; is

intensely coloured purple.

. Explain why a green solution of potassium manganate(V1) KzMnOq

turns purple and a brown solid is precipitated when carbon dioxide is
bubbled into the solution.

. Draw the crystal structure of ReO3, and compare it with the perovskite

structure.

. Why do metals such as iron corrode, and how may this be prevented?

. Describe how iron is extracted from its ores, and how it is converted

into steel.

. What are pig iron, wrought iron, mild steel, high carbon steel and

Stainless steel?

. Predict the electronic arrangement on the metal from crystal field

splitting and the nature of the ligands in the following complexes:
(a) [Fe(H20).]?*, (b) [Fe(CN).]*~ and (c) [Fe(CN).}°~. How many
unpaired electrons are there in each complex, and what would you
expect their magnetic moments to be?

Iron pentacarbony! has a trigonal bipyramidal structure, yet the °C
nmr spectrum of Fe(7CO)s shows only a single peak even when the
*sample is held at low temperatures. Two peaks would be expected for
a trigonal bipyramidal molecule. (The °C nucleus has a spin of 3 and
behaves in much the same way as a proton in nmr.) Explain the
unusual spectrum.

Compare and contrast the structures of haem, vitamin By. and
chlorophyll.

Outline the essential features involved in the binding of O, to the
myoglobin molecule.

. Write a critical account of the various ways in which the nine elements

in the iron, cobalt and nickel groups have been grouped together for
comparison purposes.

- Draw and name the possible isomers of the following complexes: (a)

{Co(en),}°*, (b) [Co(en)s(SCN).]*
