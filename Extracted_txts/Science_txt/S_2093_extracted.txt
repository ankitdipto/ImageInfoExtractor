OXIDATION STATES

‘The sum of the first three sontzation energies for cach element are gwen m
Table 29 2 The values are low Thus the oxidation state (+1) isomie and
Ln dominates the chemistry of these elements The Ln”? and Ln** ont
‘that do occur are always less stable than Ln (In this chapter the symbol
Laas used to denote any of the lanthanides ) In yust the same way 35 for
cother elements the higher oxdation states occur m the fluondes and
oxides. and the lower oxidation states occur m the other halides. par
‘wcularly bromides and iodides Oxidation numbers (+11) and (+1V) do
‘occur particulatly when they fend to

1 a noble gas configuration € g Ce** (/*)
2 ahalf filed shell e g Eu"* and TO (7)
3 a completely filled fievel eg Yb (/")

In addition (+11) and (+1V) states exist for elements that are close to these
states Thus Sm?* and Tm?” occur with f® and f"" arrangements and Pr’?
and Na" have f! and f# arrangements. The (+ ill state ss always the most
common and the most stable The only (+1V) and (+I) states whch have
any aqueous chemistry are Ce** Sm** Eu?* and Yb?"

‘The lanthanide elements resemble each other much more closely than do

effectively have only one stable oxidation state (+111) Thus i ths sents
