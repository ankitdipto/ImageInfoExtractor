ABUNDANCE AND NUMBER OF ISOTOPES |

The lanthanide elements are not particularly rare. Cerium is about as
abundant as copper. Apart from promethium, which does not occur in
nature, all the elements are more abundant than iodine.

The abundance of the elements and the number of naturally occurring
isotopes vary regularly (Table 29.3). Elements with an ‘even atomic
number (i.e, an even number of protons in the nucleus) are more abundant
than their neighbours with odd atomic numbers (Harkins' rule). Elements
with even atomic numbers also have more stable isotopes. Elements with
odd atomic numbers never have more than two stable isotopes. Through-
out the periodic table the stability of a nucleus is related to both the
number of neutrons and the number of protons in the nucleus (Table 29.4).

Element 61, promethium, does not occur naturally. It was first made and
Studied at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, USA, in 1946. Its absence may be
explained by Mattauch’s rule. This states that if two elements with con-
Secutive atomic numbers each have an isotope of the samie weight, one of
the isotopes will be unstable. Since elements 60 and 62 have seven isotopes
each, there are not many stable mass numbers available for promethium.
clement 61 (Table 29.5).

_ According to Mattauch’s rule, if promethium is to have a stable isotope.
ont have a mass number outside the range 142-150. The only isotopes
of Pm which have been made so far are radioactive.
