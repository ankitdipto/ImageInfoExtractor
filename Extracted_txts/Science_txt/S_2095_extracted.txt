EXTRACTION AND USES

World production of rare exth minerals was $1000 tonnes im 1992
containing 47900 tonnes of Fanthanide oxides Ln Ox The man sources of
minerals are the USA 27% Chins 20% Australia bY and India 6%

1 Monazite sands the most smportant and most widespread mineral It
‘accounts for 78% of the rare earths mned Before 1960 monazste WS
the only source of lanthanides It ss a musture contaming mostly ta
phosphate and tnvalent phosphates of the lighter lanthanide elements
{Ce Pr and Na) In addition xt contains smaller amounts of ¥ and the |
heavier lanthanides and thorium phosphate Th is weakly radioactive
