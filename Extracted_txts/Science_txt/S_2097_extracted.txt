"THE LANTHANIDE SERIES )

 

SEPARATION OF THE LANTHANIDE ELEMENTS

“The properties of metal ons are determined by their size and charge The
lanthanides are all typically tavalent and are almost dentcal in size, and
so their chemical properttes are almost identical The separation of one
Ianthanide from another 1s an exceedingly dificult task, aimostas dificult
as the separation of wotopes of one element The classical methods of
separation expfoit slight differences in baste properties stability or
solubility These are outlined below However, in recent years the only
methods used are 1on exchange and valency change

Preciprtation

‘With a limited amount of precipitating agent the substance with the lowest
solubility 1s precipitated most rapidly and most completely Suppose
hydroxyl wons are added to a solution containing a muxture of La(NOWs
“The weakest base Lu(OH), 1s precipitated fist, and the strongest base
La(OH) is preesptated last The preenpitate contains more ofthe elentems
atthe nght of the series Thus the solution contains more of the elemetsat
the left of the senes The precipitate can be filtered off Only partial
separation ss effected, but the preeptate ean be redissolved in HNO, and
the process repeated to obtain greater punty

‘Thermal reaction

If mmxture of Ln(NO4)s 1 fused, a temperature wil be reached wher the
Jeast baste mtrate changes to the oxide. The moxture 1s feached with watet
‘The nitrates dissolve and can be filtered off, leaving the insoluble oxides
‘The oxides ate dissolved in HNOs and the process repeated

Fractional crystallization

‘Ths can be used to separate lanthanide salts The solubility decreases fom
Lato Lu Thus sehs at the Lu end of the seres wall crystallize out fist
Nitrates, sulphates, bromates, perchlorates and oxalates have all been wd
4s also have double salts such as Ln(NOs), 3Mg(NOs); 24H,0 bectust
they crystalize well The process needs repeating many tues to obt3!
good separations Non aqueous solvents such as diethyl ether have DE#?
bused to separate Nd(NOs) and Pr(NOs)s

Complex formation

‘A snture of lanthanide 10ns 9 treated with a complexing agent sot
EDTA (ethylenediamnetetraaceic aid) All the rons form complex
‘Those tons at the right hand side af the lanthanide series such as Lu'* (o™
the strongest complexes as they have the smalest rons Oxalats of the
Tnnthanides ate insoluble However addition of oxalate sons to ts
solution does not pie a precipitate since the L™ rons are all comple**¢
with EDTA
