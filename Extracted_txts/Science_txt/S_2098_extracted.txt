If some acid is added to the solution, the least stable EDTA complexes are
dissociated. This releases ions at the left hand side of the series Ce>*, Pr*,
Nd** which are immediately precipitated as the oxalates. These are filtered
off. Separation is not complete, so the oxalates are redissolved and the
process repeated many times. . .

Solvent extraction

The heavier Ln** ions are more soluble in tri-n-butylphosphate than are
the lighter Ln** ions. Their solubilities in water and ionic solvents,
however, are reversed. The ratios of the partition coefficients of La(NO3)3
and Gd(NO3)3 between a solution of the metal ions in strong HNO; and
tri-n-butylphosphate is 1: 1.06. This difference is quite small, but by using
a continuous counter-current apparatus’a very large number of partitions
can be performed automatically. This is much less tedious than performing
10000 or 20000 crystallizations. Kilogram quantities of 95% pure Gd have
been obtained by this method. The technique was originally developed in
the early days of atomic energy to separate and identify the lanthanide
elements produced by fission of uranium.

Valency change

A few lanthanides have oxidation states of (+IV) or (+II). The properties
of Ln** or Ln?* are so different from those of Ln** that separation is fairly
easy.

Cerium can be separated from lanthanide mixtures quite easily as it is
the only lanthanide which has Ln** ions stable in aqueous solution.
Oxidizing a solution containing a mixture of Ln** ions with NaOCl! under
alkaline conditions produces Ce**. Because of the higher charge, Ce‘* is
much smaller and less basic than Ce?* or any other Ln°*. The Ce** is
separated by carefully controlled precipitation of CeO, or Ce(IOs)s,
leaving the trivalent ions in solution.

Alternatively Ce** can readily be extracted from other Ln°* lanthanides
by solvent extraction in HNO solution using tributyl phosphate. Ninety-
nine per cent pure Ce can be obtained in one stage from a mixture con-
taining 40% Ce.

Ina similar way the properties of Eu2* are very different from those of
Ln**. Europium sulphate Eu2*SO3~ resembles the Group 2 sulphates and
'sinsoluble in water. Ln** sulphates are soluble. If a solution of Ln°* ions
1s reduced electrolytically using a mercury cathode, or by using zinc
amalgam, then Eu?* will be produced. If H,SOz is present EuSO, will be
