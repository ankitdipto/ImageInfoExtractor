chemical properties of the group are essentially the properties of trivalent
ionic compounds.

The sum of the first three ionization energies varies with minima at La**,
Gd?* and Lu** which are associated with attaining an empty, half full or
full f shell. Maxima occur at Eu** and Yb** associated with breaking a half
full or full shell.

The standard reduction potentials (E°) are all high (Table 29.2). They
vary in a regular way over a small range from —2.48 to ~2.26 volts,
depending on the size of the ions.

The lanthanides are all much more reactive than is Al (E° = —1.66 volts)
and are slightly more reactive than Mg (E° = —2.37 volts). Thus they react
slowly with cold water, but more rapidly on heating.

2Ln + 6H,0 > 2Ln(OH)3 + 3H2

The hydroxides Ln(OH); are precipitated as gelatinous precipitates by the
addition of NH,OH to aqueous solutions. These hydroxides are ionic and
basic. They are less basic than Ca(OH), but more basic than Al(OH);
which is amphoteric. The metals, oxides and hydroxides all dissolve in
dilute acids, forming salts. Ln(OH)3 are sufficiently basic to absorb CO
from the air and form carbonates. The basicity decreases as the ionic radius
decreases from Ce to Lu. Thus Ce(OH)s is the most basic, and Lu(OH)s,
which is the least basic, is intermediate between scandium and yttrium in
basic strength. The decrease in basic properties is illustrated by the
hydroxides of the later elements dissolving in hot concentrated NaOH,
forming complexes.

Yb(OH); + 3NaOQH > 3Na* + [Yb(OH)6°7
Lu(OH); + 3NaOH — 3Na* + [Lu(OH),}*~

The metals tarnish readily in air, and on heating in O, they all give
oxides Ln203. Yb and Lu form a protective oxide film, which prevents the
bulk of the metal forming the oxide unless it is heated to 1000°C. The one
exception is Ce which forms Ce'YO, rather than CeO . The oxides are
ionic and basic. Basic strength decreases as the ions get smaller.

The metals react with Ha, but often require heating up to 300-400°C to
start the reaction. The products are solids of formula LnH>. Eu and Yb
both have a tendency to form divalent compounds and EuH, and YbH) are
salt-like hydrides and contain M2* and two H~. The others all form
hydrides LnH; which are black, metallic and conduct electricity. These are
better formulated as Ln**, 2H7 and an electron which occupies a
conduction band. In addition Yb forms a nonstoichiometric compound
@pproximating to YbH2s. The hydrides are remarkably stable to heat,
often up to 900°C. They are decomposed by water, and react with oxygen.

CeH2 + 2H20 — CeO. + 2H2

 

fi drides’ take up H if heated under pressure. and all except Eu
om salt-like hydrides LnH made up of Ln** and three H~. These do not
ve a delocalized electron, and do not show metallic conduction.
