‘The anhydrous halides MX, can be made by heating the metal and
halogen or by heating the oxide with the appropriate ammonium halide

“The fluorides are very insoluble and ean be precipitated from solutions
‘of Ln?* by addition of Na°F or HF This as used as a test for the
lanthanides in qualitative analysis However with excess F the smaller
fanthanide rons may form soluble complexes (LaF(H,O),{°* THe chfonides
are deliquescent and soluble and crystallize with sx or seven molecules of
‘water of erystallzation If the hydrated hahdes are heated they form
oxohalides instead of dehydrating to anhydrous halides

Heating CeXs (HzO) results im CeO The bromides and rodides are
similar fo the chlorides

‘Atelevated temperatures the lanthanides react with B_ giving LaB, and
LBs

On ate melting the metals with C in an ynert atmosphere they form
carbides of stoichiometry LnC, and Lns(Ca)s ‘The carbides can also be
made by reducing Ln.O, with C in an elecne furnace LnCz are more
reactwe than CaCy They react with water giving ethyne and also some
hydrogen CoH, and C,H, They also show metailic conductwity They do
rot contain Ln( +l) and are best described as acetyhdes of Ln°* and C3

At elevated temperatures the metals also react with N PAs Sband Bi

A wide vanety of oxosalts are known including mutrates carbonates
