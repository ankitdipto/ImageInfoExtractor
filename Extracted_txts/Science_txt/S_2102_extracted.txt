the hydrated ion. Aqueous cerium(IV) solutions can be prepared by
oxidizing a Ce** solution with a very strong oxidizing agent such as
ammonium peroxodisulphate (NH4)2S20x. Ce(+1V) is also used in organic
reactions, for example the oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes and ketones at
the a-carbon atom. The common compounds are CeO, (white when pure)
and CeQ>-(H20),, (a yellow gelatinous precipitate). CeO2 can be ob-
tained by heating the metal, or Ce(OH), or Ce}!\(oxalate),, in air. CeO,
has a fluorite type of structure. It is insoluble in acids and alkalis, but
dissolves if reduced. giving Ce** solutions.

Ce(SOx)2 (formerly called ceric sulphate) is well known and is yellow
like K,CrOy. CeF, is obtained from CeF; and F>. It is white, and is
rapidly hydrolysed by water. It has a three-dimensional crystal structure
with the metal at the centre of a square antiprism. A number of complexes
are stable, for example ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (NH4)2[Ce(NOs)o]-
Thé crystal stricture is unusual and contains bidentate NOZ groups. The
Ce atom has a coordination number of 12, and the shape is an icosahedron.
This structure is stable even in solution. Two of the NO}Z ions may be
replaced by phosphine ligands Ph;PO, giving a neutral 10-coordinate
complex (Ce!¥(NO3),(PhsPO)3].

The other (+IV) compounds are not stable in water and are known
only as oxides, fluorides and a few fluoro complexes. Thus PrO2, PrFs,
Na,[PrF,], TbO2, TbF,, TeO2, DyFy and Cs3[DyF;] are all known.

The elements Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also form (+IV) states. These are
generally unstable, occur only as solids, and are found as fluorides or
oxides which may be nonstoichiometric.
