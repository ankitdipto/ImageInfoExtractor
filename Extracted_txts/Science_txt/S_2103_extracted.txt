‘One mayor difference between Ev and Ca s that the dihalides EuX, have a
‘magnetic moment of 7 9 Bohr magnetons corresponding to seven unpaured
electrons, whereas Ca compounds are dramagnete

‘The couple Eu'*|Eu2* has a standard reduction potential of ~0 41
volts Ths is about the same as for Cr°"|Cr°", and these are both about the
strongest reducing agents that donot reduce water

‘Yb! and Sm?” can be prepared by electrolyte reduction of their
trivalent rons in aqueous solution However, the La™ rons are readily
oxidized by air These two elements form hydroxides, carbonates, halides,
sulphates and phosphates

‘The states Nd(+I1), Pm(-+I1), Sm(+) and Gd(+11) are only found in
solid dihalides LnClz and Laly These dihalides can be made by reducing
the tahaide with hydrogen, with the metal, or with sodium amalgam The
dihalides such as Lal; and Nal tend to be nonstoichiometnic They show
retallic conduction, and are better represented as La?* + 21” + electron

‘A detailed study of the ted 1onvzation energy shows the stability of
half filled and completely filed shell The tontzation energies also suggest
that there may also be extra stability assoctated with a three quarters filled
shell

SOLUBILITY

Salts ofthe lanthanides usually contain water of erystallization Solubrty
depends on the small difference between the lattice energy and the solva
tion energy. and there 1s no obvious trend in the group ‘The solubsty of
many of the salts follows the pattern of Group 2 elements Thus the
‘chlorides and nitrates are soluble in water and the oxalates carbonates,
and fluores are almost insoluble Unlike Group 2, however the sulphates
are soluble Many of the lanthamdes form double salts with the corre-
sponding Group 1 or ammonium salts, eg Na;SOsLnx(SO,)s 8H;0 and
as these double salts crystallize well, they have been used to separate the
lanthanides from one another

COLOUR AND SPECTRA

Many trvalent lanthanide rons are strikingly coloured both an the solid
state and m aqueous solution ‘The colour seems to depend on the number
of unpaired f electrons Elements with (1) f electrons often have a simular
colour to those with (I4 ~ n) felectrons (See Table 29 6 ) However the
‘elements in other valency states do nor all have colours sumar to thei
ssoelectrome 3+ counterparts (Table 29 7)

Colour anses because light of a parucular wavelength s absorbed mn the
visible region The wavelength absorbed corresponds to the energy re
quired to promote an electron toa higher energy level In the lanthanides
spi orbit coupling 1s more important than erystal field splitting. In the
spectra of transition metals, crystal field splitting s of mayor importance
All but one of the lanthanide tons show absorptions inthe visible or near
