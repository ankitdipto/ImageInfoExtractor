UV regions of the spectrum. The exception is Lu>* which has a full f shell.
These colours arise from f—f transitions. Strictly these transitions are
Laporte forbidden (since the change in the subsidiary quantum number is
zero). Thus the colours are pale because they depend on relaxation of the
tule. The f orbitals are deep inside the atom. Thus they are largely shielded
from environmental factors such as the nature and number of ligands which
form the complexes, and from vibration of the ligands. Thus the position of
the absorption band ‘i.e. the colour) does not ‘change with different
ligands. Vibration of the ligands changes the external fields. However, this
only splits the various spectroscopic states by about 100cm™!, so the
absorption bands are unusually sharp. The lanthanides are used for wave-
length calibration of instruments because of their sharp absorption bands.
For an f electron the subsidiary quantum number / = 3, so m, may have
Values 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3. Thus a large number of transitions are
usually possible. This is in marked contrast to the transition elements
Where dd spectra give absorption bands whose position changes from
ligand to ligand, and the width of the peak is greatly broadened because of
the vibration of the ligands. It is also possible to get transitions from the 4f
to the Sd level, Such transitions give broader peaks and their position is
affected by the nature of the ligands.
d Absorption Spectra of lanthanide ions are useful both for the qualitative
letection and the quantitative estimation of lantnanides. Lanthanide ele-
ments are sometimes used as biological tracers for drugs in humans and
animals. This is because lanthanide elements can quite easily be followed
