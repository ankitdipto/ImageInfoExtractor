"THE LANTHANIDE SERIES

 

1m the body by spectroscopy, because their peaks are narrow and very
characterstie

‘Ce and Yb?* are colourless because they do not absorb in the visible
region However, they show exceptionally strong absorption in the UV
region, because of transitions from 4f to Sd Absorption is very stong for
two reasons Since Al = | this1s an allowed transition and so gues stronger
absorption than forbidden f-f transitions Furthermore promotion of
clectrons in these tons 1s easier than for other rons The electronic con
figuration of Ce** 1s! and Yo" 1sf* Loss of one electron gives the extra,
stabilty of an empty or half full shell fd peaks are broad, in contrast to
the narrow f-F peaks

Charge transfer spectra are possible due to the transfer of an electron
from the ligand to the metal This ts more probable sf the metal sna high
fondation state or the ligand has reducing properties Charge transfer
usually produces intense colours The strong yellow colour of Cet
solutions arises from charge transfer rather than f—fspectra The blood red
colour of Sm** 1s also due to charge transfer

MAGNETIC PROPERTIES

La™* and Ce have an f* configuration and Lu has an f™ configura
tion These have no unparred electrons. and are diamagnetic All other f
states contam unpaired electrons and are therefore paramagnetic

‘The magnetic moment of transition elements may be calculated from the

equation
Msn) = SIS > FLIED

Hose) 18 the magnetic moment in Bohr magnetons calculated using both
the spin and orbital momentum contnbutions. $ 1s the resultant spin
quantum number and Ls the resultant orbital momentum quantum
rnumber For the first row transition elements, the orbital contnbution ts
usually quenched out by interaction withthe electric fields of the ligands im
nts environment Thus as a first approximation the magnetic moment can
be calculated using the simple spin only formula (js 1 the spun only
magnetic moment 1n Bohr magnetons 5 1s the resultant spin quantum
‘umber and n 1s the number of unpaired electrons )
