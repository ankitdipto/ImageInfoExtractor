electrons. Thus the magnetic effect of the motion of the electron in its
orbital is not quenched out. Thus the magnetic moments must be calcu-
lated taking into account both the magnetic moment from the unpaired
electron spins and that from the orbital motion. This also happens with the
second and third row transition elements. However, the magnetic proper-
ties of the lanthanides are fundamentally different from those of the
transition elements. In the lanthanides the spin contribution S and orbital
contribution L couple together to give a new quantum number J.

J=L-S wherr the shell is less than half full
and J=L+S when the shell is more than half full

The magnetic moment pis calculated in Bohr magnetons (BM) by:

w= gyIU +1)

where

MSHI LL +1)
galt wg +1)

Figure 29.2 shows the calculated magnetic moments for the lanthanides
using both the simple spin only formula, and the coupled spin plus orbital
momentum formula. For most of the elements there is excellent agreement
between the calculated values using the coupled spin + orbital momentum
formula and experimental values measured at 300K. The range of experi-
mental values are shown as bars.

The agreement for Eu?* is poor, and that for Sm** is not very good. The
reason is that with Eu** the spin orbit coupling constant is only about
300cm-'. This means that the difference in energy betiveen the ground
