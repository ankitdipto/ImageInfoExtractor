state and the next state as small Thus the energy of thermal mations
sulficent to promote some electrons and partally populate the fugher
state Because of ths the magnetic properties are not solely determined by
the ground state configuration Measuring the magnetic moment at a 1ov
temperature prevents the population of higher energy levels The magnetic
rmoment of Eu'* at low temperature 1s close to zet0 as expected (The
measurement of magnetic moments is described in Chapter 17

“The unusual shape of the spin plus orbital motion curve arises because of
Hund’s third rule When the fevel sles than half full the spin and osbtal
momenta contributions work mn opposition (J = Z~ S) When the fsbellis
rote than ha fll they work vogesher (J = 1+ 8)

LANTHANIDE CONTRACTION

Covalent and ronte radu normally merease on descending a group i the
periodic table due to the presence of extra filled shells of electrons 00
moving from left to right across a period, the covalent and sonic rad
‘ecrease ‘This 18 because the extra orbital electrons incompletely shld
the extra nuclear charge Thus all the electrons are pulled in closer THE
shielding effect of electrons decreases in the order s > p > d > f The
contraction in size from one element to another is far small However
the additive effect over the 1d lanthanide elements from Ce to Luts sb0%t
O2A, and this known as the lanthanide contraction

“The hardness, melting points and bosling points of the elements all
sncrease from Ce to Lu Ths 8 because the atraction between the at0™5
nereases as the size decreases
