The properties of an ion depend on its size and its charge. The Ln?*
lanthanide ions change by only a small amount from one element to the
next (Table 29.9), and their charge is the same, and so their chemical
properties are very similar. Since Lu** is the smallest ion it is the most
heavily hydrated. Though the lanthanides do not form complexes very
extensively, since Lu** is the smallest ion the complexes formed by Lu?*
are the strongest. La?* and Ce** are the largest ions so La(OH)3 and
Ce(OH); are the strongest bases.

The lanthanide contraction reduces the radii of the last four elements in
the series below that for Y in the preceding transition series. Since the size
of the heavier lanthanide ions, particularly Dy** and Ho®**, are similar to
that of Y°* it follows that their chemical properties are also very similar.
Asa result the separation of these elements is very difficult.

lonic radii depend on how aany electrons are removed. For simplicity,
the radii of ions with the same charge are compared in Table 29.9. A
similar change in size across the series is observed if covalent radii are
compared (Table 29.10).

Because of this contraction in size across the lanthanide series, the
elements which follow in the third transition series are considerably smaller
than would otherwise be expected. The normal size increase Sc> Y > La
disappears after the lanthanides. Thus pairs of elements such as Zr/Hf,
Nb/Ta and Mo/W are almost identical in size. The close similarity of
Properties in such a pair makes chemical separation very difficult. The sizes
of the third row of transition elements are very similar to those of the
second row of transition elements (see Table 29.10). Thus the second and

thitd rows of transition elements resemble each other more closely than do
the first and second rows.
