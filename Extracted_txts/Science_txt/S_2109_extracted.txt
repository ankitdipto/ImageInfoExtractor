COMPLEXES

“The lanthanrde ions Ln™ have a high charge, which favours the formation
of complexes However, the 1ons are rather large (1 03-0 86A) compared
with the transition elements (Cr'* = @ 615A, Fe'* = 055A (low spin))
and consequently they do not form complexes very readily Complexes
‘with amines are not formed in aqueous solution because water isa stronger
ligand than the amine However. amune complexes can be made in non
‘aqueous solvents Very few stable complexes are formed with CO. CN
‘and organometalhe groups This isn contrast (0 the transition metals The
difference ances because the 4f orbitals ate well shielded and are “inside
the atom’ Thus they eannot rake part in x back bonding, whereas in the
transition elements the d orbitals are involved in x bonding The most
‘common and stable complexes are those with chetating oxygen ligands such
as citne acid, oxalic acid, EDTA’ and acetylacetone These complexes
frequently have high and variable coordination oumbers, and water or
solvent molecules are often attached t0 the central metal P-Diketone
complexes of Eu and Pr dissolved in organic solvents are used as
lanthanide shift reagents m amr spectroscopy

Coordination numbers below 6 are uncommon and occur only vith
bulky ligands such as (2 6 dimethylphens1)~ and [N(SiMex)a]” In contrast,
tothe transiton elements the coordination number 68 not common The
‘most common coordination numbers are 7 8and9 and these give a vanely
of stereochemistres Coordination numbers 10 and 12 occur watt Ul
larger (highter) lanthanides and small chelaung ligands NO} and SO?
(Table 29 11)

Complexes with monodentate oxygen ligands are much less stable than
the chelates, and tend to dissociate m aqueous solution ‘There are hardly
any complexes with nitrogen donor ligands except ethylenediamine and
NCS~, and these are decomposed by water Fluonde complexes LaF iy

‘Ce** 1s smaller and more highly charged, and [Ce(NO,)sJ?™ Is formed in
the non aqueous solvent NaOg, and ts 12 coordinate Each NO} uses 8
‘oxygen atoms to coordinate to the metal

‘The lanthanides form no complexes with x bonding ligands, and the lek
of x bonding is attributed to the unavailabihty of the Forbutals for bonding

Its difficult to explain the bonding in complexes wath high coordination
numbers If one s orbital, three p orbitals and all six d orbitals 39 the
valency shell are used for bonding. this accounts for a maximum coordima
‘uon number of 9 The higher coordination numbers of 10 and 12 presem 8
problem They imply either participation of f orbitals in bonding, or bord
‘orders of less than one

‘There are few organic compounds of the lanthanides. Alkyts and 317
‘can be made with lithium reagents in ether solution
