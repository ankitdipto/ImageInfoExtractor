PROBLEMS

1 Name the lanthanide elements in the correct order, and gwve their
chemical symbols and electromie structures

2. In what way are the observed oxidation states of the lanthanides related
to their electrome structures?

3. Why 1s it difcutt to separate compounds of the lanthanide elements?
‘What methods have been used, and which of these 1s still used?

4 Whats the lanthamde contrachon, and what are ws consequences?

5 In what ways does the filing of the 4f energy level affect the rest ofthe
petiodic table?

6 Contrast the electronic spectra of the lanthanide and transition metal
sons. Why do the lanthanide sons give rise to very sharp bands mn their

electronic spectra, and why are the magnetic properties of their com-
plexes itle affected by the nature of the ligands?

7 Compare the coordination numbers and stereochemistnes commonly
found in lanthamde complexes with those commonly found yn transition
metal complexes

8 Work out the number of unpaired electrons im the ground state of the
following rons.
