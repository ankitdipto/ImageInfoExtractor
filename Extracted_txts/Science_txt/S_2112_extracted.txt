TA ERONIC STRUCTURE AND POSITION IN THE PERIODIC

Examination of the preceding elements in the periodic table shows that
francium Fr and radium Ra belong to Groups 1 and 2 and their outermost
Clectrons must be in 7s orbitals. The next element actinium Ac begins to fill
the penultimate d shell (—6d"7s?). It has properties typical of the Sc, Y, La
nthe By analogy with what happened after La, it might be expected that
seco owing 14 elements electrons would enter the Sf shell and form a
sone inner transition series. The next 14 elements from atomic number
