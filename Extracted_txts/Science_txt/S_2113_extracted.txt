THE ACTINIDES 1

 

99 thorium t0 atomic number 103 lawrencium ate called the actnde
elements. However, the electron structures of the actinides do not follow
the simple pattern found in the lanthanides

Immediately afte La the 4f orbitals become appreciably lower im energy
than the Sd orbitals ‘Thus mn the lanthanides the electrons fil the 4forbtals
ma regular way (apart from minor differences where its possible to atta
ahalf filed shell) Tr might have been expected that after Ac the 5f orbitals
‘would become lower im energy than the 6d orbitals However, forthe fst
four actinide elements Th, Pa U and Np the difference mn energy between
S5f and 6d orbwals1s small ‘Thus these elements (and their tons) electrons
ray occupy the 5f or the 6d levels. orsometimes both Later inthe aetinide
series the Sf orbitals do become appreciably lower mn energy Thus from Pu
‘onwards the 5f shell ills a regular way and the elements become very
simifar

Before 1940 the only actinides known were Th Pa and U These
clements were (wrongly) thought to be part of the d series The reasons for
this were some chenucal similarity with groups of transition metals Th, Ze
HE Th? and Cr, Mo WU? The snerease im the number of
‘oxidation states formed by the elements Ac, Th Pa and U is reminiscent of
the saverted pyramid of oxidation states obtained with the d-block
elements (see Table 17 2) Also the increased stabihty of the Ingher states
follows the same pattern as found in the d bloc This 1s m contrast r0 the
almost uniforms (+111) oxidation state of the lanthanides U 1 the heaviest
naturally occurring element As a result of work on the atomic bomb
ddoning World War J, and of ater work on atomic energy atleast 12 more
elements have been made artificially Since these man-made elements have
atoruc cumbers higher than aU they are sometimes called the trans
turantum elements

However, as the transuranium elements were discovered and studied it
became apparent that they were block elements from

 

1 the sharpness of the lines ta thei UV=wible spectea
2. magnetie studies
3 the mereasing importance of the (+111) oxdation state
‘tts now generally accepted that the actinides are a second mner transition
sens, beginning Yath thorium and ending with lairencium
