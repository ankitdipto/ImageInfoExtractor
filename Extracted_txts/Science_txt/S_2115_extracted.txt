"THE ACTINIDES:

 

 

aesLw (excluding joao) Their properties are similar to those of the
lanthanides

“The most stable oxidation states for the fist four elements are Th (+1V),
Pa(+V) and U (+VI) ‘These high oxidation states involve using all the
‘outer electrons (including f electrons) for bonding Though Np(+Vil)
exists, 1818 oxidizing and the most stable state 5 (+V) Pu shows all the
‘oxidation states from (+HI1) to (+ VIN), but the most stable 1s Pu(IV) Am
has a range of oxidation states from (+11) 10(+V1) However, for Am and
almost afl the remaining elements the (+111) state ts the most stable

‘The (+1V) state exists forall the elements from wiTh to gyBk, and its

OCCURRENCE AND PREPARATION OF THE ELEMENTS

Allthe elements after jgPb, that i from »\B1 onwards, have unstable nucle
and undergo radioactive decay ‘The elements up to and including aU
cccur inate and have been known for 2 long time Even though they
tundergo radioactive decay. Th and U are by no means rare They make up
8 1 ppm and 23 ppm of the earth’s crust respectively ‘The fact that Th and
U occur at all on the earth 1s because the sotopes 237, 8U and “BU
