from spent U fuel rods ‘Though the main reaction m a reactor 1s fission of
24U into two smaller nucler with the release of a lot of energy. several
secondary reactions occur The U fuel rod is radiated with slow neurons
(of energy IMeV) A neutron may be captured by the nucleus in a(8 9)
reaction The neutron increases the mass number of the nucleus by one
and some energy 16 released as 7 radiation Further neutrons may be
added in a similar Way Addition of neutrons increases the neutron to
proton ratio (the nip ratio) This eventually makes the nucleus unstable
because it contains too many neutrons The nucle: decay by converting a
neutron into a proton and a B particle electron) ‘This reduces the n/p
‘ato and also creases the atomic number by one Thus a new element
formed, one place to the right n the periodic table of the orignal element
(Gee Chapter 31, under Stability and the rato of neutrons and protons)
‘When the fuel rod 1s eventually removed from the reactor, ss processed
and the new elements can be recovered. ‘There 1s not much use for NP so
sormally only Pu s recovered (Pus useful both as a nuclear fuel, and for
weapons )

‘The yield of the heavier elements 1s controlled by two factors

1 The half lves of the various wsotopes
2 By their abiiny to absorb neutrons that 1s their neutron eros section
Isotopes of elements after Pu cin be made by a succession of (119)
seactions starting with Pu in a nuclear reactor

‘The stepwase addition of slow neutrons s tedious A quicker method is
to subject the sample toa very high fux or density of fast neutrons, without
allowing time for the intermediate products to decay This happened
<during the hydrogen bomb explosions when elements fs emnstemnum 394
tweFfermium were formed As yet this does not provide a convenrent and
practicable synthetic route! In reactor fuel elements ™U adds a fast
‘seutron and then loses two neutrons
