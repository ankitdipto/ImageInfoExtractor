GENERAL PROPERTIES

Some properties ofthe elements are given in Table 30 $.The elements are
all silvery metals Their melting points are moderately high but 31
considerably lower than those for the transition elements The size ofthe
sons decreases regularly along the series, because the extra charge on the
