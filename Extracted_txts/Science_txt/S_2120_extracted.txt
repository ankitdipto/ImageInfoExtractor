nucleus is poorly screened by the f electrons. This results in an ‘actinide
contraction’ similar to the lanthanide contraction. Comparison of the Me*
ionic radii with whose for lanthanides (Table 29.9) shows that the actinide
and lanthanide ions are very similar in size. Hence their chemical
properties are alike. However, the actinides have ‘much higher densities
and a much greater tendency to form complexes.

The actinides are reactive metals like lanthanum and the lanthanides.
They react with hot water, and tarnish in air, forming an oxide coating. In
the case of Th this coating is protective, but this is not so with the others.
The metals react readily with HCI, but reaction with other acids is slower
than expected. Concentrated HNO; passivates Th, U and Pu. The metals
are basic and do not react with NaOH. They react with oxygen, the
halogens and with hydrogen. Tite hydrides are nonstoichiometric and have
ideal formulae MH, or MHa.

The metals are usually obtained by electrolysis of fused salts, or by
reducing the halides with Ca at high temperatures.

THORIUM

Thorium is by no means rare. It comprises 8.1 ppm of the earth’s crust and
is the thirty-ninth most abundant element. The main source is monazite
