‘The most stable oxidation state 5 (+V) Pa,Os 1s obtained as a white
solid by igniting Pa compounds in air The oxide 18 weakly acid a8 11s
attacked by fused alkaly Heating n a vacuum, or reduction with hydrogen
at 1500°C, gives a black nonstoichiometne phase PaO2 and eventually
PaO; Pa can be made by the action of F; on PeF, or BrF3 on P20, It
ss reactwe, and can be sublimed PaCl and oxohalides PaOX; and Pa0,X
are also known Pa(V) complexes with oxalate, citrate, tartrate, sulphate
and phosphate rons are known, and some tinustal fluoride complexes have
been studied In Rb[PaF,) the Pa atom 1s exght coordinate ‘The complex
K,{PaF,] contains nine coordinate PaFy groups These form two F bridges
to neighbouring groups on either side, giving a chain In Nas[PaFy] the
[PaF_)™ 101 1s a shightly distorted cube’ In the (+1V) state, PaO, and the
halides PaX, ate all known, and also oxohalides PaOX, Reduction of
aqueous Pa(V) solutions wath zinc amalgam or Cr gives Pa(IV), but this
ss readily oxidized by arr Spectra of PaCl, in HCl or HCIO, are sila to
those for Ce™*(4f") This suggests that Pa(IV) has af configuration, and
ss.an actinide Pa({tt) has been detected polarographically

 

‘URANIUM

‘Urannum ores were onginally mined as a source of Ra, which was wsed for
radiotherapy treatment of cancer Small amounts of U were (and stl are)
used to produce pale yellow or green coloured glass ‘This glass fuoresces
under UV light Some uranium oxide 1s used for colouring ceramics

‘The discovery of uranium fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938
stimulated a very detailed study of nuclear physics and of urannum
chemistry The liberation of energy by splitting a nucleus was of such
amportance that on 2 August 1939 Albert Einstein wrote about it t0
Franklin D_ Roosevelt (the President of the USA) He savd ‘Some recent
work by E Fermt and L. Salad leads me to expect that the element
uranium may be turned (0 a new and important source of energy i the
ummedrate future” History shows how nght he was

Ennico Fermi (a refugee from Maly working at the University of
(Chicago) used the ston process to create the ist man made nuclear chain
reaction onr2 December 1942 His reactor consisted of a pile of alternate
layers of fuel (U and UOs) and moderator (graphite) Steps of Cd served
to absorb neutrons and thus control the chain reaction Fermi used 40
tonnes of graphite, 50 tonnes of UO» and 6 tonnes of U metal

‘This led (0 the Manhattan Project 10 make atomic bombs 10 the
discovery of the transuranium elements (clements with higher atomic
‘numbers than U) and the development of nuctear power Two atomic
‘bombs were used against Japan in 1945. Urantum 1s now of great commer
‘eal importance as a nuclear fuel. In 1989 there were over 120 nuclear
power plants producing electriety n the USA, and over 400 an the rest of
the world
