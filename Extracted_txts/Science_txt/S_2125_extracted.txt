Tt 3s very difficult to start and maintain a chain reaction The neuifons

fission ‘They are much Tess effective than ‘slow neutrons with an enerS¥ of
about 2k mol! (These are sometimes called “thermal neutrons’ because
their energy 1s equivalent to thermal energy attainable at room tempera

1 The fast neutrons may be slowed down by colhsion with atom of
hydrogen deuterium or carton These materials are called moderators

Control rods are used 10 make sure that the reaction does not get out of
control The control rods absorb neutrons The rods are lowered int? the
reactor to absorb neutrons and slow it down, oF are raised out of the
reactor to allow it to speed up Control rods may be made of boron see!

Paradoncally chain reactions can only be made to result sm an exphOsion
with difficulty To get an explosion, conditions must be such that the
neutron propagation factor is greater than one This means that more that
‘one neutron from each fission i effective at causing another fission This 8

ficulties in achieving this magnitude of enrichment Normally the en€"8Y

Because of the increased surface aréa, more neutrons escape hence the
