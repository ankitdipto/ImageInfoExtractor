In a nuclear reactor, the neutron propagation factor is very close to one.
This means that only one neutron from each fission is allowed to cause
another fission. Thus the release of energy is controlled, and can be used
for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity. The surplus neutrons
may escape, or may be absorbed by the neutron absorbing control rods or
by 28U which is also present in the fuel rods.

The preparation of enriched U fuels containing large amounts of fissile
2351) is difficult. Fuel is usually enriched to between 2% and 4% of ?5U for
civil nuclear reactors in power stations. A much higher enrichment is
required for bombs and reactors for submarines (70% or 80%). There are
four methods of separating the isotopes of U: thermal diffusion, gaseous
diffusion, electromagnetic separation and using a gas centrifuge. Large
scale separation is now carried out using the different rates of diffusion of
gaseous *°UF, and UF, (see Chapter 31). The gas centrifuge method
is increasing in importance.

When 2**U absorbs neutrons it forms the heavier element Pu which is itself
fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel. Since a larger quantity of Pu may
be formed than the quantity of 7°5U that is consumed, the reactor is called
a fast breeder reactor.

Chemical properties

Uranium and the next three elements Np, Pu and Am show oxidation
states of (+HII), (+IV), (+V) and (+VI). These are similar to each other,
except that the most stable state drops from U(VI) to Np(V) to Pu(IV) to
Am(III). In the (+III) and (+IV) states the compounds are similar to
lanthanides. The ions formed in the oxidation states (+I), (+1V), (+)
and (+VI) are M?*, M**, MOS and MO3* respectively. Oxidation-
reduction reactions are rapid between M?* and M**, or MO? and MO3*,
as these only involve the transfer of an electron. Oxidation of M‘* to
MO3* is slow because it involves transfer of oxygen.

Uranium is a reactive metal. Finely divided metal reacts with boiling
water to give a mixture of UH; and UO>. The metal dissolves in acids, and
Teacts with hydrogen, oxygen, the halogens and many elements.

Hydrides
Uranium Teacts with hydrogen even at room temperature, though the
reaction is faster at 250°C, giving UH, as a black pyrophoric powder. The

hydride is very reactive, and is often more suitable than the metal for
making other compounds:
