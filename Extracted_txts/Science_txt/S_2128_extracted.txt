UFs

UF, and UCI, are octahedral but all the other halides are polymeric, and
have high coordination numbers. The halides are all hydrolysed by water.
The hexahalides dissolve in strong acid and give the UO3* ion. At higher
pH values this hydrolyses and polymerizes via hydroxyl bridges, giving:

UF, is obtained as colourless crystals, m.p. 64°C. It is a powerful fluori-
nating agent. and is rapidly hydrolysed by water. UFs tends to dispro-
portionate to UF, and UF,. The tetrahalides are the most stable.

NEPTUNIUM, PLUTONIUM AND AMERICIUM
Encept for *J3Pu, which is very important as a nuclear fuel and for bombs,

the other transuranium elements have few, uses outside research. *j4Np and
“uiPu can be extracted in kilogram quantities. and 73!Am and 733Am in
100g quantities from spent uranium fuel rods which have been used in a
nuclear reactor, Their separation 1s extremely difficult and hazardous. Not
only are they mixed with highly radioactive fission products, but the
material is also fissile. The critical mass for a sphere of Pu metal is about
1Okg but in solution less than I kg may be critical. Furthermore. Pu is
extremely toxic (a dose of 10 %g may be fatal and smaller doses are
carcmogenic), Am can be obtained from spent fuel rods. It is produced

by intense neutron irradiation of pure Pu at the Oak Ridge National
Luboratories in Tennessce. -
