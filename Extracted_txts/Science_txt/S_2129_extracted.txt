“THE ACTINIDES

 

 

‘The cepracessing of nuclear fuel rods 1s an mportant new technalagy
Plainly, reprocessing 1s necessary in breeder reactors to extract the new
elements produced so that they may be used as fuel Reprocessing also
essential 1 normal thermal reactors. This is because some of the fission
products that are produced absorb neutrons. Thus they will stop the chain
Teaction before all the ™*U or Pu has been used “There are over 30
different elements produced, including Sr, the second row transion
clements, 1, Xe, Cs, Ba, La and the lanthanides (Many of the ssotopes
formed are radioactive the best known are "Sr and "Ml ) There are large
amounts of U and Pu, and small amounts of the other transuranam
elements

Fuel rods removed from a reactor are immersed im water for 100 days
“Thus keeps them cool whale the highly radioactive ssotopes with short half
lives such 08 "5 (¢ya = 8 days) lose most of their actiaty

In the Purex process the fuel rods are dissolved in 7M HNO and
extracted with tributyl phosphate UO}* and Pu(+1V) are extracted in the
same way This leaves the other transuranium elements (mainly Np Am
and Cm) together with other fission products (mainly second row transition
elements and lanthanides) in the aqueous solution Careful reduction of
the UO#/Pu(+1V) solution with SOs, NHsOH or sron({I)sulphamate
Fe(NH;SOx)2 gives Pu(+Ill) This s easily separated from UO3* and U'*
by solvent extraction U 1s precipitated as uranyl nitrate and Pu as the
‘oxalate or luonde Eventually UO; and Pu, are recovered

Np. Pu and Am are reactive metals simular to U They dissolve n acids,
and react with hydrogen, oxygen the halogens and many elements The
oxidation states (+11) —> (V1) are present i solution as M'* Mt,
MO3 and MOF” The (+V0) state becomes increasingly oxidizing tn the
order U-+ Np» Pu Am AmO3* is as strongly oxidizing as KMnO4
‘The most stable states are Np(+V) Pu(+1V) and Am(+III) Very strong
‘oxidation of alkaline solutions of NpO?” and PuO3” with ozone or Hts
yields the (+VI1) state which has been isolated as LiNpO,) and LifPuOx)
‘The (FVM) state 16 strongly oxduing and when acidified it 15 rapidly
reduced to the (+VI) state and H.O 1s oxidized to Os

‘The most important oxides are the dioxides MO,, but the oxide systems
‘may be nonstoichiometric, and contain various solid solutions. The halides
are sonar to those of urannim in structure, propernes and preparation A
Uist of known compounds 1s given in Table 30 8

All sotopes of plutonium are important as nuclear fuels "Np 1s
converted by neutron irradiation to *"Pu for use as 8 power source 18
satelites ™¥Am ssa valuable laboratory source of u particles

 

 

‘THE LATER ACTINIDE ELEMENTS

Much less 1s known about the later elements curtum  einstemmum
fermium, mendelewum nobelum and lavwrencium This 1 due wt past 10
their hited availability and partly to these instatuity Table 304 shows
that only Cm isavailable m macroscopic quantines. and mnformation on the
‘others 1S largely from tracer studies
