Mitosis and cytokinesis. Mitosis (separation of the two genomes) occurs in four stages—prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—
and is followed by cytokinesis (division into two separate cells). In this depiction, the chromosomes of the African blood lily, Haemanthus
katharinae, are stained blue, and microtubules are stained red.
