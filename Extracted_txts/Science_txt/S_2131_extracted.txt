elements spontancous nuclear fission becomes the most important method
of decay Cf could become a valuable neutron source

FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE PERIODIC TABLE

The actimde series 1s complete at element 103 lawrencim Elements
104-109 have been reported recently and are d block elements. There are
currently two mayor groups working on producing, superheasy’ elements
‘one m Calforna USA and the other at Dubna ne ir Moscow 1a the USSR
By convention the workers who discover 1 new element have the rit 10
name it Element 104 (Ung) was first reported by Russian worker and
named kurchatovium Ku (after Igor Kurchatov) However thet work Was
repeated by American workers who obtained different results and named
the element rutherfordium RE (after Emest Rutherford) It appetrs to
resemble hafnium tn the d block ‘Tracer studies have heen earied out and
UngCls seems to be similar 10 HCl, Element 105 (Unp)_proviseon lly
named hakntum Ha (after Otto Haha) seems to resemble tantalum
UnpCls and UnpBr< have both been studied. Element 105 Unp has 1 hall
life of about 1 5 seconds end UnpBrs was observed from only 18. stoms
Both elements 104 and 10> have been made by bombarding actinides with
the accelerated nucter of light atoms For example element 10% was mide
{com californium by on bombardment with “N nucler The verv ort hal

numbers 1s not very bikely
‘The IUPAC proposed a system for nmin elements with Z > 100

1 The names are derived by using, roots for the three dats an the atom
number of the element and adding the ending, sum. ‘The rats forthe
numbers are

2 In certain cases the names are shortened for exampl. br um and tr
tum are shortened to bum and trum and enn nil s shortened to enn

3 The symbol for the element 1s made up from the first fetter ftom the
roots which make up the name The strange muxtuce of Lin and Greek
roots has been chosen to ensure that the symbols are all diferent

‘Though the names are wntten asa complete word an the examples below a
hyphen has been inserted between each pitt of the name to make thers
more understandable These hyphens should be omitted
