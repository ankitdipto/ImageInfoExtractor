the number of protons and the number of neutrons are magic numbers
‘Thus 2Pb 1s very stable wath 82 protons and 208 — 82 = 126 neatoas
“Thus suggests that nuchdes such as #7{Uuq_#¥{Uug and }Ubh might be

11s just possible that stable isotopes ofthe very heavy elements could be
‘made but that the preparative techniques have so far only succeeded
1 producing unstable isotopes Considerable efforts are being made
to produce elements 114 and 126 which seem to be favourable nuclear
arrangements The clements up to atomic number 105 have been made by
‘bombarding actinides with ight nucle such as He B C,Nand O fastead
‘of continuing to build up the elements gradually m small steps attempts
are being made to make elements beyond Z =: 105 by bombarding fry

‘The newly formed nucleus will decay emutting vartous particles. and the
energy of the accelerated particle 1s kept as low as possible to lessen the
chance of fission There are enormous practical difficulties In addition ts
extremely expensive to bud accelerators capable of imparting sufcent
