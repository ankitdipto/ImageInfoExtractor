PROBLEMS

1, Name the actinide elements in their correct order, and give their

chemical symbols.

. Which actinide isotopes are available (a) in tonnes, (b) in kilograms and
(c) in gram quantities?
- Compare and contrast the Pyramid of oxidation states found in the first

row of the transition elements with the oxidation states found in
lanthanides and in the actinides,

» What are the main sources of Th and U? How are the metals obtained?

5. Describe the methods which have been used to separate the isotopes of

uranium. Explain the difficulties.
