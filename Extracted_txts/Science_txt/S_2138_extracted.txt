minimize the repulsne force. the shape of the nucleus 1s deformed, just
like the elongation of a large liquid drop

‘This model was suggested by the Danish physicist Niels Bohe to explain
why heavy nuclei undergo nuclear fission Uranium (clement number 92)
of mass number 235, 3$U, 1850 deformed that the addition ofa tle extra
energy. € g absorption of a neutron, causes the nucleus to break ito two
‘smaller nucles This is called nuclear fission, and when st occurs a large
amount of energy 1s released. Nucles with mass numbers larger than that of
uranium are so deformed that they undergo spontaneous fission Ths
‘means that the nucler disintegrate (break up on their own) without any
‘external peturbation

‘The density of all nuclei except the very lightest s almost constant Thus
the volume of the nucleus 1s directly provortional to the number of
nucleons present Nuclet with differing numbers of nucleons are regarded
as different sizes of drop The range of nuclear attractive forces 1s very
small (2fm-3fm) ‘The nucleons can move inside the nucleus rather like
the particles in a hquid

Shell model

In the electron cloud surrounding an atom we can distinguish different
electronic energy levels. The electrons are arranged in diferent shell and
orbstals which may be desenibed by four quantum numbers. The nocleons
ate thought to be arranged in a definte way m the nucleus Thus the
nucleons are arranged in shells, corresponding to diferent energy levels
‘When the nucleons occupy the lowest energy levels this corresponds 10
the ground state Under different conditions the nucleons may octopy
different (higher or excited) energy levels Usually the population ofthese
hugher nuclear energy levels s'50 short-lived that st cannot be observed
‘Thus the properties of the nucleus depend only on the number of neutrons
and protons, and not on the energy levels they occupy

Ina few cases the excited nuclear states have a measurable life, and
‘when this occurs nuclear ssomers can exist Nuclear isomers are simply
nucle with the same number of neutrons and protons, hut whose enerEles
differ It follows that the masses of the somers differ by @ very small
amount corresponding to the difference in energy

Many nuclet are unstable even when they correspond to the ground
state Unstable nucler decompose by emitting various particles and electo-
magnetic radiation, and this 1s called radioactive decay Over 1500 unstable
rnuclet are known “If no radioactive decomposition can be detected the
nucleus ss said to be stable

‘The shell structure 1s supported by a periodicity in nuclear properties
Certain combinations of neutrons and protons are particulary stable
1 Elements of even atomic number are more stable and more abundant

than neighbouring elements of odd atomic number Ths 1s known 35
