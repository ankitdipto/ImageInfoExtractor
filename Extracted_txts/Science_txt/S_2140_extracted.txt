(p08) "THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS, 7

‘The attractive force does not depend on the charge as the same attractive
force binds protons to protons protons {0 neutrons and neutrons to
neutrons

“Tivo atoms may be held together by a sharing of electrons because the
exchange forces result in a covalent bond By analogy two nuclear
pparucles may be held together by sharing a particle The partle
‘exchanged 15 called a x meson Mesons may have a positive charge n* a
negative charge x or no charge x Exchange of n™ and n° mesons
accounts for the binding energy between neutrons and protons The
transfer of a charge converts a neutron to a proton or vice versa The
resultant attractive forces are indicated by dotted lines in the examples

‘The attractive forces between p=n nn and p-p are probably all simi
ansteength The different types of mesons have sinlar masses The mass af
an? meson 1s 264 tumes that of an electron and the masses ofboth x* and
_ mesons are 273 times that of an electron All mesons are very unstable
outside the nucleus There ate many other less common elementary
particles an the nucleus ‘This topic is really within the field of partite
Physics and is beyond the scope of this book The aumber of charged
particles in @ nucleus remains eonstant However the continual transfer of
‘mesons means that the parices representing neutrons and protons ate
constantly changing The transformation of neutrons unto protons and vice
versa ae first order reactions The rates of the reactions depend on the
relative numbers of neutrons and protons present In a stable nuceut
these two changes are in equikbrium

 

 

STABILITY AND THE RATIO OF NEUTRONS TO PROTONS

‘The stabiity of a nucleus depends on the number of protons and neutrons
present For elements of low atomic number (up 10 Z = 20 1 Ca) the
most stable nucle exist when the nucleus contains an equal tumber of
protons P and neutrons N Thus means that the ratio N/P = 4. Elements
‘with higher atomic numbers are more stable if they have a sight excess of
neutrons as this increases the attractive force and also reduces repulsion
between protons Thus the ratio N/P increases progressively up to about
