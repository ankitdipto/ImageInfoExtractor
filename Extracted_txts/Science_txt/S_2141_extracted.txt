1.6 at Z = 92 (uranium). In elements with still higher atomic numbers, the
nuclei have become so large they undergo spontaneous fission. These
trends are shown in the graphs of neutron number N against proton
number P, and N/P ratio against proton number for the stable nuclei
(Figure 31.1).

 

Figure 31.1 Neutron to proton ratio.

MODES OF DECAY

Stable nuclei lie near to these curves. Nuclei with N/P ratios appreciably
higher or lower than the stable ratio are radioactive. When they decay they
form nuclei closer to the line of maximum stability.

If the N/P ratio is high, the isotope lies above the curve. Such a nucleus
will decay in such a way that it reduces the N/P ratio and forms a stable
arrangement. The ratio can be reduced in two ways.

Beta emission

Electrons or B radiation may be emitted from the nucleus when a neutron
is converted into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. This reduces the
NIP ratio. The neutrino v is a strange particle. It has zero mass and zero
charge, and is postulated to balance the spins. A neutrino is emitted in

almost all nuclear transformations. The change of a neutron into a proton
may be written:

in ip+ fe +v
The mass ‘Aumbers are shown at the top and must be balanced on both
sides of this equation. The nuclear charges are shown at the bottom. These
too must be balanced on both sides of the equation. The loss of an electron

from the nucleus in this way decreases the N/P ratio. If an isotope is not far
from the stable N/P line one B decay process may be sufficient:

RC HN + ety

BAI — BSI + Ye + v
tsotapes further from the stable line may undergo a series of B decays. The
ultant nuclei become progressively more stable and have a longer half

life period, until eventually a stable isotope is formed.
