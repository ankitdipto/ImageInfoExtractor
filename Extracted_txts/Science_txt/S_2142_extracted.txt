{In decay the mass number remains unchanged. but the nuclear charge
sncreases by one unit Thus when B decay occuts the element moves one
place to the nght in the periodic table

Neutron emission

‘An obvious way to decrease the N/P ratio would seem 10 be to emit 2

neutron from the nucleus Thus form of decay is rare and only takes place

‘wath highly energeue nucler Tins 2s because the binding energy of the

‘neutron in the nucleus 1s high (about 8MeV) One of the few examples

involves '3Kr which can decay either by neutron emission or i decay
Ukr —— kr + bn

If the N/P ratio 1s too low, the ssotope lies below the curve There are
three possible modes of decay

Positron emission

Positrons or f+ radiation (posiuve clectrons) result from the trans
formation of a proton to a neutron The positron 1s ejected from the
nucleus together with an anti neutrino 9

‘The ant neuinno is postulated to balance the spins. When the positron
‘ejected from the aucleus it very quickly collides with an electron in the
surroundings The two particles anniiuate each other and their energy i
released as two y ray photons These photons are released 1n opposte
rections (180° apart), so there 1s no resultant near or angslar
momentum Thus each photon has exactly half ofthe anmulaton enerey
of 1022Mev, 1e each photon has an energy of 0 S11Mev This energy
came onginally from the parent nucleus It follows that the mass of the
parent nucleus 1s greater than the mass of the daughter nucleus. Ths
process increases the NIP ratio Gamma radiation usually ances another
way, as descnbed later Some examples of positron emission a
