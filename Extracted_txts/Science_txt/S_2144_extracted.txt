of radioactive nucles to fall to half the onginal number, that 1s to reach
n= Jno Since there s no way of counting the number of radioactive mit
present, we cannot calculate Ain this way However, we can substitute the
activity at ume = 0 (Ao) and the activity at time = ¢(A) for the number of
atoms The activity can be measured and 1s the number of counts recorded

Nuclear energies are of the order of 10°kJmol~! of nucleons The
energes involved in chemical reactions are about 10-107 kI mol” Clearly
transmutation of one element to another by chemical means ss mpossble,
because of the exceedingly high muclear energy For the same reasom 2

‘The radioactnaty of a sample 1s traditionally measured in cunes (Ci)
Originally a curse was taken asthe amount of radioacuve disntegratio® 19
got 7GRa Iss more preesly defined as the amount of aradiosol°FE
which gives 37 x 30! dwintegrations per second Thus one cune of
diferent radiorsotopes contains a wadely diferent number of atoms THE
SI unit of aeuwnty 1s the becquerel (Bq), and is defined asthe amount Of
