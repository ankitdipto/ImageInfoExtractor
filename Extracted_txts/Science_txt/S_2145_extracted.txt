electrons. The difference is called the mass defect. The mass defect is
related to the binding energy holding the neutrons and protons together in
the nucleus. A stable nucleus must have less energy than its constituent
particles or it would not form. a ;

Energy and mass are related by the Einstein equation AE = Ame?
were AE is the energy liberated, Am the loss in mass (the mass defect)
and c the velocity of light (2.998 x 10°ms~'). The mass defect can be
calculated, and converted to the binding energy in the nucleus. The larger
the mass defect, the larger the binding energy, and therefore the more
stable the nucleus.

Mass of {p = 1.007277 a.m.u., Mass of jn = 1.008665 a.m.u.
(931 is the conversion factor from atomic mass units a.m.u. to MeV).

It is quite easy to calculate whether a nucleus is stable against decay. Some
possible decay processes are given below.

3He — |n + 3He SLi dn + 3Li
gHe > jn + $n +3He SLi jp + 3He
3He = |p + 7H SLi—> $He + 37H

In each of the above reactions the mass of the parent is less than the
combined mass of the suggested products. Thus none of the above decay
Processes occur.

The total binding energy of the nucleus increases with the number of
nucleons present. To compare the stability of nuclei of different elements
we calculate the average binding energy per nucleon:

total binding energy

binding energy per nucleon =
number of nucleons

The graph of binding energy per nucleon against atomic number, for the
different elements, shows that nucleons are held together with increasing
force up to a mass number of about 65. The binding energy for each
additional nucleon decreases as the nuclei get larger (Figure 31.2). For
Most nuclei the average binding energy per nucleon is about 8MeV.

Consequently 8MeV of energy is needed to remove either a proton or a
neutron from the nucleus.
