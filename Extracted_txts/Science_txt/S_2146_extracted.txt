Figure 31 2 Binding energy per nucleon

forces are unable to hold the nucleons together Thus part of the nucleus
breaks off An a particle 1s emutted from the nucleus Ana particle 2
helm nucleus $He This 1s a particularly stable muctear fragment. as all
the nucleons are an the lowest possible energy level and both the number
‘of neutrons and the number of protons are magic numbets At the same
time energy 18 liberated In the decay of “SU. 42MeV of energy 1s
released because the mean binding energy per nucleon of the two daughter
nucler?85Th and $He 1s greater than for the parent nucleus =U This isan
‘enormous amount of energy (1 MeV = 96 48 x 10°KI mol™!)

SU — FMTh + fHe + energy
Ako — Spb + tHe + eneray

‘Alpha particles have no electron cloud, and have a charge of +2 Once
eutted, an e particle quickly takes up two electrons from any atom in the
‘erty, thas becomang a neutral He atom ‘The formation of He can be
detected when a decay occurs

‘The mass of the patent nucleus must provide both the mass of the
daughter nucleus and that of the « particle, plus the rial amount of mass
‘which is converted into energy” Tt ean be calculated from the mass ofthe
nucleus whether a decay rn any element 1s energetically posible Natural
«activity is only possible among elements with mass numbers greater that
209, as only these elements have the required energy Conversely 209s the
largest number of nucleons which will it nto a stable nucteus

Tt ejection of one o particle does not completely stabilize the nvcleus
then further a paticles may be emitted However, « decay rases the NIP
ratio 50 11s often followed by § emission

‘Nuclet of mass umber above 230 may undergo spontaneous fission
forming two lighter nucle: Thus two elements of lower atone number are
