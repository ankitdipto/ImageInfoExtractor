‘THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS

 

un No

‘This reaction was first carried out by E Rutherford in 1919 and ths was
the first mduced nuclear transformation (He was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Chemistry in 1908 ) The second example was everied out in 1932 by F
Johiot and Irene Joliot Curie ands an (w n) reaction (They were awarded
the Nobel Prize for Chernstry 1n 1935 )
Ras Ap

Ina similar way the third example 1s  (p 1) reaction In the last example
the energy ts emuted as rays and so this.s an (n 7) reaction The nucle
formed in this way may be stable or may subsequently decay The
‘ransuranic elements are all obtained by bombarding a heavy nucleus with
ta particles stripped carbon or the nucte of other ight atoms to produce
an even heavier nucleus

NUCLEAR FISSION

Very heavy mucter have a lower binding energy per nucleon than nucle
‘with an intermediate mass Thus nucle of intermediate mass are more
stable than hevwy nuclet When 2 slow neutron enters 2 nucleus of
fissionable atom such as uranium (which 1s alreudy distorted) the extra
energy may cause the nucleus 0 spt ito two fragments and spon
taneously emit two OF more neutrons This is called fission The fission
process results inthe release of large amounts of energy (about 8 x 10°KI
mol") In the case of 4*U several uferent primary fission products are
formed depending on exactly how the nucleus splits up Three of the more
common reactions are

1gBa + Kr + 2(4n)
aU + In GIME + SY + 3(in)
Nites + §Rb + 4(én)
‘Note that the daughter nucle formed fall nto wo classes The heawer
group have masses from 130 to 160 and the lighter group have masses from
80 t0 110 Its rare for the two daughter nucle of about the same mass 9
‘be formed (Figure 31 3)

‘The total mass of the fission products 1s some Q 22 mass units less than
the mass of the uranium atom and neutron This corresponds 1 an enetsy
release of over 200MeV This 1s more than twelve times the enetsy
Iiberated in a normal nuclear reaction The complete fission of 1b
(0 45kg) of uranium releases as much energy as the explosion of $000
tonnes of TNT

‘The nucle formed as primary fission products have a high neutron to
proton ratio and decav By Bemussion to lower this ratio Usually several
Such steps are required before a stable nucleus obtained Thus each of
the primary decay products s sssocrvted with a deeay chain for example
