About 90 decay chains have been identified from the fission of 735U, giving
a total of several hundred different nuclides.

Chain reaction

One fission reaction can cause another. The neutron produced by a fission
will either:

1. Cause another nuclear fission reaction.
2. Be lost from the fissionable material
3. Be used in a non-fission reaction.

When neutrons produced in fission reactions initiate new fissions, this is
called a chain reaction. There are two major applications of chain reactions
~ the atomic bomb (A-bomb) and nuclear powered electricity generating
stations,

If more than one neutron per fission causes another fission we have a
branched chain reaction, and a rapidly increasing release of energy takes
Place. This is what happens in the atomic bomb. in a nuclear reactor.
control rods are used to absorb some of the neutrons, so that on average
only one neutron Per fission causes another fission. A chain reaction of this

kind is self-perpetuating. The energy is released at a slow enough rate to be
used,
