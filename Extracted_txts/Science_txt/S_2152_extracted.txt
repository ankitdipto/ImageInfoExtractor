“THE ATOWEC NUCLEUS

 

 

Catical mass

‘There isa minimum amount of fsstonable material that can produce a self
sustasning chain reaction This s called the critical mass. The critieal mass
depends on several factors

1 The pumty of the sample

2. The density of the material

3. Its geometne shape and us surroundings

‘These all affect the neutron propagation ratio If the sample 1s ampure
many neutrons will be lost through colliding with non fissile atoms. The
more dense the material the greater the chance that neutrons wall collide
with another nucleus The shape of the sample 15 also important sutce
newtrons are more hkely to escape from a fong thin strip of matenal than
from a sphere

‘THE STORY BEHIND PRODUCTION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB

Nuclear fission of heavy nucles was frst achieved sn Berhn in December
1939 and in 1944 Otto Hahn received the Nobel Prize for Chemstry for
this work The first German reactor (sub critical Pile B Ill) was sor
prsingly housed in the Virus House at the Kaiser Wilhelm insttote for
Biology at Dahlem At that time nuclear reactors were called atom ples
and the German reactor consisted of alternate layers of uranium metal and
paraffin wax in an aluminium sphere which was immersed in water
‘Though the pile contained $51kg of uranium it was sub-ertical Ths
means that Jess than one neutron produced from etch fission caused
another fission Thus a neutron source was placed 1m a chimney at the
centre ofthe sphere to heep the pile cunning,

‘Two years later Enrico Fermi made a pile go critical (self supporting) at
the Unwersity of Chicago USA (Fermi was an Italian and was awarded
the Nobel Pre for Physcs in (938 for produang new radioachse
elements by neutron irradiation He fled from World War Il and Fast
aly 1 the USA ) The Chicago pile consisted of a huge block of graphite
surrounded by several feet of high density concrete. Horrzontal channels 0
the graphite were used to mnsert enough slugs of uranium 10 produce the
chan reaction Atr was blown through to cool the pile and to remove the
energy produced One thousand kilowatts of heat were extracted. The Pe
sas housed in the squash courts! Larger pales were then built at Cinton
Tennessee and Hanford: Washington

A secret rminaty base was bull at Oak Ridge in Tennessee as part ofthe

Manhattan Projecto conduct research into making an atomic bomb
Navually occurring U consists largely of two wotapes 99 3% of SU
‘which i$ non fisstle- and 0 7% of "SU which 1s fissile

 

 

Separation of sotopes

Enormous efforts were made to separate the 1sotopes to obtain suffcrent
fissile ™U to make a bomb Four methods were used
