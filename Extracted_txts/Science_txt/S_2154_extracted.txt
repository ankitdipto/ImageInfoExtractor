"THE ATOMIENUCLEUS 7

 

“There were immense dificulties mn obtaining a sufficient quantity of °U to
make a bomb The entical mass depends on the purty. and the bomb had
to be light enough to carry in an aeroplane

Meanwhile a second fissile element plutontum Pu was discovered
Glenn Seaborg at the University of California (Berkeley) in 1940 Pus
produced by srradiating the relatwely plentiful 7U with neutrons m 9
fuclear reactor

"AU + Jn RU Fp 2 Pu
ieBsaa Roam

All sotopes of Pu are fissile, and Pu became important as a nuclear fuel
Work on plutontum was marnly carned out at Hanford

Bomb making

‘A third site at Los Alamos (New Mexico) concentrated mainly on the
technical problems of how to make bombs ‘The problems are how to
transport sub-critical masses of Pu or U in an aeroplane. and combine them
to give a critical mass when over the target Then the material must be
contained for 2 long enough time for the nuclear reaction 10 occur

In the case of the Pu bomb an implosion device was used Several sub
ential masses of "Pu were placed round the edges of a sphere and sur
rounded by high exploswes. The conventional explosives were detonated
‘The implosion blew the sub-eraical masses of Punto the centre where they
formed a entical mass. The force of the explosion held the Pu together for
Jong enough for a nuclear explosion to oscur The first atomic bomb used
‘this principle and was tested on a 100 foot-high tower at Trinity in New
Mexico at 529.2 m (just before sunrise) on 16 July 1945 It worked! Fermi
estimated that the temperature.produced was four times that at the centre
of the sun, and a pressure of over 100 billion atmospheres was produced
‘The radioactwity emitted was a million times greater than from the worlds
total radium supply Parts for another similar atomic bomb were shipped to
the Far East to be assembled and dropped on Japan,

Meanwhile sufficient *“U to make a bomb had laboriously been
collected The most practical way to make a bomb was to use « gun barrel
and shoot 4 sub entical mass of ?U down the barrel into another sub-
critical mass at the end of the barrel This had not been tested, since up till
then there had not been enough “U for a test Parts to assemble ths
bomb were shipped to the Far East

‘The Pu bomb was called ‘Fat Man‘. and was 10 feet 8 ches long and 60
inches n dhameter. and weighed 10800Ib The bomb was so wade thatthe
doors on the bomb bay of the aeroplane had to be altered to get the bomb
1m and to allow it to be dropped The U bomb was called ‘Little Boy’ and
‘was 10 feet long, but only 28 mches in diameter, and weighed 89001D The
smaller diameter allowed «to ft mn the aeroplane, and made s possible 0
use the U bomb first

“The U bomb Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 195
