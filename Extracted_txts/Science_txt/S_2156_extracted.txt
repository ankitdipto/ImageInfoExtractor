Fost
Early reactors used uranium metal Most thermal reactors now use UO: a8
this has a higher melung point and 1s less chemacally reacuve Natural U
rmay be used as fuel (99 3% 2U and 0 7% **U) However, 1 usual 10
ennch the fuel to between 2% and 3% 7U to allow for some neutrons
being absorbed by the metal case cladding the fuel rods, of by the
moderator Enriching U reduces the eniteal mass, and hence the size of the
reactor However, st 4s very expensive Enrichment beyond 3% 1s only
tarned out for mittary purposes to make bombs or for special sinal igh
temperature reactors for submarines “The latter use UC, enriched to over
90% as fuel

Fast (breeder) reactors use plutonium oxide as fuel They have 10
‘moderator, so the fast neutrons produced can convert non-fissile ™™U sno
fissile Pu by the reactions

More Pu 1s produced than 1s used hence the name “breeder reactet"
Sometimes thonum (which 18 non fissile) 1s incorporated into the fuel

‘TYPES OF REACTOR IN USE
Gas cooled thermal reactors (all use graphite as moderator)

Magnox reactors

‘These use U metal rods as fuel, enclosed n'a Mg/Al (magnox) casing, he
fuel s natural. v€ not enriched, and CO. gas s used 25 the coolant Most
of the early reactors in the UK are of this type These are now nearing thE
end of their hfe

Advanced gas cooled reactors (AGR)
‘These use UO; pellets enriched 10 2% as fuel with COs as the coolart

Hugh temperature reactor (HTR)

“These are used for minary purposes suchas submarines The feels UC2
Which i enriched 10 over 20's thus allowing the reactor wo be small TE
coolant 1s He and the control cod are made of C4
