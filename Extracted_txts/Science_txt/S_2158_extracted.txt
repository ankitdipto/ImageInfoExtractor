elements combine to form heavier elements The binding energy per
faucleon for light elements 1s less than that for elements of intermediate
mass. Thus the fusion of two light nuclei results in a more stable nuckets,
and a large amount of energy 1 hberated Both fusion and fission are
methods of releasing large amounts of energy In fusion, light atoms are
combined to give heavier clements, whist in fission heavy radwoachive
atoms are split nto atoms of mtermediate mass

‘The simplest nuclear fusion reaction involves the asotopes of hydrogen
