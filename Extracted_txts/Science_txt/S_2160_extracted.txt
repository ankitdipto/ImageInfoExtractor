Another interesting technique which may show promise ts to replace an
electron in a Df molecule by a negatively charged muon which weighs 207
tumes as much as an electron This should reduce the D=D spacing by @
factor of 200 which should make fusion easier

‘Nuclear fasion holds the promuse of being an important future source of
energy World energy consumption 1s high and fuel resources are fine
and ltmuted Oil and natural gas reserves may well be exhausted in 50
years Coal may last rather longer perhaps 200 years Uranium resouries
are finite, and the use of nuclear powered clectneity generating statis
will only delay an eventual energy shortfall All these fuels pose envire®
mental problems Fossil fuels (oil gas and coal) contribute to the
Greenhouse Effect and acid rain A long term energy replacement needs 0

1. The fuel for fuston (hydrogen) 1s almost infintely avastable

2 The muclear processes sn fusion are inherently safer than those of
fission

3. Fusion promises to have minimal pollution problems

than with fission
