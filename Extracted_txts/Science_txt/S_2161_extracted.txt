ino Ipt fe +¥

During the big bang and the fireball which followed, temperatures of
10°210°K occurred, and in the first hour or so a number of nuclear
reactions occurred:

1H + én > 7H

?H ++ 1H— 3He

3He + jn > $He

3He + jn > 3He
The isotope $He has a half life of only 2 x 10~2!s, so building progressively
heavier nuclei by the sequential addition of neutrons or protons stopped at
this point. Once the temperature had fallen all of these reactions stopped.
Thus most of the universe was in the form of H, with a small amount of He,
and from this matter the galaxies of stars condensed.

Regardless of the origin of the universe, it is generally accepted that
heavier elements may be produced by reactions in the stars. H still
accounts for 88.6% and He for about 11.3% of all the atoms in the
universe. Together these constitute 99.9% of the atoms, and over 99% of
the mass of the universe.

The first process in the synthesis of heavier nuclei in stars is hydrogen
burning. Stars are extremely dense (10° gcm~) and there is an enormously
large gravitational force. Some of this force is converted into heat and the
temperature rises to about 10” K. It has been mentioned previously (under
‘Nuclear fusion’) that this temperature is sufficient to overcome the
repulsion between two positively charged H nuclei, and so these nuclei can
undergo nuclear fusion, forming deuterium.

The process is exothermic. A small amount of mass is lost and energy is
evolved. ‘Thus more stable nuclei are formed. The process is also slow. The
sun Is estimated to be 5 billion years old, but still has about 90% of the
hydrogen left.
