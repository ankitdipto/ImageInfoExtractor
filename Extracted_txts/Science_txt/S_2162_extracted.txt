‘These reactions use up the He 1m the core and replace 1t with C, O and Ne
‘When most of the H and He have been used, small stars contract and
become hotter and are called whe dwarfs

However, in larger stars (14 times the mass or the sun or greater)

contraction gives even higher temperatures than before (6 X 10"K) and a
carbon-mtrogen cycle occurs involving the reaction of these elements
with hydrogen, provded some "IC 1s available as catalyst
