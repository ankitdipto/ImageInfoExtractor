$Ca + $He > $Ti + y

These fusion reactions are exothermic up to 36Fe, and Figure 31.2 shows
that the binding energy per nucleon increases from H up to Fe, and then
decreases with the heavier elements.

The discussion so far explains why H and He make up so much of the,
universe. The most abundant and stable nuclei up to atomic number 20
have a 1:1 ratio of neutrons to protons, e.g. He, '3N, 180, 7$Mg and $8Ca.
Most of these (except N) have an éven number of neutrons and an even
number of protons (even atomic number) A few light isotopes are common
and abundant but do not have a 1:1 N/P ratio, e.g. '8F, 7}]Na and ZAl.
These elements have an odd atomic number and hence an odd number of
protons, but they have an even number of neutrons. These odd—even
nuclei are more stable than the corresponding odd—odd nucleus which has
a1:1N/P ratio. The elements Li, Be and B are of very low abundance
compared with their neighbours. It is surprising that they occur at all since
the small amounts produced by H and He burning are converted into
heavier elements. The small amounts that are found are probably
produced by spallation reactions where cosmic rays collide with C, N and O
nuclei and cause them to break into lighter nuclei. This is sometimes called
the x-process. A number of elements such as 12C, '$O and 79Ne are more
abundant than their neighbours, and they differ by a $He. nucleus, which
reflects their mode of formation by fusing with helium. The nucleus 36Fe is
particularly abundant because it has the largest binding energy per
nucleon. It is thus the most stable nucleus and is formed by fusion. The
abundances of the elements preceding Fe (Sc, Ti, V and Cr) are also higher
than expected, and this is probably due to spallation reactions where high
speed cosmic rays collide with Fe, producing Sc, Ti, V or Cr as well as
some Li, Be and B.

Nuclei-heavier than 38Fe are endothermic, and can only be produced by
supplying energy. Thus it becomes increasingly difficult to make these
elements by fusion. The heavier elements are synthesized by neutron
capture reactions in stars. There are two main processes by which this may
occur, called the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid
neutron capture).

In the slow neutron capture process neutrons are added one by one to
the nucleus. The addition of a neutron increases the N/P ratio, and
eventually the addition of a neutron makes the nucleus unstable. Because
of the long time scale the nucleus has time to decay, and the unfavour-
able N/P ratio is corrected by B decay. Then the process is repeated and
another neutron is added. -
