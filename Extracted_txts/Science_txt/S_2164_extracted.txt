‘The neutrons are produced in red grants and an second generation stars by
the normal processes 1n the star, such as

NC + tHe — 'f0 + Ja
or NO + NO HS + in

“The slow addition of neutrons can produce mucler up 10 “#XB1 There are
much higher than expected abundances of elements round about mass
numbers 90, 138 and 208, and the sotopes SY and 222r, ‘Ba and "Ce,
and *&{Pb and 3B1 occur n relatively high abundance In the discussion on
the number of neutcons and protons inthe nucleus atthe begining ofthis
‘chapter it was noted that nucle with 2.8, 20, 28 $0, 82 oF 126 neutrons or
protons are particulary stable, and that these numbers are termed ‘magic
rhumbers’ The three clusters of elements wath high abundances are close 10
the neutron magic numbers 50, 82 and 126 This means that they have
unusually Tow neutron absorption cross-sections 0 they do not capture
neutrons very reasly and hence therrconcentration buildsup Thes process
produces the lighter or proton-rich tsotopes of an element

A diferent source of neutrons occurs yust prior 10 and during a super
nova period im star In this, bg stars become extremely hot (8 x 10°K),
and nucle inthe core break down into neutrons protons and a particles
‘which undergo a vartety of reactions The core contracts and eventually
amplodes, resulting in an explosion of the outer shell which scaters
matenal out into space In the r-process. many neutrons ate added in 2
penod of a few seconds before f decay eventually takes place

Fe + 13({n) + Se
YFe + Co +
“The very heavy elements ae produced in this way by adding many
ncutrons at once, and taces of §2Cf are present n stars and ths isotope s
also formed during nuclear explosions In a similar way the elements wEs
einsteimum and anim fermium were formed during the hydrogen bomb
explosions The eprocess ives neutton rch wotopes. Te also possible
that neutron-nich wsotopes of several fighter wotopes, e g HS MICs and
42Ca, may he formed by the process Its possible that proton capture
m asupernovacna very shor tne sale Ts ee
process and possible that a range of sotopes from USe "43Sn "Sn
cand '{3Sn_up to ‘Hg are formed in this wav
‘The short half life periods of ll the isotopes ot technetium and
‘romethium explams why they are absent on earth
