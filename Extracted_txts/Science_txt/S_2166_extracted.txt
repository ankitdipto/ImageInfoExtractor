NHy_ Since NHJCI ionizes mto NH and CI", ths provides evdente
for the ronization of liquid NHy

2NH, = Ni + NHZ

‘Simularly the lack of exchange between '{C in a solution contarung
labelled CN and the complex [Fe(CN).)™~ shows that the CN groups it
the complex are not labile Proof thatthe two S atoms in the thoselphate
10m $;0$7 are nat edentical ean be obtained by heating labelled #5 wath an
aqueous solution of sodium sulphute to form the thiosulphate

SO} + 1S — 1fs803-

If the thiosulphate so formed 1s decomposed by treatment with acd, all the
radioactivity returns to the sulphur, and none to the SOs formed
2H* + HSSO}- + SO; + HS + 1,0

‘The ssotope $Co emits both f and y radiation It 1s used for ¥
radiography to detect cracks and flaws m metal parts such as pipes, aurerlt
parts and welded yornts, for example in the pressure vessels for nucleat
reactors It1s also used fo irradiate malignant tumaurs mn the body as oft
method of cancer therapy

‘The nuchde "HI ss used to locate bramn tumours and also inthe diagnosis
and treatment of disorders of the thyroid gland In the case of brait
‘tumours, the isotope 1s incorporated into a dye and injected into the
patent “It as preferennally absorbed by the cancerous cells, and the
Position of the tumour can be found by scanning the skull For thyretd
‘cases the patient consumes a low dose of this isotope as Nal The
radioactive I concentrates in the thyroid gland and can be measured by
‘counting the y actraty

Labelied NaCI solution which contains the sotope #{Na is injected inf
the veins to discover the location and extent of blood elots and othe?

Mass of neutron §n = 1 008665 amu

Mass of electcon -fe = 0 00054859 amu

‘Mass of helium atom $He = 4 00260 amu

Mass of helium nucleus (a particle $He) = 4.00150 amu

MeV = million electron volts (1 MeV = 9 648 x 107kJ mol"!)
Lamu = 931 4812 MeV = 8982 x 10!%3 mot"
