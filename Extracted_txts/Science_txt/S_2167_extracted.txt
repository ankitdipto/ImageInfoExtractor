PROBLEMS

1, What is the nature of the binding forces in atomic nuclei? How does
the average binding energy per nucleon vary with the atomic number
of the element?

2. Define the following terias: atomic number, mass number, isotope, a
decay, B decay, y radiation, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion.

3. In What way is the mode of decay of a particular nucleus related to (a)
the ratio of neutrons and protons, and (b) the size?

- Explain the terms mass number, isotopic mass and nuclear binding
energy used in the description of an isotope.

. Draw a diagram to illustrate how the binding energy per nucleon varies
with the mass number. Comment on the shape of the curve.
