. (a) What is the difference between a chain reaction and a branched

chain reaction.
(b) What is a moderator? Give examples.
(c) Explain what the critical mass of a fissile material is, and why does

the critical mass vary? |
Compare the processes of nuclear fission and fusion as sources of
energy.
Calculate the energy released in MeV per fusion in the following
process:

7D +1Hâ€”> 7H

given that the atomic masses are: 7D 2.01410 amu, 'H 1.007825 amu,
7He 3.01603 amu. (Answer: 5.5 MeV per fusion. )
Explain how nuclei heavier than uranium can be prepared.
