Spectra

 

 

Electrome spectra from transition metal 1ons and complexes are observed
1m the visible and UV regions Absorption spectra show the particulét
wavelengths of light absorbed, that 1s the particular amount of energy
required to promote an electron from one energy level to a higher level
‘whilst emission spectra show the energy emitted when the electron falls,
back from the excited level to a lower level Transitions involving the
‘outer shell of electrons are generally observed in the wavenumber regiot
100000cm™! to 10000em™', ut most spectra are measured in the
0000-10 000em"* region (200-1000nm) ‘The smerpretation of spectit
provides a most useful tool for the description and understanding of the
energy levels present
