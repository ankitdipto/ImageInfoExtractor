 

f ENERGY LEVELS IN AN ATOM

The build-up of electrons in the elements follows three simple rules:

. Electrons normally occupy the orbitals of lowest energy.

. Hund’s rule: when several orbitals have the same energy, electrons are
not paired if this can be avoided. Thus in the ground state, an atom will
contain the maximum number of unpaired electron spins.

3. The Pauli exclusion principle: no two electrons in one atom can have all

four quantum numbers the same.

This can be illustrated using boxes for orbitals, and arrows for electrons
(Figure 32.1). The two electrons in the Is orbital for He have opposite
spins; thus ¢ denotes m, = +4 and | denotes m, = —4. The filling of the
Is and 2s energy levels is straightforward.

At boron, an electron occupies a 2p orbital. The three 2p orbitals have
identical values of n = 2, and / = 1, but have different values of m (+1, 0
