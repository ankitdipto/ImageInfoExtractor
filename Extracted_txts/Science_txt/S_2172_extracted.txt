In the case of carbon, two electrons occupy the 2p level, and there ate
15 possible electronic arrangements (Figure 32 2) These can be divided
into three main groups of different energy ~ called three energy stat®S

‘Thus even though the p orbitals are degenerate and have the same energ¥

the electrons present in them interact with each other and result in the
formation of «ground state (lowest energy) and one or more excited stales
for the atom or 1on In addition to the electrostatic repulsion betwee?
electrons, they influence each other (1) by the teraction or coupling of
the magnetic fields produced by their spins. and (2) by coupling of the
fields produced by the orbital motion of the electrons (orbital angulat
momentum) When several electrons occupy a subshell the energy sales
