shown as an arrow of unit length. The ways in which the / values for two p
electrons may interact with each other are shown diagrammatically using
vector diagrams (Figure 32.3). Because angular momentum is quantized,
the only permissible arrangements are those where the resultant is a whole
number of quanta. Thus three possible states of spectroscopic terms D, P
and S arise. For the P state, the vectors / must be at an angle to each other
such that the resultant is a whole number of quanta and in this case L = 1.

p configuration

‘The coupling of the / values of three p electrons by vectorial addition can
be considered in an analogous way, and for simplicity this is considered as
the interaction of a third p electron on the states obtained for the p? case
(Figure 32.4). The result of coupling the orbital angular momenta is the
production of one F state, two D states, three P states and oné S state.

The cou

for
