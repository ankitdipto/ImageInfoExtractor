Coupling of spin angular momenta

For a single electcon, the spin quantum number m, has a vatue of +4at ~}
If two oF more electrons are present in a subshell, che magnet fields
produced interact wath each other, that ‘couple’, giving a resultant 8
guantum number S (Its unfortunate that the symbol 51s used both for
the resultant spin quantum number, and fr the spectroscopic state Whe
L= 0, but in practice thus does not normally cause confusion }

 

Ford® case

By using arrows to depict the quantized amounts of energy associated 8th
the m, value of each electron, 1t can be seen that the resultant SP
quantum number $ must have a value of O or 1 (Figure 32 6)
