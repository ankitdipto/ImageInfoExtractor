Spin orbit coupling

When several electrons are present in a subshell, the overall effect of the
individual orbital angular momenta / is given by the resultant angular
quantum number L, and the overall effect of the individual spins m, is
given by the resultant spin quantum number S. In an atom, the magnetic
effects of L and S may interact or ‘couple’, giving a new quantum number J
called the total angular momentum quantum number, which results from
vectorial combination of L and S. This coupling of the resulting spin and
orbital quantum numbers is called Russell—-Saunders or LS coupling.

Spin orbit coupling p* case

It has been shown previously that with a p? arrangement, resultant orbital
quantum number values of L = 2, 1 and 0, and also resultant spin quantum
number values of S = 1 and 0, are obtained. These may be coupled to give
the total angular quantum number J (Figure 32.8).
