Each of these arrangements corresponds to an electronic arrangemeng
sometimes called a spectroscopic state which 1s described by a full term
symbol The letter D indicates that the L quantum number has a value of
two P indicates that L = 1 and S denotes a va'ue of L ~ 0.as desenbeg
previously The lower night hand subscrpt denotes the value of the tota
{quantum number J and the upper left superscript indicates the mulliph
city which has the value of 25 + 1 (where 51s the resultant spin quantuny
‘number) The relauon between the number of unpatred electrons the
resultant spin quantum number Sand the multpheity 1s grven in Table

‘Thus the symbol 'Ds (pronounced triplet D two) indicates a D state
hence L = 2 the muluplicnty 1s three hence $= 1 and the number of
‘unpatred electrons ts 2 and the total quantum number J = 2

Al of the spectroscopic terms denved above, for a p® configuration
would occur for an excited state of carbon 1s? 25° 2p! 3p! However m
the ground state ofthe atom Is 2s” 2p the number of states 1s tmited by
the Paul exctuston principle since no two electrons inthe samme atom ea
have all four quantum numbers the same In the ground state configura
tion the two p electrons both have the same values of n = 2and = 1 sp
they must differ mn at least one of the remaining quantum numbers m orm,
Tus restnction reduces the number ot terms tiom ‘DF YD “Pang

This can be shown by wating down only those electrome arrangements
‘of m and m, which do not violate the Pauh exclusion principle For 5
electrons the subsidiary quantum number | = 1 and the magneti:
quantum number may have values from + J» 0—» giving n tis case
Yalues of m = +1 Vand =1 There are 15 possible combinations (Table
32.2) The values of Af and AM (the tata spin and total orbutat quantum
‘numbers inthe 7 direction) are obtained by adding the appropriate ms any
