The L and S quantum numbers associated with each electronic
configuration (and hence the spectroscopic term symbol) can be worked
out from the M, and Ms quantum numbers in Table 32.2. First choose the
maximum Ms value, and select the maximum M, associated with it. This
gives Ms = 1 and M, = 1 (number 10 in table), and corresponds to a group
of terms where L = 1 and S = 1. Since L = 1, this must bé a P state, and
since § = 1, the multiplicity (25 + 1) = 3, so it is in fact a triplet P state 3P.
Using the equations above:

if L = 1, M;, may have the values +1, 0 and —-1
and

if S = 1, Ms may have the values +1, 0 and —1
There are nine combinations of these two terms:
M,= +1 Ms = +1,0,-1
M,=0 Ms = +1.0.-1
M,=~1 Ms = +1,0.-1
Examination of Table 32.2 shows that 13 of the allowed values could be
assigned a +P term symbol.

From the unassigned combinations we next pick out the maximum My
and M,.. In this case My = 0 and M_, = 2. From this it is deduced that L = 2
and 5 = 0. Since L = 2 this must be a D state. The value of S = 0 gives a
multiplicity of 25 + 1 = 1, so it is a singlet D state 'D.

IfL = 2. then M, may have values +2, +1,0. —1 and —2, and since $ =
0. M, = 0. This gives five combinations of M,, and Ms. Examination of
