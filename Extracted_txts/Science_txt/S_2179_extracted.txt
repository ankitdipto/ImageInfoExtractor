HOLE FORMULATION

When a subshell is more than half full, it is simpler and more convenient to
work out the terms by considering the ‘holes’ — that is the vacancies in the
various orbitals — rather than the larger number of electrons actually
present. The terms derived in this way for the ground state of oxygen which
has a p* configuration and hence two ‘holes’ are the same as for carbon
with ap? configuration, that is 'S, 1D and >P. However, oxygen has a more
than half filled subshell, and hence when applying Hund’s third rule, the
energy of the triplet P states for oxygen are *P, <>P, < Pp, making >P2
the ground state. In a similar way, by considering ‘holes’, the terms which
arise for pairs of atoms with p” and p®" arrangements, and also d” and
d'°"", give rise to identical terms (Table 32.3).
