CALCULATION OF THE NUMBER OF MICROSTATES
Each different arrangement of electrons in a set of orbitals has a slightly
different energy and 1s called a microstate, eg Table 322 for ap?
arrangement or Table 324 for a d? arrangement The number of
Imicrostates may be calculated from the number of orbitals andthe number
of electrons, using the formula

() Sa
where 1s twice the number of orbitals and r1s the number of electrons

(Note 4s factornal n and r? as factorial r ) Thus for a p* case there afe
three orbitals so. = 6, and three electrons so r= 3 Hence

Sumtatly, fora d? case there are five orbitals so n = 10, and two electross
sor=2 Hence

Ina similar way the number of microstates can be worked out fr all ofthe
‘hetiromie arrangements p*=?* and aa
