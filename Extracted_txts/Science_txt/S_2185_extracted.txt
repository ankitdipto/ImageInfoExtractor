SPLITTING OF ELECTRONIC ENERGY LEVELS AND
SPECTROSCOPIC STATES

Ans orbital is spherically symmetrical and is unaffected by an octahedral
(or any other) field. p orbitals are directional, and p orbitals are affected by
an octahedral field. However, since a set of three p orbitals are all affected
equally, their energy levels remain equal, and no splitting occurs. A set of
d orbitals is split by an octahedral field into two levels ty, and e,. The
difference in energy between these may be written as A, or 10D,. The lop
level is triply degenerate and is 4D, below the barycentre, and the &e level
is doubly degenerate and is 6Dz, above the barycentre. For a‘ d! con-
figuration, the ground state is a “D state, and the thy and e, electronic
energy levels correspond with the Tz, and E, spectroscopic states. A set of
f orbitals is split by an octahedral field into three levels. For an fi
arrangement the ground state is a *F state and is split into a triply
degenerate 7), state which is 6D, below the barycentre, a triply degenerate
Tyg level which is 2D, above the barycentre and a single Az, State which is
12D, above the barycentre (Figure 32.11). We will see later that the same
arrangement of states occurs with d? arrangement.

Figure 32.11 Splitting of spectroscopic terms arising from (a) d! electronic arrange-
ment and (b) d? electronic arrangement.

In the ‘one electro

n cases’ s', p', d' and f' there is a direct correspondence
between the

ficld pitting of electronic energy levels which occurs in a crystal
Cid and the splitting of spectroscopic states. Thus in an octahedral field

the s and P states are not split. D states are split into two states and F states
are split into three states,
