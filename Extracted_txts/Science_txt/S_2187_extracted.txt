absorption spectrum of [Ti(H20),]°* which is shown in Figure 32.12b,
shows only one band with a peak at 20300cm7!. The magnitude of the
splitting Ag depends on the nature of the ligands, and affects the energy of
the transition, and hence the frequency of maximum absorption in the
spectrum. Thus the peak occurs at 13000 cm™? in [TiClg]>~, 18 900cm™? in
[TiF.}-, 20300 cm™? in [Ti(H2O),}°* and 22300 cm™! in [Ti(CN),]°~. The
amount of splitting caused by various ligands is related to their position in
the spectrochemical series (see Chapter 7). The effect of an octahedral
ligand field on a d' ion is shown in Figure 32.13. The symbol 7D at the left
is the ground state term for a free ion with a d' configuration (see Table
32.3). Under the influence of a ligand field this splits into two states which
are described by the Mulliken symbols *E, and ?T2,. (These symbols
originate in group theory, and are used here without attempting to derive
them. Useful references are given at the end of the chapter.) The lower To.
state corresponds to the single d electron occupying one of the fy, orbitals,
and the °E, state corresponds to the electron occupying one of the ¢,
orbitals. The two states are separated more widely as the strength of the
ligand field increases.

Octahedral complexes of ions with a d°® configuration such as
{Cu(H,0),}’* can be described in a similar way to the Ti?* octahedral
complexes with a d’ arrangement. In the d! case there is a single electron
in the lower tg level whilst in the d° case there is a single hole in the upper
¢, level. Thus the transition in the d! case is promoting an electron from
the 4 level to the e, level, whilst in the d® case it is simpler to consider the
Promotion of an electron as the transfer of a ‘hole’ from e, to fa. The
energy diagram for d° is therefore the other way round, that is the inverse
of that for a d? configuration (Figure 31.14).

If the effect of a tetrahedral ligand field is now considered, the degen-
