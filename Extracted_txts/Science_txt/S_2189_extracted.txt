has the opposite spin to all the other electrons, to the e, level. The energy
level diagram for d° high-spin octahedral complexes is the same as the d!
case (Figure 32.13). ae :

By similar reasoning. octahedral complexes containing @ jons in a high-
spin arrangement (Figure 32.15b) may be considered as having one ‘hole’
in the upper ey level and thus they are analogous to the @° octahedral case
(Figure 32.14). ;

In addition, d° tetrahedral compiexes have only one electron which can
be promoted without changing the spin, and have a diagram like that for d!
tetrahedral, which is qualitatively similar to that for the d” octahedral case.
Finally, d* and d’ tetrahedral complexes with one ‘hole’ are qualitatively
like the d' octahedral example with one electron.

Figures 32.13 and 32.14 can be combined into a single diagram (Figure
32.16) called an Orgel diagram, which describes in a qualitative way the
effect of electron configurations with one electron, one electron more than
a half filled level, one electron less than a full shell, and one electron
less than a half filled shell.

SPECTRA OF d? AND d® IONS

The ground state for a d? electronic arrangement has two electrons in
different orbitals. In an octahedral field the d orbitals are split into three t2,
orbitals of lower energy and two é, orbitals of higher energy, and the
clecttons will occupy two of the bog orbitals. When an electron is promoted
(e4)* ~> (€) (a9)! there are two possibilities. It requires less energy to
Promote an electron from the d,. or dy, orbitals to the d,: orbital than it
