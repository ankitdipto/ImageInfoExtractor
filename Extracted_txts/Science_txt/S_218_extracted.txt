The cell proliferation-signaling pathway. Binding of a growth factor sets in motion a cascading intracellular signaling pathway
(described in chapter 7), which activates nuclear regulatory proteins that trigger cell division. In this example, when the nuclear protein Rb
is phosphorylated, another nuclear protein (myc) is released and is then able to stimulate the production of Cdk proteins.

factors, like PDGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF), af-
fect a broad range of cell types, while others affect only
specific types. For example, nerve growth factor (NGF)
promotes the growth of certain classes of neurons, and ery-
thropoietin triggers cell division in red blood cell precur-
sors. Most animal cells need a combination of several dif-
ferent growth factors to overcome the various controls that
inhibit cell division.

The Go Phase. If cells are deprived of appropriate
growth factors, they stop at the G; checkpoint of the cell
cycle. With their growth and division arrested, they remain
in the Go phase, as we discussed earlier. This nongrowing
state is distinct from the interphase stages of the cell cycle,
Gi, S, and G>.

It is the ability to enter Go that accounts for the in-
credible diversity seen in the length of the cell cycle
among different tissues. Epithelial cells lining the gut di-
vide more than twice a day, constantly renewing the lin-
ing of the digestive tract. By contrast, liver cells divide
only once every year or two, spending most of their time
in Go phase. Mature neurons and muscle cells usually
never leave Go.

 

â€˜Two groups of proteins, cyclins and Cdks, interact to
regulate the cell cycle. Cells also receive protein signals
called growth factors that affect cell division.
