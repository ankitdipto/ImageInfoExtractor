does 1o promote the electron tothe dy orbital, This difference ieneegy
anses because the former transition gives a (d,)'(d~)! arrangement where
the electrons are spread around all three directions x. » and z which
reduces electron-electron repulsion compared with the (d,.)(d,
‘arrangement where the electrons are confined to the x) plane If both
electrons are promoted another high energy state wall be formed Thus
from a consideration of the electrons we would expect four encray levels

‘Table 32 3 shows that the terms ansing for a d° configuration are the
ground state *F and the excited states 'P. 'G, 'D and 'S. The ground state
Contains two electrons with parallel spins. but the 'G, 'D and 'S states
contain electrons with opposite spins ‘Thus transitions from the ground
state to these three states are spin forbidden, wal be very weak. and can be
ignored The two remaining states °F and 2P can have spin permuted
‘transitions Ht will be remembered that p orbitals are not split by an
‘octahedral field, but that forbitals are split into three levels Similarly nan
‘octahedral field P states are not sphit (but are transformed into a Ty state,
and F states split 110 Aze + Tig + Tog (See Figure 32 11 and Table 328)
‘The energy level diagram for these is shown in Figure 32 17a

Three transitions are possible from the ground state *7i,(F) t0 °T.,
ST,(P) and "As, respectwvely, and hence three peaks should appear inthe
spectrum (This may be compared with only one transition in the d! ease}
