Figure 32.17 Orgel diagram and spectrum for a d? ion. (a) Energy diagram tor d¢
configuration in octahedral field (simplified by including only the triplet states)
showing three possible transitions. (b) Ultraviolet—visible absorption spectrum for
the d° complex [V(H20)¢]**.

The spectrum of a d? complex ion [V(H20),}°* is shown in Figure
32.17. Only two peaks occur in this spectrum because the ligand field
strength of water results in transitions occurring close to the cross-over
point between the 7),(P) and °Az, levels, and hence these two transitions
are not resolved into two separate peaks. A V°* ion complexed with a
different ligand would show three peaks.

Complexes of metals such as Ni?* with a d® configuration in an
octahedral field can be treated in a similar way. There are two ‘holes’ in the
€, level, and hence promoting an electron is equivalent to transferring a
‘hole’ from €z 0 tog. This is the inverse of the d? case. The >P state is not
split, and is not inverted, but the >F state is split into three states and is
inverted (Figure 32.18). Thus the ground state term for Ni?* is 7Az,. Note
that in both the d? case and the d® case the 3F state is the lowest in energy.

Thtee spin allowed transitions are observed in the spectra of
INi(H,0),}*, [Ni(NH),]?* and [Ni(ethylenediamine)3]?*

‘Using the same arguments as applied to the d! case, the d? octahedral
energy diagram is similar to the high-spin d’ octahedral, and d? and d*
tetrahedral cases. The inverse diagram applies to the d° and d® octahedral
as well as d? and d’ tetrahedral complexes. As before, the g subscript is
Omitted in tetrahedral complexes.

In a similar way Cr(II1) has a d? configuration, and for octahedral
complexes the inverted diagram at the left hand side of Figure 32.19
applies. This is similar to the d? diagram except that the energies of the
three states derived from the 3F state are inverted in order. The spectra of
chromium complexes would be expected to show three absorption bands
from the ground state Arg to *Top, *Tig(F) and 37,,(P) respectively.
