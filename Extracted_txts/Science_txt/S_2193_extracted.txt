Figure 32.19 Combined Orgel energy level diagram for two-electron and two-
‘hole’ configurations. (Note that the g subscript is omitted in tetrahedral cases.
The same diagram also applies to the d* and d® arrangements except that the
spectroscopic terms are “F and “P, and the Mulliken terms have a multiplicity of 4.)

effect is much more marked on the left of the diagram because the two
levels are close in energy. If the lines had been straight, they-would cross
each other, implying at the cross-over point that two electrons in one atom
may have the same symmetry and the same energy. This would be imposs-
ible, and is prohibited by the non-crossing rule, which says that states of
the same symmetry cannot cross each other. The mixing or interelectronic
tepulsion which causes the bending of the lines is expressed by the Racah
parameters B and C.

The Racah parameters can in principle be calculated from linear com-
binations of exchange integrals and coulomb integrals, but they are usually
obtained empirically from the spectra of free ions. The difference in energy
between states of the same multiplicity for example in a d> ion such as V7*
the separation between *F and ‘P is 15B. Thus if all three bands are
observed in the spectrum, B is readily obtained. In many cases it is
sufficient to use only the parameter B to explain the positions of the bands
in the spectrum. Both the B and C parameters are necessary for terms of
different multiplicity. For example, in the d* V?* ion the separation
between “F and ?G is 4B + 3C. For most transition metal ions B is
approximately 700-1000cm~' and C is approximately four times B.

Experimentally measured spectra may be compared with those expected
from theory. Consider for example the spectra of Cr(III). Cr°* is a d* ion.
(See also Chapter 22.) In the ground state, the dy, dez and dy, orbitals
each contain one electron and the two eé, orbitals are empty. The d®
arrangement gives rise to two states “F and “P. In an octahedral field the “F
