The lowest energy transition correlates perfectly, but agreement for the
other two bands is not very good, Two corrections must be made to
improve the agreement.

1. If some mixing of the P and F terms occurs (bending of lines on the
Orgel diagram), then the energy of the *T\,(P) state is increased by an
amount x and the energy of'the “T\,(F) state is reduced by x.

. The value for the Racah parameter B relates to a free ion. The apparent
value B’ in a complex is always less than the free ion value because
electrons on the metal can be delocalized into molecular orbitals cover-
ing both the metal and the ligands. The use of adjusted B’ values
improves the agreement. This delocalization is called the nephelauxetic
effect, and the nephelauxetic ratio B is defined:

nN

B
Be

f decreases as delocalization increases, and is always less than one, and
B' is usually 0.7B to 0.98). B’ is easily obtained if all three transitions
are observed since:

15B’ = v3 + v2 — 3y,

Using both of these corrections gives much better correlation between
observed and improved theoretical results (Table 32.12). (The use of
adjusted B and C terms is the basis of ligand field calculations.)

As a second example consider the spectrum of crystals of KCoF3. There
are three absorption bands at 7150 cm7', 15 200cm™! and 19 200cm~'. The
compound contains Co?* ions (d’) surrounded octahedrally by six F~ ions.
This case should be similar to the d? case and we would expect transitions
Wt (Tig *Tag)s V2 ("Tig > “Aag) and v3 ('Tig > “Tig(P)). Dg may be
calculated from v, since:

v, = 8D,

However, this makes no allowance for the configuration interaction
between the *7,, and “To, states (i.e. bending of lines on the Orgel
diagram). It is therefore better to evaluate D, from the equation:

V2 — vy = 10D,
Since this is not affected by configuration interaction. Thus:
