Tetrahedral complexes of Co?* such as [CoCl,}?- are intensely blue in
colour with an intensity ¢ of about 600 Imol"'cm~! compared with the
pale pink colour of octahedral complexes with an intensity € of only about
61lmol"!cm~!. Co?* has a d’ electronic configuration, and in [CoCI,]?-
the electrons are arranged (¢,)‘(t,)°. This is similar to the Cr>* (43)
octahedral case since only two electrons can be promoted. There are three
possible transitions: 44, > “TAF), 44,(F) = 4T\(F) and 4A,(F) >
“Ti_(P). Only one band appears in the visible region at 15000cm™!
(Figure 32.22). This band is assigned v3. There are two bands in the
infrared region at 5800cm™' assigned v2 and the lowest energy transition
(assigned vs) is expected at 3300cm7!.

The dé configuration occurs with Mn(II) and Fe(III). In high-spin octa-
hedral complexes formed with weak ligands, for example [Mn"F,]*~,
[Mn"'(H,0),)* and [Fe™F,]>-, there are five unpaired electrons with
Parallel spins. Any electronic transition within the d level must involve a
reversal of spins, and in common with all other ‘spin forbidden’ transitions
any absorption bands will be extremely weak. This accounts for the very
Pale pink colour of most Mn(II) salts, and the pale violet colour of iron(II)
alum. The ground state term is 6S. None of the 11 excited states shown in
Table 32.3 can be attained without reversing the spin of an electron, and
hence the probability of such transitions is extremely low. Of the 11 excited
