states, the four quartets “G, *F, *D and *P involve the reversal of only one

spin The other seven states are doublets, are doubly spin forbidden, and

are unlikely to be observed In an octahedral ficld these four split unto ten

states, and hence up to ten extremely weak absorption bands may be

observed The spectrum of [Mn(H;0),}** 15 shown 1n Figure 3223,

Several features of this spectrum are unusual

1. The bands are extremely weak The molar absorption coefficient ss
about 002-0 03 Lmol~em™!, compared with $10 Imot~'cm™~" for
spin allowed transitions

2 Some of the bands are sharp and others are broad Spin allowed bands
are «avanably broad
