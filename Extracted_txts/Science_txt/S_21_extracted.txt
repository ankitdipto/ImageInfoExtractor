2.2__The atoms of living things are among the smallest.

Kinds of Atoms

There are 92 naturally occurring elements, each with a dif-
ferent number of protons and a different arrangement of
electrons. When the nineteenth-century Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the known elements in a table
according to their atomic mass (figure 2.8), he discovered
one of the great generalizations in all of science. Mendeleev
found that the elements in the table exhibited a pattern of
chemical properties that repeated itself in groups of eight el-
ements. This periodically repeating pattern lent the table its
name: the periodic table of elements.

The Periodic Table

The eight-element periodicity that Mendeleev found is
based on the interactions of the electrons in the outer en-
ergy levels of the different elements. These electrons are
called valence electrons and their interactions are the
basis for the differing chemical properties of the elements.
For most of the atoms important to life, an outer energy

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level can contain no more than eight electrons; the chemi-
cal behavior of an element reflects how many of the eight
positions are filled. Elements possessing all eight elec-
trons in their outer energy level (two for helium) are
inert, or nonreactive; they include helium (He), neon
(Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon
(Rn). In sharp contrast, elements with seven electrons (one
fewer than the maximum number of eight) in their outer
energy level, such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and
bromine (Br), are highly reactive. They tend to gain the
extra electron needed to fill the energy level. Elements
with only one electron in their outer energy level, such as
lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), are also
very reactive; they tend to lose the single electron in their
outer level.

Mendeleev’s periodic table thus leads to a useful generali-
zation, the octet rule (Latin octo, “eight”) or rule of eight:
atoms tend to establish completely full outer energy levels.
Most chemical behavior can be predicted quite accurately
from this simple rule, combined with the tendency of at-
oms to balance positive and negative charges.
