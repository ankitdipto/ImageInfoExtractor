Figure 3225 Tenabe~Sugano diagram for d? case, € g V*

Though it 15 possible to add low spin states to an Orgel diagram
‘Tanabe~Sugano diagrams are commonty used rnstead for the interpreta
‘ton of spectra including both weak and strong fields Tanabe~Sugaro
diagrams ate simular to Orgel diagrams in that they show how the energy
levels change with D,, but they differ in several ways

1. The ground state 1s always taken as the abscissa (horizontal axis) and
provides a constant reference point The other enetgy states are potted
relative to this

2 Low-spin terms, © states where the spin multiplicity 1s lower than the
‘ground state, are included

3 Inorder to make the chagrams general for different metal rons with the
same electronic configuration, and to allow for different ligands bothot
which affect D, and 8 (or B"), the axes are plotted in units of enerey/®
and Dy/B

A different diagram 1s required for each electronic arrangement Only {80
examples are shown here ‘The TS diagram for a d? case such as V""
shown in Figure 3225 Note that in this case there 1s no fundamental
difference between strong and weak fields
