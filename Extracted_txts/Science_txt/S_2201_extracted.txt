terms are shown. There is a discontinuity at 10D,/B = 20, and this is shown
by a vertical line. At this point spin pairing of electrons occurs. To the left
of this line we have high-spin complexes (weak ligand field), and to the
Tight we have low-spin complexes (strong ligand field). The free ion ground
State is“D. This is split by an octahedral field into the *T>_ ground state and
the SE, excited state. The singlet '/ state in the free ion is of high energy.
This is split by the octahedral field into five different states, of which the
"Ate is important. This state is greatly stabilized by the ligand and drops
rapidly in energy as the ligand fieid strength increases. At the point where
10D,/B = 20 the "Aig line crosses the horizontal line for the °T og state
(which is the ground State). At still higher field strengths the 'Aj, state is
the lowest in energy, and becomes the ground state. Since the ground state
is (ken as the horizontal axis, the tight hand part of the diagram must be
Tedrawn.

Since the fluoride ion is a weak field ligand, the complex [CoF,]°*~ is

igh spin. The complex is blue in colour, and a single peak occurs at
13000cm~", This is explained by the transition 57. 5E, shown as an
