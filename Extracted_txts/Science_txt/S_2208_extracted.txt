Figure 2-6 (a) The x(t) curve for anelevator cab 3
that moves upward along an x axis.(b) The v(t) =
curve for the cab. Note that it is the derivative z
of the x(f) curve (v = dx/dt). (c) The a(t) curve <

 

for the cab. It is the derivative of the v(t) curve
(a = dvidt). The stick figures along the bottom
suggest how a passenger’s body might feel dur-
ing the accelerations.

The plus sign indicates that the cab is moving in the posi-
tive x direction. These intervals (where v=0 and v=
4 m/s) are plotted in Fig. 2-6b. In addition, as the cab ini-
tially begins to move and then later slows to a stop,
v varies as indicated in the intervals 1 sto3sand8sto9s.
Thus, Fig. 2-6) is the required plot. (Figure 2-6c is consid-
ered in Module 2-3.)

Given a v(t) graph such as Fig. 2-6b, we could “work
backward” to produce the shape of the associated x(t) graph
(Fig. 2-6a). However, we would not know the actual values
for x at various times, because the v(t) graph indicates
only changes in x. To find such a change in x during any in-

terval, we must, in the language of calculus, calculate the
area “under the curve” on the v(t) graph for that interval.
For example, during the interval 3 s to 8 s in which the cab
has a velocity of 4.0 m/s, the change in x is

Ax = (4.0 m/s)(8.0 s — 3.0 s) = +20 m.

(This area is positive because the v(t) curve is above the
t axis.) Figure 2-6a shows that x does indeed increase by
20 m in that interval. However, Fig. 2-6b does not tell us the
values of x at the beginning and end of the interval. For that,
we need additional information, such as the value of x at
some instant.
