and then as

   

X = Xo + Vavet, (2-12)
in which xp is the position of the particle at ¢ = 0 and Vay, is the average velocity
between ¢ = Oand a later time ¢.

For the linear velocity function in Eq. 2-11, the average velocity over any time
interval (say, from ¢ = 0 to a later time f) is the average of the velocity at the be-
ginning of the interval (= vo) and the velocity at the end of the interval (= v). For
the interval from t = 0 to the later time ¢ then, the average velocity is

Vays = 3(vo + v). (2-13)
Substituting the right side of Eq. 2-11 for v yields, after a little rearrangement,
Vagg = My + at. (2-14)

Finally, substituting Eq. 2-14 into Eq. 2-12 yields
X — Xp = vot + Fat. (2-15)

As a check, note that putting ¢ = 0 yields x = xo, as it must. As a further check,
taking the derivative of Eq. 2-15 yields Eq. 2-11, again as it must. Figure 2-9a
shows a plot of Eq. 2-15; the function is quadratic and thus the plot is curved.

Three Other Equations. Equations 2-11 and 2-15 are the basic equations for
constant acceleration; they can be used to solve any constant acceleration prob-
lem in this book. However, we can derive other equations that might prove useful
in certain specific situations. First, note that as many as five quantities can possi-
bly be involved in any problem about constant acceleration—namely, x — x9, v, t,
a,and vo. Usually, one of these quantities is not involved in the problem, either as
a given or as an unknown. We are then presented with three of the remaining
quantities and asked to find the fourth.

Equations 2-11 and 2-15 each contain four of these quantities, but not the
same four. In Eq. 2-11, the “missing ingredient” is the displacement x — x9. In Eq.
2-15, it is the velocity v. These two equations can also be combined in three ways
to yield three additional equations, each of which involves a different “missing
variable.” First, we can eliminate f¢ to obtain

v2 = vi + 2a(x — Xp). (2-16)

This equation is useful if we do not know ¢ and are not required to find it. Second,
we can eliminate the acceleration a between Egs. 2-11 and 2-15 to produce an
equation in which a does not appear:

X= Xo = 3M + vt. (2-17)
Finally, we can eliminate vp, obtaining
X — Xp = vt — fat. (2-18)

Note the subtle difference between this equation and Eq. 2-15. One involves the
initial velocity vo; the other involves the velocity v at time f.

Table 2-1 lists the basic constant acceleration equations (Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15) as
well as the specialized equations that we have derived.To solve a simple constant ac-
celeration problem, you can usually use an equation from this list (if you have the
list with you). Choose an equation for which the only unknown variable is the vari-
able requested in the problem. A simpler plan is to remember only Eqs. 2-11 and
2-15, and then solve them as simultaneous equations whenever needed.
