26 CHAPTER 2 MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE

To finish the calculation, we substitute Eqs. 2-20, 2-22, and
2-23 into Eq. 2-19, obtaining
2

fat? = on + v,(t — 7.00).
This is a quadratic equation. Substituting in the given data,
we solve the equation (by using the usual quadratic-equa-
tion formula or a polynomial solver on a calculator), finding
t=4.44s andt= 166s.

But what do we do with two answers? Does the car pass
the motorcycle twice? No, of course not, as we can see in the
video. So, one of the answers is mathematically correct but
not physically meaningful. Because we know that the car
passes the motorcycle after the motorcycle reaches its maxi-
mum speed at t = 7.00 s, we discard the solution with t <
7.00 s as being the unphysical answer and conclude that the
passing occurs at

(2-24)

t= 166s. (Answer)

Figure 2-11 is a graph of the position versus time for
the two vehicles, with the passing point marked. Notice

that at t = 7.00 s the plot for the motorcycle switches from
being curved (because the speed had been increasing) to be-
ing straight (because the speed is thereafter constant).

Another Look at Constant Acceleration*

The first two equations in Table 2-1 are the basic equations from which the others
are derived. Those two can be obtained by integration of the acceleration with
the condition that a is constant. To find Eq. 2-11, we rewrite the definition of ac-
celeration (Eq. 2-8) as

dv =adt.

We next write the indefinite integral (or antiderivative) of both sides:

Joo = Je dt.

Since acceleration a is a constant, it can be taken outside the integration. We obtain

or

Jav=afa

veatt+C. (2-25)

To evaluate the constant of integration C, we let f= 0, at which time v = vp.
Substituting these values into Eq. 2-25 (which must hold for all values of t,
including ¢ = 0) yields

vo = (a)(0) +C=C

Substituting this into Eq. 2-25 gives us Eq. 2-11.
To derive Eq. 2-15, we rewrite the definition of velocity (Eq. 2-4) as

dx = vdt

and then take the indefinite integral of both sides to obtain
