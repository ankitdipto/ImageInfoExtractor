28 CHAPTER 2 MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE

oO The free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface is a = —g = —9.8 m/s”, and the
magnitude of the acceleration is g = 9.8 m/s”. Do not substitute —9.8 m/s? for g.

Suppose you toss a tomato directly upward with an initial (positive) velocity vo
and then catch it when it returns to the release level. During its free-fall flight (from
just after its release to just before it is caught), the equations of Table 2-1 apply to its
motion. The acceleration is always a = —g = —9.8 m/s”, negative and thus down-
ward. The velocity, however, changes, as indicated by Eqs. 2-11 and 2-16: during the
ascent, the magnitude of the positive velocity decreases, until it momentarily be-
comes zero. Because the tomato has then stopped, it is at its maximum height.
During the descent, the magnitude of the (now negative) velocity increases.

Iv] Checkpoint 5

(a) If you toss a ball straight up, whatis the sign of the ball’s displacement for the ascent,
from the release point to the highest point? (b) Whatis it for the descent, from the high-
est point back to the release point? (c) Whatis the ball’s acceleration at its highest point?

Sample Problem 2.05 Time for full up-down flight, baseball toss

In Fig. 2-13, a pitcher tosses a baseball up along a y axis, with
an initial speed of 12 m/s. od

(a) How long does the ball take to reach its maximum height?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Once the ball leaves the pitcher and before it returns to
his hand, its acceleration is the free-fall acceleration a = —g.
Because this is constant, Table 2-1 applies to the motion.
(2) The velocity v at the maximum height must be 0.

Calculation: Knowing v, a, and the initial velocity
Vo = 12 m/s, and seeking t, we solve Eq. 2-11, which contains
those four variables. This yields

v— Vo 0—12m/s

(b) What is the ball’s maximum height above its release point?

 

Calculation: We can take the ball’s release point to be yp =
‘We can then write Eq. 2-16 in y notation, set y — yp = y and v =
0 (at the maximum height), and solve for y.We get

(c) How long does the ball take to reach a point 5.0 m above
its release point?

Calculations: We know vo, a = —g, and displacement y —
Yo = 5.0 m, and we want f, so we choose Eq. 2-15. Rewriting
it for y and setting yp = 0 give us

The equations of free fall apply
for rising as well as for falling
objects, provided any effects
from the air can be neglected.

or 5.0m = (12 mis)t — ()(9.8 mis?)??.
If we temporarily omit the units (having noted that they are
consistent), we can rewrite this as

4.91? — 12t + 5.0 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation for t yields

t=053s and t=19s. (Answer)

There are two such times! This is not really surprising
because the ball passes twice through y = 5.0 m, once on the
way up and once on the way down.
