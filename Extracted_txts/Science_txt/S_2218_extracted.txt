2.19 Determine a particle's change in position by graphical
integration on a graph of velocity versus time.

 

@ On agraph of acceleration a versus time t, the change in
the velocity is given by

The integral amounts to finding an area on the graph:

Integrating Acceleration. When we have a graph of an object’s acceleration a ver-
sus time f, we can integrate on the graph to find the velocity at any given time.
Because a is defined as a = dv/dt, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that

Vi Vo = I adt.

The right side of the equation is a definite integral (it gives a numerical result rather
than a function), vp is the velocity at time , and v, is the velocity at later time f,. The def-
inite integral can be evaluated from an a(t) graph, such as in Fig. 2-14a. In particular,

If a unit of acceleration is 1 m/s* and a unit of time is 1 s, then the correspon-

ding unit of area on the graph is

(1 m/s’)(1 s) = 1 més,

which is (properly) a unit of velocity. When the acceleration curve is above the time
axis, the area is positive; when the curve is below the time axis, the area is negative.
Integrating Velocity. Similarly, because velocity v is defined in terms of the posi-

tion x as v = dx/dt, then ; Area

If the unit of velocity is 1 m/s and the unit of time is 1s, then the corre- (b)

sponding unit of area on the graph is

(1 m/s)(1 s) = 1m,

which is (properly) a unit of position and displacement. Whether this area is posi-
tive or negative is determined as described for the a(t) curve of Fig.2-14a.

Figure 2-14 The area between a plotted
curve and the horizontal time axis, from
time fy to time f,, is indicated for (a) a
graph of acceleration a versus t and (b) a
graph of velocity v versus t.
