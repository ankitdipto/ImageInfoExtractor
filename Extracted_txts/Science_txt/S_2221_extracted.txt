give the velocity v(t) for (a) the dropped egg
and (b) the thrown egg? (Curves A and B are fl
parallel; so are C, D,and E;so are F and G.)

8 The following equations give the velocity

v(t) of a particle in four situations: (a) v = 3; (b)

v= 4 + 2t— 6:(c) v = 3t— 4: (d) v = 50? — 3. '
To which of these situations do the equations of
Table 2-1 apply?

9 In Fig. 2-22, a cream tangerine is thrown di-
rectly upward past three evenly spaced windows
of equal heights. Rank the windows according '
to (a) the average speed of the cream tangerine
while passing them, (b) the time the cream tan-
gerine takes to pass them, (c) the magnitude of
the acceleration of the cream tangerine while
passing them, and (d) the change Av in the !
speed of the cream tangerine during the pas-
sage, greatest first. Figure 2-22

Question 9.
10 Suppose that a passenger intent on lunch

during his first ride in a hot-air balloon accidently drops an apple
over the side during the balloon’s liftoff. At the moment of the

<Problems

apple's release, the balloon is accelerating upward with a magni-
tude of 4.0 m/s? and has an upward velocity of magnitude 2 m/s.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the acceleration of
the apple just after it is released? (c) Just then, is the apple moving
upward or downward, or is it stationary? (d) What is the magni-
tude of its velocity just then? (e) In the next few moments, does the
speed of the apple increase, decrease, or remain constant?

11 Figure 2-23 shows that a particle moving along an x axis un-
dergoes three periods of acceleration. Without written computa-
tion, rank the acceleration periods according to the increases
they produce in the particle’s velocity, greatest first.

Module 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity
*1 While driving a car at 90 km/h, how far do you move while
your eyes shut for 0.50 s during a hard sneeze?

°2 Compute your average velocity in the following two cases:
(a) You walk 73.2 m at a speed of 1.22 m/s and then run 73.2 mat a
speed of 3.05 m/s along a straight track. (b) You walk for 1.00 min
at a speed of 1.22 m/s and then run for 1.00 min at 3.05 m/s along a
straight track.|(@)|Graph x versus ¢ for both cases and indicate how
the average velocity is found on the graph.

*3 SSM WWW An automobile travels on a straight road for
40 km at 30 km/h. It then continues in the same direction for an-
other 40 km at 60 km/h. (a) What is the average velocity of the car
during the full 80 km trip? (Assume that it moves in the positive x
direction.) (b) What is the average speed? (€)|Graph x versus ¢ and
indicate how the average velocity is found on the graph.

°4 A car moves uphill at 40 km/h and then back downhill at 60
km/h. What is the average speed for the round trip?

*5 SSM The position of an object moving along an x axis is given
by x = 3r — 4° + &, where x is in meters and fin seconds. Find the
position of the object at the following values of t: (a) 1s, (b) 2s,
(c) 3 s,and (d) 4s. (e) What is the object’s displacement between t = 0
and t = 4s? (f) What is its average velocity for the time interval
fromt=2stot=4s Graph x versus t for 0 = t= 4 and indi-
cate how the answer for (f).can be found on the graph.

  

*6 The 1992 world speed record for a bicycle (human-powered
vehicle) was set by Chris Huber. His time through the measured
200m stretch was a sizzling 6.509s, at which he commented,

“Cogito ergo zoom!” (I think, therefore I go fast!). In 2001, Sam
Whittingham beat Huber’s record by 19.0km/h. What was
Whittingham’s time through the 200 m?

“7 Two trains, each having a speed of 30 km/h, are headed at
each other on the same straight track. A bird that can fly 60 km/h
flies off the front of one train when they are 60 km apart and heads
directly for the other train. On reaching the other train, the (crazy)
bird flies directly back to the first train, and so forth. What is the to-
tal distance the bird travels before the trains collide?

68 SS @ Panic escape. Figure 2-24 shows a general situation in
which a stream of people attempt to escape through an exit door
that turns out to be locked. The people move toward the door at
speed v, = 3.50 m/s, are each d = 0.25 m in depth, and are sepa-
rated by L = 1.75m. The
arrangement in Fig, 2-24
occurs at time f = 0. (a) At
what average rate does the
layer of people at the door
increase? (b) At what time
does the layer’s depth reach
5.0 m? (The answers reveal
how quickly such a situation
becomes dangerous.)

9 iLw In] kmraces,runner 1 on track 1 (with time 2 min, 27.95 s)
appears to be faster than runner 2 on track 2 (2 min, 28.15 s).
However, length L, of track 2 might be slightly greater than length
L, of track 1. How large can L, — L; be for us still to conclude that
runner 1 is faster?
