“10 <%= To set a speed record in a measured (straight-line)
distance d,a race car must be driven first in one direction (in time f)

11 @ You are to drive 300 km to an interview. The interview is
at 11:15 A.M. You plan to drive at 100 km/h, so you leave at 8:00
A.M. to allow some extra time. You drive at that speed for the first
100 km, but then construction work forces you to slow to 40 km/h
for 40 km. What would be the least speed needed for the rest of the
trip to arrive in time for the interview?

@QLSS Traffic shock wave. An abrupt slowdown in concen-
trated traffic can travel as a pulse, termed a shock wave, along the
line of cars, either downstream (in the traffic direction) or up-
stream, or it can be stationary. Figure 2-25 shows a uniformly
spaced line of cars moving at speed v = 25.0 m/s toward a uni-
formly spaced line of slow cars moving at speed v, = 5.00 mis.
Assume that each faster car adds length L = 12.0 m (car length
plus buffer zone) to the line of slow cars when it joins the line, and as-
sume it slows abruptly at the last instant. (a) For what separation dis-
tance d between the faster cars does the shock wave remain
stationary? If the separation is twice that amount, what are the (b)
speed and (c) direction (upstream or downstream) of the shock wave?
