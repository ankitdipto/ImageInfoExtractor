34 CHAPTER 2 MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE

the mushroom, a drop grows on one side of the spore and a film
grows on the other side. The spore is bent over by the drop’s weight,
but when the film reaches the drop, the drop’s water suddenly
spreads into the film and the spore springs upward so rapidly that it
is shang off into the air. Typically, the spore reaches a speed of 1.6
m/s in a 5.0 zm launch; its speed is then reduced to zero in 1.0 mm
by the air. Using those data and assuming constant accelerations,
find the acceleration in terms of g during (a) the launch and (b) the
speed reduction.

°25 An electric vehicle starts from rest and accelerates at a rate
of 2.0 nvs? in a straight line until it reaches a speed of 20 m/s. The
vehicle then slows at a constant rate of 1.0 m/s* until it stops. (a)
How much time elapses from start to stop? (b) How far does the
vehicle travel from start to stop?

°26 A muon (an elementary particle) enters a region with a speed
of 5.00 X 10° m/s and then is slowed at the rate of 1.25 x 10" m/s’.
(a) How far does the muon take to stop?\(6)/ Graph x versus ¢ and v
versus f for the muon.

*27 An electron has a constant acceleration of +3.2 m/s’. At a
certain instant its velocity is +9.6 m/s. What is its velocity (a) 2.5 s
earlier and (b) 2.5 s later?

+28 Ona dry road, a car with good tires may be able to brake
with a constant deceleration of 4.92 m/s*. (a) How long does such
a car, initially traveling at 24.6 m/s, take to stop? (b) How far does
it travel in this time?|(@)/Graph x versus ¢ and v versus ¢ for the
deceleration.

#29\\uw A certain elevator cab has a total run of 190 m and a max-
imum speed of 305 m/min, and it accelerates from rest and then
back to rest at 1.22 m/s*. (a) How far does the cab move while ac-
celerating to full speed from rest? (b) How long does it take to
make the nonstop 190 m run, starting and ending at rest?

30 The brakes on your car can slow you at a rate of 5.2 m/s’. (a)
If you are going 137 km/h and suddenly see a state trooper, what is
the minimum time in which you can get your car under the 90 km/h
speed limit? (The answer reveals the futility of braking to keep
our high speed from being detected with a radar or laser gun.)
Graph x versus t and v versus t for such a slowing.

*31 SSM Suppose a rocket ship in deep space moves with con-
stant acceleration equal to 9.8 m/s*, which gives the illusion of nor-
mal gravity during the flight. (a) If it starts from rest, how long will
it take to acquire a speed one-tenth that of light, which travels at
3.0 X 108 m/s? (b) How far will it travel in so doing?

+32 <= A world’s land speed record was set by Colonel John
P. Stapp when in March 1954 he rode a rocket-propelled sled that
moved along a track at 1020 knv/h. He and the sled were brought to
a stop in 1.4 s. (See Fig. 2-7.) In terms of g, what acceleration did he
experience while stopping?

#33)|ssm iw Acar traveling 56.0 km/h is 24.0 m from a barrier
when the driver slams on the brakes. The car hits the barrier 2.00 s
later. (a) What is the magnitude of the car’s constant acceleration
before impact? (b) How fast is the car traveling at impact?

34) @) In Fig. 2-27,a red car and a green car, identical except for the
color, move toward each other in adjacent lanes and parallel to an x
axis. At time f = 0, the red car is at x, = 0 and the green car is at x, =
220 m. If the red car has a constant velocity of 20 km/h, the cars pass
each other at x = 44.5 m, and if it has a constant velocity of 40 km/h,
they pass each other at x = 76.6 m. What are (a) the initial velocity
and (b) the constant acceleration of the green car?

each other. Figure 2-28 is a graphof

their motion, showing the positions

Xy = 270m and x = —35.0m at :

time ¢ = 0. The green car hasacon- 9 12
stant speed of 20.0 m/s and the red #(s)

car begins from rest. What is the ac-
celeration magnitude of the red car?

36 A car moves along an x axis through a distance of 900 m,
starting at rest (at x =0) and ending at rest (at x = 900m).
Through the first } of that distance, its acceleration is +2.25 m/s”.
Through the rest of that distance, its acceleration is —0.750 m/s.
What are (a) its travel time through the 900 m and (b) its maxi-
mum speed? (@JGraph position x, velocity v, and acceleration a
versus time t for the trip.

87) Figure 2-29 depicts the motion
of a particle moving along an x axis
with a constant acceleration. The fig- *
ure’s vertical scaling is set by x, = 6.0m.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) di-
rection of the particle’s acceleration?

that is tolerable for passengers in a rT 2
subway train is 1.34 m/s? and subway
stations are located 806 m apart, what
is the maximum speed a subway train
can attain between stations? (b) What
is the travel time between stations? (c) If a subway train stops for 20s
at each station, what is the maximum average speed of the train, from
one start-up to the next?((@)|Graph x, v, and a versus t for the interval
from one start-up to the next.

39) Cars A and B move in
the same direction in adjacent
lanes. The position x of car A is
given in Fig, 2-30, from time
t =0 tot=7.0s. The figure’s
vertical scaling is set by x, =
32.0 m. At t= 0,car Bis atx =
0, with a velocity of 12 m/s and
a negative constant accelera-
tion ag. (a) What must ag be
such that the cars are (momen-
tarily) side by side (momentarily at the same value of x) at t = 4.0 s?
(b) For that value of ay, how many times are the cars side by side?
(c) Sketch the position x of car B versus time f on Fig. 2-30. How
many times will the cars be side by side if the magnitude of accelera-
tion ag is (d) more than and (e) less than the answer to part (a)?

B40) You are driving toward a traffic signal when it turns yel-
low. Your speed is the legal speed limit of vy = 55 km/h; your best
deceleration rate has the magnitude a = 5.18 m/s”. Your best reaction
time to begin braking is T = 0.75 s To avoid having the front of your
car enter the intersection after the light turns red, should you
brake to a stop or continue to move at 55 km/h if the distance to
