*°70 Two particles move along an x axis. The position of particle 1
is given by x = 6.00 + 3.00f + 2.00 (in meters and seconds); the ac-
celeration of particle 2 is given by a = —8.00f (in meters per second
squared and seconds) and, at f = 0, its velocity is 20 m/s. When the
velocities of the particles match, what is their velocity?

71 In an arcade video game, a spot is programmed to move
across the screen according to x = 9.00f — 0.7501°, where x is dis-
tance in centimeters measured from the left edge of the screen and
t is time in seconds. When the spot reaches a screen edge, at either
x = Oorx = 15.0 cm, ris reset to 0 and the spot starts moving again
according to x(f). (a) At what time after starting is the spot instan-
taneously at rest? (b) At what value of x does this occur? (c) What
is the spot’s acceleration (including sign) when this occurs? (d)
Is it moving right or left just prior to coming to rest? (e) Just after?
(f) At what time ¢ > 0 does it first reach an edge of the screen?

72 A rock is shot vertically upward from the edge of the top of a
tall building. The rock reaches its maximum height above the top of
the building 1.60 s after being shot. Then, after barely missing the
edge of the building as it falls downward, the rock strikes the ground
6.00 s after it is launched. In SI units: (a) with what upward velocity
is the rock shot, (b) what maximum height above the top of the
building is reached by the rock, and (c) how tall is the building?

73 @ At the instant the traffic light turns green, an automobile
starts with a constant acceleration a of 2.2 m/s*. At the same instant
a truck, traveling with a constant speed of 9.5 m/s, overtakes and
passes the automobile. (a) How far beyond the traffic signal will
the automobile overtake the truck? (b) How fast will the automo-
bile be traveling at that instant?

74 A pilot flies horizontally at 1300 km/h, at height A = 35m
above initially level ground. However, at time f = 0, the pilot be-
gins to fly over ground sloping upward at angle 0 = 4.3° (Fig. 2-41).
If the pilot does not change the airplane's heading, at what time ¢
does the plane strike the ground?

75 © To stopa car, first you require a certain reaction time to be-
gin braking; then the car slows at a constant rate. Suppose that the
total distance moved by your car during these two phases is 56.7 m
when its initial speed is 80.5 km/h, and 24.4 m when its initial speed
is 48.3 km/h. What are (a) your reaction time and (b) the magni-
tude of the acceleration?

reached intersection 2, where the green appeared when they were
distance d from the intersection. They continue to travel at a cer-
tain speed v, (the speed limit) to reach intersection 3, where the
green appears when they are distance d from it. The intersections
are separated by distances D,; and Dj. (a) What should be the
time delay of the onset of green at intersection 3 relative to that at
intersection 2 to keep the platoon moving smoothly?

Suppose, instead, that the platoon had been stopped by a red
light at intersection 1. When the green comes on there, the leaders
require a certain time f, to respond to the change and an additional
time to accelerate at some rate a to the cruising speed v,. (b) If the
green at intersection 2 is to appear when the leaders are distance d
from that intersection, how long after the light at intersection 1
turns green should the light at intersection 2 turn green?

77 ssM A hot rod can accelerate from 0 to 60 km/h in 54s.
(a) What is its average acceleration, in m/s’, during this time? (b)
How far will it travel during the 5.4 s, assuming its acceleration is con-
stant? (c) From rest, how much time would it require to go a distance
of 0.25 km if its acceleration could be maintained at the value in (a)?

78 ® Ared train traveling at 72 km/h and a green train traveling
at 144 km/h are headed toward each other along a straight, level
track. When they are 950 m apart, each engineer sees the other’s
train and applies the brakes. The brakes slow each train at the rate
of 1.0 mvs*. Is there a collision? If so, answer yes and give the speed
of the red train and the speed of the green train at impact, respec-
tively. If not, answer no and give the separation between the trains
when they stop.

79 ® At time r= 0,a rock
climber accidentally allows a
piton to fall freely from a high
point on the rock wall to the
valley below him. Then, after a
short delay, his climbing part-
ner, who is 10 m higher on the
wall, throws a piton down-
ward. The positions y of the £(s)

With what speed is the second piton thrown?

 

80 A train started from rest and moved with constant accelera-
tion. At one time it was traveling 30 m/s, and 160 m farther on it
was traveling 50 m/s. Calculate (a) the acceleration, (b) the time re-
quired to travel the 160 m mentioned, (c) the time required to at-
tain the speed of 30 m/s, and (d) the distance moved from rest to
the time the train had a speed of 30 m/s. (e) Graph x versus t and v
versus ¢ for the train, from rest.

81 ssM A particle’s acceleration along an x axis is a = 5.04, with ¢

second squared. At f= 2.05, a(m/s’)

its velocity is +17 m/s. What is 4,
its velocity att = 4.0s?

the particle’s velocity is 7.0
m/s. What is its velocity at t =
6.08?
