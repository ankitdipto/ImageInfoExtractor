38 CHAPTER 2 MOTION ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE

83 Figure 2-45 shows a simple device for measuring your
reaction time. It consists of a cardboard strip marked with a scale
and two large dots. A friend holds the strip vertically, with thumb
and forefinger at the dot on the right in Fig. 2-45. You then posi-
tion your thumb and forefinger at the other dot (on the left in
Fig. 2-45), being careful not to touch the strip. Your friend re-
leases the strip, and you try to pinch it as soon as possible after
you see it begin to fall. The mark at the place where you pinch the
strip gives your reaction time. (a) How far from the lower dot
should you place the 50.0 ms mark? How much higher should
you place the marks for (b) 100, (c) 150, (d) 200, and (e) 250 ms?
(For example, should the 100 ms marker be 2 times as far from
the dot as the 50 ms marker? If so, give an answer of 2 times. Can
you find any pattern in the answers?)

84 <= A rocket-driven sled running on a straight, level track is
used to investigate the effects of large accelerations on humans.
One such sled can attain a speed of 1600 km/h in 18 s, starting
from rest. Find (a) the acceleration (assumed constant) in terms of
gand (b) the distance traveled.

85 A mining cart is pulled up a hill at 20 km/h and then pulled
back down the hill at 35 km/h through its original level. (The time
required for the cart’s reversal at the top of its climb is negligible.)
What is the average speed of the cart for its round trip, from its
original level back to its original level?

86 A motorcyclist who is moving along an x axis directed to-
ward the east has an acceleration given by a = (6.1 — 1.2r) m/s*
for 0 = t = 6.0s. Att = 0, the velocity and position of the cyclist
are 2.7 m/s and 7.3 m. (a) What is the maximum speed achieved
by the cyclist? (b) What total distance does the cyclist travel be-
tween f = 0 and 6.0 s?

87 SSM When the legal speed limit for the New York Thruway
was increased from 55 mi/h to 65 mi/h, how much time was saved
by a motorist who drove the 700 km between the Buffalo entrance
and the New York City exit at the legal speed limit?

88 Acar moving with constant acceleration covered the distance
between two points 60.0 m apart in 6.00 s. Its speed as it passed the
second point was 15.0 m/s. (a) What was the speed at the first
point? (b) What was the magnitude of the acceleration? (c) At
what prior distance from the first point was the car at rest? (d) Graph
Xx versus t and v versus ¢ for the car, from rest (t = 0).

89 SSM —@ A certain juggler usually tosses balls vertically to
a height H. To what height must they be tossed if they are to spend
twice as much time in the air?

90 A particle starts from the ori- vy
gin at t= 0 and moves along the

positive x axis. A graph of the veloc- @

ity of the particle as a function of the £

time is shown in Fig. 2-46; the v-axis_*

scale is set by v, = 4.0 m/s. (a) What

is the coordinate of the particle at o 12 3 4 5 6
t = 5.0 s? (b) What is the velocity of t(s)

the particle at ¢ = 5.0 s? (c) What is Figure 2-46 Problem 90.

the acceleration of the particle at t = 5.0 s? (d) What is the average ve-
locity of the particle between t = 1.0s and t = 5.0s? (e) What is the
average acceleration of the particle between tf = 1.0 sandt = 5.0s?

91 A rock is dropped from a 100-m-high cliff. How long does it
take to fall (a) the first 50 m and (b) the second 50 m?

92 Two subway stops are separated by 1100 m. If a subway train
accelerates at +1.2 m/s? from rest through the first half of the dis-
tance and decelerates at —1.2 m/s* through the second half, what
are (a) its travel time and (b) its maximum speed? (c) Graph x, v,
and a versus t for the trip.

93 A stone is thrown vertically upward. On its way up it passes
point A with speed v,and point B, 3.00 m higher than A, with speed
4y. Calculate (a) the speed v and (b) the maximum height reached
by the stone above point B.

94 A rock is dropped (from rest) from the top of a 60-m-tall
building. How far above the ground is the rock 12s before it
reaches the ground?

95 ssm An iceboat has a constant velocity toward the east when
a sudden gust of wind causes the iceboat to have a constant accel-
eration toward the east for a period of 3.0 s. A plot of x versus ris
shown in Fig. 2-47, where ¢ = 0 is taken to be the instant the wind
starts to blow and the positive x axis is toward the east. (a) What is
the acceleration of the iceboat during the 3.0 s interval? (b) What
is the velocity of the iceboat at the end of the 3.0s interval? (c) If
the acceleration remains constant for an additional 3.0 s, how far
does the iceboat travel during this second 3.0 s interval?

96 A lead ball is dropped in a lake from a diving board 5.20 m
above the water. It hits the water with a certain velocity and then
sinks to the bottom with this same constant velocity. It reaches the
bottom 4.80 s after it is dropped. (a) How deep is the lake? What
are the (b) magnitude and (c) direction (up or down) of the aver-
age velocity of the ball for the entire fall? Suppose that all the wa-
ter is drained from the lake. The ball is now thrown from the diving
board so that it again reaches the bottom in 4.80 s. What are the
(d) magnitude and (e) direction of the initial velocity of the ball?

97 The single cable supporting an unoccupied construction ele-
vator breaks when the elevator is at rest at the top of a 120-m-high
building. (a) With what speed does the elevator strike the ground?
(b) How long is it falling? (c) What is its speed when it passes the
halfway point on the way down? (d) How long has it been falling
when it passes the halfway point?

98 Two diamonds begin a free fall from rest from the same
height, 1.0 s apart. How long after the first diamond begins to fall
will the two diamonds be 10 m apart?

99 A ball is thrown vertically downward from the top of a 36.6-
m-tall building. The ball passes the top of a window that is 12.2m
above the ground 2.00 s after being thrown. What is the speed of
the ball as it passes the top of the window?
