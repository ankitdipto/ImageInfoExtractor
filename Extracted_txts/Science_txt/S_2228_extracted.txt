braking begins until the motorcycle stops?

106 A shuffleboard disk is accelerated at a constant rate from rest

average velocity is 3400 kn/h?

111 Acertain sprinter has a top speed of 11.0 m/s. If the sprinter
starts from rest and accelerates at a constant rate, he is able to
reach his top speed in a distance of 12.0 m. He is then able to main-
tain this top speed for the remainder of a 100 m race. (a) What is
his time for the 100 m race? (b) In order to improve his time, the
sprinter tries to decrease the distance required for him to reach his

10.0s for the race?

112 The speed of a bullet is measured to be 640 m/s as the bullet
emerges from a barrel of length 1.20 m. Assuming constant accelera-

113 The Zero Gravity Research Facility at the NASA Glenn
Research Center includes a 145 m drop tower. This is an evacuated ver-
tical tower through which, among other possibilities, a 1-m-diameter
sphere containing an experimental package can be dropped. (a)

find its magnitude in (a) SI units and (b) in terms of g.(c) How much
time 7), is required for the braking? Your reaction time T, is the time
you require to perceive an emergency, move your foot to the brake,
and begin the braking. If T, = 400 ms, then (d) what is 7; in terms of
T,, and (e) is most of the full time required to stop spent in reacting
or braking? Dark sunglasses delay the visual signals sent from the

116 Most important in an investigation of an airplane crash by the
US. National Transportation Safety Board is the data stored on the
airplane’s flight-data recorder, commonly called the “black box” in
spite of its orange coloring and reflective tape. The recorder is engi-
neered to withstand a crash with an average deceleration of magni-
tude 3400g during a time interval of 6.50 ms. In such a crash, if the
recorder and airplane have zero speed at the end of that time inter-
val, what is their speed at the beginning of the interval?

of South America, to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, covering 30 600 km. In
meters per second, what was the magnitude of his average velocity
during that time period?

118 The wings ona stonefly do not flap, and thus the insect cannot
fly. However, when the insect is on a water surface, it can sail across
the surface by lifting its wings into a breeze. Suppose that you time
stoneflies as they move at constant speed along a straight path of a
certain length. On average, the trips each take 7.1 s with the wings
set as sails and 25.0 s with the wings tucked in. (a) What is the ratio of
the sailing speed v, to the nonsailing speed v,,? (b) In terms of v,,
