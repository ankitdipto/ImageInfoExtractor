42 CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

Start

 

You get the same vector
result for either order of
adding vectors.

Figure 3-3 The two vectors @ and B can be
added in either order; see Eq. 3-2.

Figure 3-5 The vectors b and —6 have the
same magnitude and opposite directions.

result as adding to @ (Fig, 3-3); that is,

@+B=B+G — (commutative law). (3-2)

Second, when there are more than two vectors, we can group them in any order
as we add them. Thus, if we want to add vectors @, b, and €, we can add @ and b
first and then add their vector sum to ¢. We can also add b and @ first and then
add that sum to @. We get the same result either way, as shown in Fig. 3-4. That is,

(33)

(associative law).

(@+b)+=a+(+2)

You get the same vector result for
any order of adding the vectors.

  

Figure 3-4 The three vectors @, , and @ can be grouped in any way as they are added; see
Eq. 3-3.

 

The vector —b is a vector with the same magnitude as B but the opposite
direction (see Fig. 3-5). Adding the two vectors in Fig. 3-5 would yield

B+ (-b) =0.

Thus, adding —D has the effect of subtracting b.We use this property to define
the difference between two vectors:let d = @ — b. Then
d=@-b=G@+(-b)  (vectorsubtraction); (3-4)

that is, we find the difference vector d by adding the vector —B to the vector @.
Figure 3-6 shows how this is done geometrically.

As in the usual algebra, we can move a term that includes a vector symbol from
one side of a vector equation to the other, but we must change its sign. For example,
if we are given Eq. 3-4 and need to solve for @, we can rearrange the equation as

d+b=@ or G@=d+b.

Remember that, although we have used displacement vectors here, the rules
for addition and subtraction hold for vectors of all kinds, whether they represent
velocities, accelerations, or any other vector quantity. However, we can add
only vectors of the same kind. For example, we can add two displacements, or two
velocities, but adding a displacement and a velocity makes no sense. In the arith-
metic of scalars, that would be like trying to add 21 s and 12 m.

Iv] Checkpoint 1

The magnitudes of displacements @ and b are 3 mand 4 m,respectively,and ¢ = @ + B.
Considering various orientations of @ and b, what are (a) the maximum possible
magnitude for ¢ and (b) the minimum possible magnitude?

Components of Vectors

Adding vectors geometrically can be tedious. A neater and easier technique
involves algebra but requires that the vectors be placed on a rectangular coordi-
nate system. The x and y axes are usually drawn in the plane of the page, as shown
