3-2 UNIT VECTORS, ADDING VECTORS BY COMPONENTS 47

To start, consider the statement
=@+5, (3-9)

which says that the vector 7 is the same as the vector (@ + b). Thus, each
component of 7 must be the same as the corresponding component of (@ + b):

ry =a, + by (3-10)
rn=a,t+ by (3-11)
r, =a, + b,. (3-12)

In other words, two vectors must be equal if their corresponding components are
equal. Equations 3-9 to 3-12 tell us that to add vectors @ and b, we must (1) re-
solve the vectors into their scalar components; (2) combine these scalar compo-
nents, axis by axis, to get the components of the sum 7; and (3) combine
the components of 7’ to get 7 itself. We have a choice in step 3. We can express 7
in unit-vector notation or in magnitude-angle notation.

This procedure for adding vectors by components | also applies to vector
subtractions. Recall that a subtraction such as d= a- B can be rewritten as an
addition d = @ + (-b).To subtract, we add @ and —b by components, to get

 

d,=a,—b,, dy=a,—by, and d, —b.,
where d=ditdjt+dk. (3-13)

Vectors and the Laws of Physics

So far, in every figure that includes a coordinate system, the x and y axes are par-
allel to the edges of the book page. Thus, when a vector @ is included, its compo-
nents a, and ay are also parallel to the edges (as in Fig. 3-15a).The only reason for
that orientation of the axes is that it looks “proper”; there is no deeper reason.
We could, instead, rotate the axes (but not the vector @) through an angle ¢as in
Fig. 3-155, in which case the components would have new values, call them a‘, and
a',. Since there are an infinite number of choices of ¢, there are an infinite num-
ber of different pairs of components for @.

Which then is the “right” pair of components? The answer is that they are all
equally valid because each pair (with its axes) just gives us a different way of de-
scribing the same vector @; all produce the same magnitude and direction for the
vector. In Fig. 3-15 we have

a=Vat+a= Var +a? (3-14)

0=0 +4 (3-15)

The point is that we have great freedom in choosing a coordinate system, be-
cause the relations among vectors do not depend on the location of the origin or
on the orientation of the axes. This is also true of the relations of physics; they are
all independent of the choice of coordinate system. Add to that the simplicity and
richness of the language of vectors and you can see why the laws of physics are
almost always presented in that language: one equation, like Eq. 3-9, can repre-
sent three (or even more) relations, like Eqs. 3-10,3-11, and 3-12.
