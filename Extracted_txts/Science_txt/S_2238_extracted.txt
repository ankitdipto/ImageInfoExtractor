the vector forms the hypotenuse. We find the magnitude and
angle of d,., with Eq. 3-6. The magnitude is

net = V boet,x + ety (3-18)
= V (13.60 m)? + (—3.07 m)?=13.9m. (Answer)

To find the angle (measured from the positive direction of x),
we take an inverse tangent:

 

6= tan"! ( fu) (3-19)
net
3.07

=tan! (2u2) = -12.7°. (Answer)

The angle is negative because it is measured clockwise from
positive x. We must always be alert when we take an inverse

Sample Problem 3.04 Adding vectors, unit-vector

Figure 3-17a shows the following three vectors:
@ = (42 m)i — (1.5 m)j,

Bb = (-16m)i + (2.9 m)j,

@ = (-3.7m)j.

What is their vector sum 7 which is also shown?

tangent on a calculator. The answer it displays is mathe-
matically correct but it may not be the correct answer for
the physical situation. In those cases, we have to add 180°
to the displayed answer, to reverse the vector. To check,
we always need to draw the vector and its components as
we did in Fig. 3-16d. In our physical situation, the figure
shows us that 9 = —12.7° is a reasonable answer, whereas
—12.7° + 180° = 167° is clearly not.

‘We can see all this on the graph of tangent versus angle
in Fig. 3-12c. In our maze problem, the argument of the in-
verse tangent is —3.07/13.60, or —0.226. On the graph draw
a horizontal line through that value on the vertical axis. The
line cuts through the darker plotted branch at —12.7° and
also through the lighter branch at 167°. The first cut is what
a calculator displays.

KEY IDEA

 

‘We can add the three vectors by components, axis by axis,
and then combine the components to write the vector
sum f.
Calculations: For the x axis, we add the x components of @,
b,and ©, to get the x component of the vector sum 7:
Ty = a, + by + Cy
=42m—16m+0=2.6m.
Similarly, for the y axis,
Pia
=—-15m+29m— 3.7m=—23m.

We then combine these components of 7 to write the vector
in unit-vector notation:

F = (26m)i — (2.3 m)j, (Answer)

where (2.6 m)i is the vector component of 7 along the x axis
and —(2.3m)j is that along the y axis. Figure 3-17b shows
one way to arrange these vector components to form 7.
(Can you sketch the other way?)

‘We can also answer the question by giving the magnitude
and an angle for 7°. From Eq. 3-6, the magnitude is

r= V(2.6m) + (-—2.3m)? =~ 3.5m

and the angle (measured from the +x direction) is
Ge tan-( oe =) = —41°,
