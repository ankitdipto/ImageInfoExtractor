3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS

Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to...

3.09 Multiply vectors by scalars.

3.10 Identify that multiplying a vector by a scalar gives a vec-
tor, taking the dot (or scalar) product of two vectors gives a
scalar, and taking the cross (or vector) product gives a new
vector that is perpendicular to the original two.

3.11 Find the dot product of two vectors in magnitude-angle
notation and in unit-vector notation.

3.12 Find the angle between two vectors by taking their dot prod-
uct in both magnitude-angle notation and unit-vector notation.

Key Ideas

@ The product of a scalar s and a vector V is a new vector
whose magnitude is sv and whose direction is the same as
that of V ifs is positive, and opposite that of V ifs is negative.
To divide V by s, multiply V by 1/s.

@ The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors @ and Dis writ-
ten @- B and is the scalar quantity given by

G+ B =abcos od,
in which dis the angle between the directions of 7 and D.
A scalar product is the product of the magnitude of one vec-

tor and the scalar component of the second vector along the
direction of the first vector. In unit-vector notation,

G@- B= (aitaj t+ ak)-(bi t+ bj + bk),

which may be expanded according to the distributive law.
Note that @-b = B+ @.

3.13 Given two vectors, use a dot product to find how much
of one vector lies along the other vector.

3.14 Find the cross product of two vectors in magnitude-
angle and unit-vector notations.

3.15 Use the right-hand rule to find the direction of the vector
that results from a cross product.

3.16 In nested products, where one product is buried inside
another, follow the normal algebraic procedure by starting
with the innermost product and working outward.

@ The vector (or cross) product of two vectors @ and Dis
written @ x b and is a vector € whose magnitude c is given by

c=absin 4,

in which @ is the smaller of the angles between the directions
of @ and b. The direction of @ is perpendicular to the plane
defined by @ and D and is given by a right-hand rule, as shown
in Fig. 3-19. Note that @ x b = —(b X @). Inunit-vector
notation,

@Xx B= (ait aj t+ ak) x (ba + bj + A),
which we may expand with the distributive law.

@ Innested products, where one product is buried inside an-
other, follow the normal algebraic procedure by starting with
the innermost product and working outward.

 

Multiplying Vectors*

There are three ways in which vectors can be multiplied, but none is exactly like
the usual algebraic multiplication. As you read this material, keep in mind that a
vector-capable calculator will help you multiply vectors only if you understand
the basic rules of that multiplication.

Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar

If we multiply a vector @ by a scalar s, we get a new vector. Its magnitude is
the product of the magnitude of @ and the absolute value of s. Its direction is the
direction of @ ifs is positive but the opposite direction if s is negative. To divide @
by s,we multiply @ by 1/s.

Multiplying a Vector by a Vector

There are two ways to multiply a vector by a vector: one way produces a scalar
(called the scalar product), and the other produces a new vector (called the vector
product). (Students commonly confuse the two ways.)

* This material will not be employed until later (Chapter 7 for scalar products and Chapter 11 for vec
tor products), and so your instructor may wish to postpone it.
