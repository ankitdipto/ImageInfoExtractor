3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS

The Scalar Product

The scalar product of the vectors @ and Din Fig. 3-18a is written as @-B and
defined to be

@-b =abcos ¢, (3-20)

where a is the magnitude of Z, b is the magnitude of b, and ¢ is the angle between
@ and B (or, more properly, between the directions of @ and b). There are actually
two such angles: ¢ and 360° — ¢. Either can be used in Eq. 3-20, because their
cosines are the same.

Note that there are only scalars on the right side of Eq. 3-20 (including the
value of cos ¢).Thus @- B on the left side represents a scalar quantity. Because of
the notation, @- D is also known as the dot product and is spoken as “a dot b.”

A dot product can be regarded as the product of two quantities: (1) the mag-
nitude of one of the vectors and (2) the scalar component of the second vector
along the direction of the first vector. For example, in Fig. 3-18b, @ has a scalar
component a cos ¢ along the direction of b; note that a perpendicular dropped
from the head of @ onto b determines that component. Similarly, b has a scalar
component b cos ¢ along the direction of @.

& If the angle ¢ between two vectors is 0°, the component of one vector along the
other is maximum, and so also is the dot product of the vectors. If, instead, ¢ is 90°,
the component of one vector along the other is zero, and so is the dot product.

Equation 3-20 can be rewritten as follows to emphasize the components:

@-B = (acos 4)(b) = (a)(b cos 4). (3-21)
The commutative law applies to a scalar product, so we can write
Gb =b-a.

‘When two vectors are in unit-vector notation, we write their dot product as
G@-b=(ai taj t+ak)-(bi + bj + bh, (3-22)

which we can expand according to the distributive law: Each vector component
of the first vector is to be dotted with each vector component of the second vec-
tor. By doing so, we can show that

@-b = a,b, + a,by + a,b... (3-23)
