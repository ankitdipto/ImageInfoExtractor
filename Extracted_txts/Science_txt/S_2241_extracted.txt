CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

lv] Checkpoint 4

Vectors C and D have magnitudes of 3 units and 4 units, respectively. What is the
angle between the directions of C and D if C- D equals (a) zero, (b) 12 units, and
(c) -12 units?

The Vector Product

The vector product of @ and , written @ x b, produces a third vector ¢ whose
magnitude is

c=absin 4, (3-24)

where ¢ is the smaller of the two angles between @ and Bb. (You must use the
smaller of the two angles between the vectors because sin ¢ and sin(360° — )
differ in algebraic sign.) Because of the notation, @ x B is also known as the cross
product, and in speech it is “a cross b.”

oO If @ and B are parallel or antiparallel, @ x 6 =0. The magnitude of @ x 6, which can
be written as {@ x bl, is maximum when @ and b are perpendicular to each other.

The direction of ¢ is perpendicular to the plane that contains @ and BD.
Figure 3-19a shows how to determine the direction of € =@ X D with what is
known as a right-hand rule. Place the vectors @ and B tail to tail without altering
their orientations, and imagine a line that is perpendicular to their plane where
they meet. Pretend to place your right hand around that line in such a way that
your fingers would sweep @ into D through the smaller angle between them. Your
outstretched thumb points in the direction of ¢.

The order of the vector multiplication i is important. In Fig. 3-19b, we are
determining the direction of @’= b x @, so the fingers are placed to sweep b
into @ through the smaller angle. The thumb ends up in the opposite direction
from previously, and so it must be that ¢’ = —C; that is,

bx @=-(@x b). (3-25)

In other words, the commutative law does not apply to a vector product.
In unit-vector notation, we write

@XB=(ai taj tak) xX (bi +byj +b-k), (3-26)

which can be expanded according to the distributive law; that is, each component
of the first vector is to be crossed with each component of the second vector. The
cross products of unit vectors are given in Appendix E (see “Products of
Vectors”). For example, in the expansion of Eq. 3-26, we have

aa X bi = a,b, X i) = 0.
because the two unit vectors i and i are parallel and thus have a zero cross prod-
uct. Similarly, we have
aa X b,j =a,by(i Xj) = aybyk.
In the last step we used Eq. 3-24 to evaluate the magnitude of i Xj as unity.
(These vectors i and j each have a magnitude of unity, and the angle between

them is 90°.) Also, we used the right-hand rule to get the direction of i x j as
being in the positive direction of the z axis (thus in the direction of k).
