3-3 MULTIPLYING VECTORS 53

Continuing to expand Eq. 3-26, you can show that
@X DB = (aybz — byaz)i + (azby — bzay)j + (axby — bay). (3-27)

A determinant (Appendix E) or a vector-capable calculator can also be used.

To check whether any xyz coordinate system is a right-handed coordinate
system, use the right-hand rule for the cross product i x j = k with that system. If
your fingers sweep i (positive direction of x) into j (positive direction of y) with
the outstretched thumb pointing in the positive direction of z (not the negative
direction), then the system is right-handed.

Iv] Checkpoint § 5

Vectors Cand D have magnitudes of 3 units and 4 units, respectively. What is the an—_
gle between the directions of Cand D if the magnitude of the vector product C x D
is (a) zero and (b) 12 units?

Figure 3-19 Illustration of the right-hand rule for vector products. (a) Sweep vector @ into vector B with the fingers of your right hand.
Your outstretched thumb shows the direction of vector = @ X b. (b) Showing that b X @ is the reverse of a Xb.
