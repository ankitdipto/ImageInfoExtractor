54 CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

Sample Problem 3.05 Angle between two vectors using dot products

What is the angle ¢ between @ = 3.0i — 4.0) and b=
—2.0i + 3.0k? (Caution: Although many of the following
steps can be bypassed with a vector-capable calculator, you
will learn more about scalar products if, at least here, you
use these steps.)

KEY IDEA

 

The angle between the directions of two vectors is included
in the definition of their scalar product (Eq. 3-20):

G-D =abcos (3-28)
Calculations: In Eq. 3-28, a is the magnitude of @, or
a=V3.0 + (—4.0P = 5.00, (3-29)
and D is the magnitude of D, or
b= V2.0)? + 3.0? = 3.61. (3-30)

‘We can separately evaluate the left side of Eq. 3-28 by
writing the vectors in unit-vector notation and using the
distributive law:
@-D = (3.01 — 4.0}) -(—2.01 + 3.0k)
= (3.01) «(—2.03) + (3.01) «(3.0k)
+ (—4.0}) «(—2.02) + (—4.0}) «(3.0k).
‘We next apply Eq. 3-20 to each term in this last expression.

The angle between the unit vectors in the first term (i and 1) is
0°, and in the other terms it is 90°. We then have

A+B = ~(6.0)(1) + (9.0)(0) + (8.0)(0) ~ (12)(0)
= 6.0.
Substituting this result and the results of Eqs. 3-29 and 3-30
into Eq. 3-28 yields
—6.0 = (5.00)(3.61) cos 4,
—6.0

Sample Problem 3.06 Cross product, right-hand rule

In Fig. 3-20, vector @ lies in the xy plane, has a magnitude of
18 units, and points in a direction 250° from the positive di-
rection of the x axis. Also, vector B has a magnitude of
12 units and points in the positive direction of the z axis. What
is the vector product ¢ = @ x b?

KEY IDEA

 

‘When we have two vectors in magnitude-angle notation, we
find the magnitude of their cross product with Eq. 3-24 and
the direction of their cross product with the right-hand rule
of Fig. 3-19.

Calculations: For the magnitude we write
c= absin ¢ = (18)(12)(sin 90°) = 216.

To determine the direction in Fig. 3-20, imagine placing the

fingers of your right hand around a line perpendicular to the

plane of @ and b (the line on which ¢ is shown) such that
your fingers sweep @ into b. Your outstretched thumb then

(Answer)

Sweep @into b.

  
  

This is the resulting
vector, perpendicular to
both @and B.

y
Figure 3-20 Vector ¢ (in the xy plane) is the vector (or cross)
product of vectors @ and b.

gives the direction of ¢.Thus, as shown in the figure, € lies in
the xy plane. Because its direction is perpendicular to the
direction of @ (a cross product always gives a perpendicular
vector), it is at an angle of

250° — 90° = 160° (Answer)

from the positive direction of the x axis.

Sample Problem 3.07 Cross product, unit-vector notation

Ifa = 31 — 4j and b = —2i + 3k, whatis¢ = @ Xb?

KEY IDEA

 

When two vectors are in unit-vector notation, we can find
their cross product by using the distributive law.

Calculations: Here we write
€ = (31 — 4j) x (-2i + 3k)
= 31 X (—2i) + 31 x 3k + (—4) x (-2i)
+ (-4j) x 3k.
