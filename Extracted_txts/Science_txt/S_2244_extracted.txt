‘We next evaluate each term with Eq. 3-24, finding the
direction with the right-hand rule. For the first term here,
the angle @ between the two vectors being crossed is 0. For
the other terms, is 90°. We find

—6(0) + 9(—j) + 8(-k) — 121
—12i — 9j — 8k.

REVIEW & SUMMARY 55

This vector @ is perpendicular to both @ and b, a fact you
can check by showing that ¢:@ =0 and b= 0; that is, there
is no component of ¢ along the direction of either @ or Bb.

In general: A cross product gives a perpendicular
vector, two perpendicular vectors have a zero dot prod-
uct, and two vectors along the same axis have a zero
cross product.

Review & Summary

Scalars and Vectors Scalars, such as temperature, have magni-
tude only. They are specified by a number with a unit (10°C) and
obey the rules of arithmetic and ordinary algebra. Vectors, such as
displacement, have both magnitude and direction (5 m, north) and
obey the rules of vector algebra.

Adding Vectors Geometrically Two vectors @ and B may
be added geometrically by drawing them to a common scale
and placing them head to tail. The vector connecting the tail of
the first to the head of the second is the vector sums. To

subtract B from @, reverse the direction of b to get —b: then
add —5 to @. Vector addition is commutative
G+b=b+@ (3-2)
and obeys the associative law
(@+b)+¢=G+(6+%. (3-3)

Components of a Vector The (scalar) components a, and a, of
any two-dimensional vector @ along the coordinate axes are found
by dropping perpendicular lines from the ends of @ onto the coor-
dinate axes. The components are given by

 

 

a,=acos@ and a,=asin@, (3-5)

where @is the angle between the positive direction of the x axis
and the direction of @. The algebraic sign of a component indi-
cates its direction along the associated axis. Given its compo-
nents, we can find the magnitude and orientation (direction) of
the vector @ by using

4
a=Vaz+a> and tang=—
4,

(3-6)

Unit-Vector Notation Unit vectors i,j, and k have magnitudes of
unity and are directed in the positive directions of the x, y, and z
axes, respectively, in a right-handed coordinate system (as defined
by the vector products of the unit vectors). We can write a vector @
in terms of unit vectors as

G@=aita,) +a.k, (3-7)

in which a,i,a,j,and a,k are the vector components of @ and a,.4,,
and a, are its scalar components.

Adding Vectors in Component Form To add vectors in com-
ponent form, we use the rules

r=atbh, 1, =a,+b,

 

a,+b.. (3-10to3-12)

Here @ and B are the vectors to be added, and 7 is the vector sum.
Note that we add components axis by axis. We can then express the
sum in unit-vector notation or magnitude-angle notation.

Product of a Scalar and a Vector The product of a scalar sand
a vector V is a new vector whose magnitude is sv and whose direc-
tion is the same as that of ¥ if s is positive, and opposite that of V if
sis negative. (The negative sign reverses the vector.) To divide V by
s,multiply ¥ by 1s.

The Scalar Product The scalar (or dot) product of two vectors a
and B is written @-B and is the scalar quantity given by

GB =abcos 4 (3-20)

in which is the angle between the directions of @ and B.A scalar
product is the product of the magnitude of one vector and the
scalar component of the second vector along the direction of the
first vector. Note that @-b =6-@, which means that the scalar
product obeys the commutative law.

In unit-vector notation,

Gb =(ai+a,j +ak)-(b,i+b,j +.4), (3-22)

which may be expanded according to the distributive law.
The Vector Product The vector (or cross) product of two vectors
@ and b is written @ X b and is a vector € whose magnitude c is

given by
=ab sin 4,

 

(3-24)

in which ¢ is the smaller of the angles between the directions of @
and b. The direction of @ is perpendicular to the plane
defined by @ and B and is given by a right-hand rule, as shown in
Fig. 3-19. Note that @ x b= -( X@), which means that the vec-
tor product does not obey the commutative law.
In unit-vector notation,
@x 6b =(a,i +a,j +a.k) x (bi +b,j +b.k), (3-26)

which we may expand with the distributive law.
