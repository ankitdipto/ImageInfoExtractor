56 CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

<Questions

1 Can the sum of the magnitudes d
of two vectors ever be equal to the
magnitude of the sum of the same
two vectors? If no, why not? If yes, 4,
when?

2. The two vectors shown in Fig. 3-21
lie in an xy plane. What are the signs

of the x and_y components, respec- a
tively, of (a) di + d;, (b) d — db, and ‘
(od - a?

Figure 3-21 Question 2.
3 Being part of the “Gators,” the

University of Florida golfing team
must play on a putting green with an
alligator pit. Figure 3-22 shows an
overhead view of one putting chal-
lenge of the team; an xy coordinate
system is superimposed. Team mem-
bers must putt from the origin to the
hole, which is at xy coordinates (8 m,
12 m), but they can putt the golf ball
using only one or more of the fol-
lowing displacements, one or more
times:

d, = (8m)i+ (6m)j,
The pit is at coordinates (8 m, 6 m). If a team member putts the
ball into or through the pit, the member is automatically trans-
ferred to Florida State University, the arch rival. What sequence

of displacements should a team member use to avoid the pit and
the school transfer?

d= 6mj, d= (8m).

4 Equation 3-2 shows that the addition of two vectors @ and B is
commutative. Does that mean subtraction is commutative, so that
a-b=b-@

5 Which of the arrangements of axes in Fig. 3-23 can be labeled
“right-handed coordinate system”? As usual, each axis label indi-
cates the positive side of the axis.

6 Describe two vectors @ and B such that

(a)@+b=@ and at+b=c;

(b)@+b=a-5;

()@+b=¢ and € +B =e.

7 Id=a+b + (—€), does (a) d+ (—d) = ¢ + (-b), (b) d=
(—b) + d+ Zand (0) @ + (-d) =a +B?

8 Ifa-b =@-C, must B equal ¢?

 

 

9 If F=q(v x B) and ¥ is perpendicular to B, then what is the
direction of B in the three situations shown in Fig. 3-24 when con-
stant q is (a) positive and (b) negative?

10 Figure 3-25 shows vector A and
four other vectors that have the same
magnitude but differ in orientation.
(a) Which of those other four vectors
have the same dot product with A? (b)
Which have a negative dot product
with A?

 

11 In a game held within a three-
dimensional maze, you must move
your game piece from start, at xyz co-
ordinates (0,0, 0), to finish, at coordinates (—2 cm, 4 cm, —4 cm).
The game piece can undergo only the displacements (in centime-
ters) given below. If, along the way, the game piece lands at coordi-
nates (—5 cm, —1 cm, 1 em) or (5 cm, 2 cm, ~1 cm), you lose the
game. Which displacements and in what sequence will get your
game piece to finish?

12 Thexand y components of four vectors @ ,b ,@, and d are given
below. For which vectors will your calculator give you the correct an-

gle @when you use it to find @ with Eq. 3-6? Answer first by examin-
ing Fig. 3-12, and then check your answers with your calculator.

a,=3
b= -3

a=3  G=-3 G=73
b=3 dy=3 d,=-3.

13 Which of the following are correct (meaningful) vector
expressions? What is wrong with any incorrect expression?
