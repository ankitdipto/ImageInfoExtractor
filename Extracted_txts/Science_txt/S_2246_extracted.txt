pected storm blows the ship to a point 100 km due east of its
starting point. (a) How far and (b) in what direction must it now
sail to reach its original destination?

°12 Acar is driven east for a distance of 50 km, then north for 30
km, and then in a direction 30° east of north for 25 km. Sketch the
vector diagram and determine (a) the magnitude and (b) the angle
of the car’s total displacement from its starting point.

present location and in a direction that is 35.0° north of east.
However, she must travel along streets that are oriented either
north-south or east-west. What is the minimum distance she
could travel to reach her destination?

floor, starting at the origin of an xy coordinate system and ending
at the xy coordinates (—140 m, 30m). The x component and y
component of your moves are the following, respectively, in me-
ters: (20 and 60), then (b, and —70), then (—20 and c,), then (—60

itive direction of the x axis) of the overall displacement?

the centers of squares that are each 1.00 m on edge, a knight is
moved in the following way: (1) two squares forward, one square
rightward; (2) two squares leftward, one square forward; (3) two
squares forward, one square leftward. What are (a) the magnitude
