58 CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

+20 <8 An explorer is caught in a whiteout (in which the
snowfall is so thick that the ground cannot be distinguished from
the sky) while returning to base camp. He was supposed to travel
due north fo! km, but when the snow clears, he discovers that
he actually traveled 7.8 km at 50° north of due east. (a) How far
and (b) in what direction must he now travel to reach base camp?

 

21 © Anant, crazed by the Sun on a hot Texas afternoon, darts
over an xy plane scratched in the dirt. The x and y components of
four consecutive darts are the following, all in centimeters: (30.0,
40.0), (b,, 70.0), (20.0, c,), (—80.0, -70.0). The overall displace-
ment of the four darts has the xy components (— 140, —20.0). What
are (a) b, and (b) c,? What are the (c) magnitude and (d) angle
(relative to the positive direction of the x axis) of the overall
displacement?

°°22 (a) What is the sum of the following four vectors in unit-
vector notation? For that sum, what are (b) the magnitude, (c) the
angle in degrees, and (d) the angle in radians?

E: 6.00 mat +0.900 rad 5.00 mat —75.0°

B5
G: 4.00 mat +1.20rad_ 1: 6.00 m at —210°
23 If B is added to C = 3.01 + 4.0}, the result is a vector in the
positive direction of the y axis, with a magnitude equal to that of C.
What is the magnitude of B?

+24 ® Vector A, which is directed along an x axis, is to be added
to vector B, which has a magnitude of 7.0 m. The sum is a third vec-
tor that is directed along the y axis, with a magnitude that is 3.0
times that of A. What is that magnitude of A?

25 © Oasis B is 25 km due east of oasis A. Starting from oasis
A, a camel walks 24 km in a direction 15° south of east and then
walks 8.0 km due north. How far is the camel then from oasis B?

°°26 What is the sum of the following four vectors in (a) unit-
vector notation, and as (b) a magnitude and (c) an angle?

A = (2.00 m)i + (3.00 m)j

: 4.00 m, at +65.0°
C = (-4.00 m)i + (—6.00 m)j 5

B
D: 5.00 m, at —235°

27 © if d,+ d, = 5d;. d, — d, = 3dy, and d; = 21 + 4j, then
what are, in unit-vector notation, (a) d, and (b) a?

**28 Two beetles run across flat sand, starting at the same point.
Beetle 1 runs 0.50 m due east, then 0.80 m at 30° north of due east.
Beetle 2 also makes two runs; the first is 1.6 m at 40° east of due
north. What must be (a) the magnitude and (b) the direction of its
second run if it is to end up at the new location of beetle 1?

29 <= © Typical backyard ants often create a network of
chemical trails for guidance. Extending outward from the nest, a
trail branches (bifurcates) repeatedly, with 60° between the
branches. If a roaming ant chances upon a trail, it can tell the
way to the nest at any branch point: If it is moving away from
the nest, it has two choices of path requiring a small turn in
its travel direction, either 30° leftward or 30° rightward. If
it is moving toward the nest, it has only one such choice.
Figure 3-29 shows a typical ant trail, with lettered straight sec-
tions of 2.0 cm length and symmetric bifurcation of 60°. Path v is
parallel to the y axis. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) angle
(relative to the positive direction of the superimposed x axis) of

an ant’s displacement from the nest (find it in the figure) if the
ant enters the trail at point A? What are the (c) magnitude and
(d) angle ifit enters at point B?

30 @ Here are two vectors:

@ = (4.0m)i — (3.0m)j and 6 = (6.0m)i + (8.0m).

What are (a) the magnitude and (b) the angle (relative to 1) of @?
What are (c) the magnitude and (d) the angle of 6? What are (e)
the magnitude and (f) the angle of @ + 5; (g) the magnitude and
(h) the angle of b — @:and (i) the magnitude and (j) the angle of
a-b? (k) What is the angle between the directions of b-@
and@ — 5?

“31 In Fig. 3-30, a vector @ with a magnitude of 17.0 m is
directed at angle @ = 56.0° counterclockwise from the +x axis.
What are the components (a) a, and (b) a, of the vector? A sec-
ond coordinate system is inclined by angle 6’ = 18.0° with respect
to the first. What are the components (c) a, and (d) aj in this
primed coordinate system?

length a sits with one corner at the ori-
