60 CHAPTER 3 VECTORS

51 Rock faults are ruptures along which opposite faces of rock
have slid past each other. In Fig, 3-35, points A and B coincided be-
fore the rock in the foreground slid down to the right. The net dis-
placement AB is along the plane of the fault. The horizontal compo-
nent of AB is the strike-slip AC The component of AB that is
directed down the plane of the fault is the dip-slip AD. (a) What is the
magnitude of the net displacement AB if the strike-slip is22.0 m and
the dip-slip is 17.0 m? (b) If the plane of the fault is inclined at angle
= 52.0° to the horizontal, what is the vertical component of AB ?

of magnitude 6.0 units differ in directions by 60°. Find (a) the
scalar product of the two vectors and (b) the magnitude of the vec-
tor product @ x B.

late (a) @-5,(b) GC, and (c) b+ @.

55 A particle undergoes three successive displacements in a
plane, as follows: a. 4.00 m southwest; then a. 5.00 m east; and
finally d;, 6.00 m in a direction 60.0° north of east. Choose a coor-
dinate system with the y axis pointing north and the x axis pointing
east. What are (a) the x component and (b) the y component of d,?
What are (c) the x component and (d) the y component of a?
What are (e) the x component and (f) the y component of d;?
Next, consider the net displacement of the particle for the three
successive displacements. What are (g) the x component, (h) the y
component, (i) the magnitude, and (j) the direction of the net dis-
placement? If the particle is to return directly to the starting point,

system. Also, B = (12.0 m)i + (8.00 m)j on that same coordinate
system. We now rotate the system counterclockwise about the origin
by 20.0° to form an x'y’ system. On this new system, what are (a) A

up at the diagonally opposite corner. (a) What is the magnitude of
its displacement? (b) Could the length of its path be less than this
magnitude? (c) Greater? (d) Equal? (e) Choose a suitable coordi-
nate system and express the components of the displacement vec-

is the length of the shortest path? (Hint: This can be answered
without calculus. The room is like a box. Unfold its walls to flatten
them into a plane.)
