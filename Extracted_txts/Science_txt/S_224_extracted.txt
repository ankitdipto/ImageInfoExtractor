Alternation of generations. In sexual reproduction,
haploid cells or organisms alternate with diploid
cells or organisms.

Somatic Tissues. The life cycles of all sexually reproduc-
ing organisms follow the same basic pattern of alternation
between the diploid and haploid chromosome numbers
(figures 12.3 and 12.4). After fertilization, the resulting zy-
gote begins to divide by mitosis. This single diploid cell
eventually gives rise to all of the cells in the adult. These
cells are called somatic cells, from the Latin word for
“body.” Except when rare accidents occur, or in special
variation-creating situations such as occur in the immune
system, every one of the adult’s somatic cells is genetically
identical to the zygote.

In unicellular eukaryotic organisms, including most pro-
tists, individual cells function as gametes, fusing with other
gamete cells. The zygote may undergo mitosis, or it may
divide immediately by meiosis to give rise to haploid indi-
viduals. In plants, the haploid cells that meiosis produces
divide by mitosis, forming a multicellular haploid phase.
Certain cells of this haploid phase eventually differentiate
into eggs or sperm.

Germ-Line Tissues. In animals, the cells that will eventu-
ally undergo meiosis to produce gametes are set aside from
somatic cells early in the course of development. These cells
are often referred to as germ-line cells. Both the somatic
cells and the gamete-producing germ-line cells are diploid,
but while somatic cells undergo mitosis to form genetically
identical, diploid daughter cells, gamete-producing germ-
line cells undergo meiosis, producing haploid gametes.

 

Meiosis is a process of cell division in which the number
of chromosomes in certain cells is halved during gamete
formation. In the sexual life cycle, there is an
alternation of diploid and haploid generations.
