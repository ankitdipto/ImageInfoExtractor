67 Let i be directed to the east, j be directed to the north, and k
be directed upward, What are the values of products (a) i+ k, (b)
(—& - (-j), and (c) j - (=})? What are the directions (such as east
or down) of products (d) k x j,(e) (1) X (-}),and (f) (—k) x (=})?
68 A bank in downtown Boston is robbed (see the map in
Fig, 3-36). To elude police, the robbers escape by helicopter, mak-
ing three successive flights described by the following displace-
ments: 32 km, 45° south of east; 53 km,26° north of west;26 km, 18°
east of south. At the end of the third flight they are captured. In
what town are they apprehended?

69 A wheel witha radius of 45.0cm
rolls without slipping along a hori-
zontal floor (Fig, 3-37). At time f,,
the dot P painted on the rim of the
wheel is at the point of contact be-
tween the wheel and the floor. Ata
later time f;, the wheel has rolled
through one-half of a revolution.
What are (a) the magnitude and (b)
the angle (relative to the floor) of
the displacement of P?

70 A woman walks 250 m in the direction 30° east of north, then
175 mdirectly east. Find (a) the magnitude and (b) the angle of her
final displacement from the starting point. (c) Find the distance she
walks. (d) Which is greater, that distance or the magnitude of her
displacement?

71 Avector d has a magnitude 3.0 m and is directed south. What
are (a) the magnitude and (b) the direction of the vector 5.0d? What
are (c) the magnitude and (d) the direction of the vector —2.04?

PROBLEMS 61

72 A fire ant, searching for hot sauce in a picnic area, goes
through three displacements along level ground: dj for 0.40 m
southwest (that is, at 45° from directly south and from directly
west), d, for 0.50 m due east, d; for 0.60 m at 60° north of east.
Let the positive x direction be east and the positive y direction
be north. What are (a) the x component and (b) the y compo-
nent of d,? Next, what are (c) the x component and (d) the y
component of d;? Also, what are (e) the x component and (f)
the y component of d3?

What are (g) the x component, (h) the y component, (i) the
magnitude, and (j) the direction of the ant’s net displacement? If
the antis to return directly to the starting point, (k) how far and (1)
in what direction should it move?

73 Two vectors are given by @ = 3.01 + 5.0j and b = 2.01 + 4.0).
Find (a) @ x B, (b) 7-5, (c) (@ + B) +B, and (d) the component of
@ along the direction of b.

74 Vector @ lies in the yz plane 63.0° from the positive direction
of the y axis, has a positive z component, and has magnitude 3.20
units. Vector b lies in the xz plane 48.0° from the positive direction

of the x axis, has a positive z component, and has magnitude 1.40
units. Find (a) @ + b,(b) @ X b, and (c) the angle between @ and b.

75 Find (a) “north cross west,” (b) “down dot south,” (c) “east
cross up,” (d) “west dot west,” and (e) “south cross south.” Let each
“vector” have unit magnitude.

76 A vector B, with a magnitude of 8.0 m, is added to a vector A,
which lies along an x axis. The sum of these two vectors is a third
vector that lies along the y axis and has a magnitude that is twice
the magnitude of A. What is the magnitude of A?

77 A man goes for a walk, starting from the origin of an xyz
coordinate system, with the xy plane horizontal and the x axis east-
ward. Carrying a bad penny, he walks 1300 m east, 2200 m north,
and then drops the penny from a cliff 410 m high. (a) In unit-vector
notation, what is the displacement of the penny from start to its
landing point? (b) When the man returns to the origin, what is the
magnitude of his displacement for the return trip?

78 What is the magnitude of @ x (6 X @) if a = 3.90, b = 2.70,
and the angle between the two vectors is 63.0°?

79 In Fig, 3-38, the magnitude of @ is 4.3, the magnitude of B is
5.4, and ¢ = 46°. Find the area of the triangle contained between
the two vectors and the thin diagonal line.
