4-1 POSITION AND DISPLACEMENT 63

Position and Displacement

One general way of locating a particle (or particle-like object) is with a position
vector 7, which is a vector that extends from a reference point (usually the
origin) to the particle. In the unit-vector notation of Module 3-2, 7 can be written
Fax + yj + zk, (4-1)

where xy}. and zk are the vector components of F and the coefficients x, y,and z
are its scalar components.

The coefficients x, y, and z give the particle’s location along the coordinate
axes and relative to the origin; that is, the particle has the rectangular coordinates
(x,y, Z). For instance, Fig. 4-1 shows a particle with position vector

F =(-3m)i + (2m)j + (Sm)k
and rectangular coordinates (—3 m, 2 m, 5 m). Along the x axis the particle is
3 m from the origin, in the —i direction. Along the y axis it is 2m from the
origin, in the +] direction. Along the z axis it is 5 m from the origin, in the +k
direction.

Asa particle moves, its position vector changes in such a way that the vector
always extends to the particle from the reference point (the origin). If the posi-
tion vector changes—say, from 7, to 7, during a certain time interval—then the
particle’s displacement A7 during that time interval is

Ar = 7-7.

Using the unit-vector notation of Eq. 4-1, we can rewrite this displacement as

AP = (ai + yaj + zak) — (ri + aj + 21k)

oras Ar = (2 — mi + (2 — Wi + (@ — a)k, (43)
where coordinates (x), yi, Z;) correspond to position vector 7, and coordinates
(x2, ¥2, Z2) correspond to position vector 7. We can also rewrite the displacement

by substituting Ax for (x. — x1), Ay for (y2 — y;),and Az for (z) — z4):

This is how far

Figure 4-1 The position vector F for a parti-
cle is the vector sum of its vector compo-
nents.

Sample Problem 4.01 Two-dimensional position vector, rabbit run

A rabbit runs across a parking lot on which a set of
coordinate axes has, strangely enough, been drawn. The co-
ordinates (meters) of the rabbit’s position as functions of
time ¢ (seconds) are given by

0.310? + 7.2t + 28
.221? — 9.1t + 30.

KEY IDEA

The x and y coordinates of the rabbit’s position, as given by
Eggs. 4-5 and 4-6, are the scalar components of the rabbit’s

position vector 7. Let’s evaluate those coordinates at the
given time, and then we can use Eq. 3-6 to evaluate the mag-
nitude and orientation of the position vector.

Calculations: We can write

F(D) = x(Oi + yO). (47)
(We write 7(‘) rather than F because the components are
functions of t, and thus 7 is also.)
Att= 15s the scalar components are

x = (—0.31)(15)? + (7.2)(15) + 28 = 66 m
andy = (0.22)(15)? — (9.1)(15) + 30 = —57_m,

so F = (66m)i — (57 m)j, (Answer)
