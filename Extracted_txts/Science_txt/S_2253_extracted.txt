which is drawn in Fig. 4-2a. To get the magnitude and angle
of F, notice that the components form the legs of a right tri-
angle and r is the hypotenuse. So, we use Eq. 3-6:

r= V+ y= V(66 my? + (—57 m)?

= 87m, (Answer)

and 9 = tan? =

—41°. (Answer)

 

;— To locate the
rabbit, this is the
x component.

This is the y component.

This is the path with
various times indicated.

Check: Although @ = 139° has the same tangent as —41°,
the components of position vector 7 indicate that the de-
sired angle is 139° — 180° = —41°.

(b) Graph the rabbit’s path fort = 0 tot = 25s.

Graphing: We have located the rabbit at one instant, but to
see its path we need a graph. So we repeat part (a) for sev-
eral values of t and then plot the results. Figure 4-2b shows
the plots for six values of t and the path connecting them.

4-2 AVERAGE VELOCITY AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY

Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to...

4.04 Identify that velocity is a vector quantity and thus has
both magnitude and direction and also has components.

4.05 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional velocity
vectors for a particle, indicating the components along the
axes of the coordinate system.

Key Ideas

 

4.06 In magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations, relate a parti-
cle's initial and final position vectors, the time interval between
those positions, and the particle's average velocity vector.

4.07 Given a particle's position vector as a function of time,
determine its (instantaneous) velocity vector.

 

@ If a particle undergoes a displacement A7 in time interval At,
its average velocity Vig for that time interval is
= AF
Vayg =
NS At

@ As Atis shrunk to 0, Ving reaches a limit called either the
velocity or the instantaneous velocity V:

dr

dt?

v=

which can be rewritten in unit-vector notation as
Vevatyjt vk,

where v, = dx/dt, v, = dy/dt, andv, = dz/dt.

@ The instantaneous velocity V of a particle is always directed

along the tangent to the particle's path at the particle's
position.
