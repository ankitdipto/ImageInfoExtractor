4-2 AVERAGE VELOCITY AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY 65

Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity

Ifa particle moves from one point to another, we might need to know how fast it
moves. Just as in Chapter 2, we can define two quantities that deal with “how
fast”: average velocity and instantaneous velocity. However, here we must con-
sider these quantities as vectors and use vector notation.

If a particle moves through a displacement AF in a time interval Av, then its
average velocity V,,, is
displacement

average velocity = ——— 5
8 ° time interval

= Ar
or Vag = Ap (4-8)
This tells us that the direction of Vy. (the vector on the left side of Eq. 4-8) must
be the same as that of the displacement AF (the vector on the right side). Using
Eg. 4-4, we can write Eq. 4-8 in vector components as

 

 

Axi + Ayj + Ack _ Ay; Azs
Vag = At = + ar! + at k. (4-9)

 

For example, if a particle moves through displacement (12 m)i + (3.0m)k in
2.0 s, then its average velocity during that move is

7 _ AF _ (12m) + B.0m)k
we At 2.0s

That is, the average velocity (a vector quantity) has a component of 6.0 m/s along
the x axis and a component of 1.5 m/s along the z axis.

When we speak of the velocity of a particle, we usually mean the particle’s
instantaneous velocity V at some instant. This V is the value that Vy, approaches
in the limit as we shrink the time interval Af to 0 about that instant. Using the lan-
guage of calculus, we may write V as the derivative

= (6.0 m/s)i + (1.5 m/s)k.

Figure 4-3 shows the path of a particle that is restricted to the xy plane. As
the particle travels to the right along the curve, its position vector sweeps to the
right. During time interval At, the position vector changes from 7; to 7) and the
particle’s displacement is AV.

To find the instantaneous velocity of the particle at, say, instant ¢, (when the
particle is at position 1), we shrink interval Af to 0 about ;. Three things happen
as we do so. (1) Position vector 73 in Fig. 4-3 moves toward 7; so that AF shrinks

As the particle moves,
the position vector
must change.
