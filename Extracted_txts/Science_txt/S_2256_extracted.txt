4-3 AVERAGE ACCELERATION AND INSTANTANEOUS ACCELERATION 67

Sample Problem 4.02 Two-dimensional velocity, rabbit run

For the rabbit in the preceding sample problem, find the
velocity V at timet = 15s.

KEY IDEA

 

We can find V by taking derivatives of the components of
the rabbit’s position vector.

Calculations: Applying the v, part of Eq. 4-12 to Eq. 4-5,
we find the x component of V to be

= _ 4  osp
Vp = “Ge = op (O31? + 7.2t + 28)
= -0.62t + 7.2. (4-13)

At t= 15s, this gives v, = —2.1 m/s. Similarly, applying the
vy part of Eq. 4-12 to Eq. 4-6, we find

dy d
Vy = “Gp = agp (0.2207 — 9.1 + 30)
= 0.44t — 9.1. (4-14)

At t= 15s, this gives vy, = —2.5 m/s. Equation 4-11 then yields
¥ = (-2.1m/s)i + (-2.5 m/s)j, (Answer)

which is shown in Fig. 4-5, tangent to the rabbit’s path and in
the direction the rabbit is running att = 15s.

To get the magnitude and angle of V, either we use a
vector-capable calculator or we follow Eq. 3-6 to write

enue

v= Vv + v3 = V(-2.1 m/s)? + (—2.5 m/s)?

   

= 3.3 m/s (Answer)
yy —2.5 m/s

Check: Is the angle —130° or —130° + 180° = 50°?

y(m)

These are the x and y
components of the vector
at this instant.
