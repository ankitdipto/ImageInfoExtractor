CHAPTER 4 MOTION IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS

Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration

When a particle’s velocity changes from Vj to V2 in a time interval Ar, its average

If we shrink At to zero about some instant, then in the limit Gy approaches the
instantaneous acceleration (or acceleration) @ at that instant; that is,

If the velocity changes in either magnitude or direction (or both), the particle
must have an acceleration.
We can write Eq. 4-16 in unit-vector form by substituting Eq. 4-11 for V to obtain

To find the scalar components of @, we differentiate the scalar components of V.
Figure 4-6 shows an acceleration vector @ and its scalar components for a
particle moving in two dimensions. Caution: When an acceleration vector is
drawn, as in Fig. 4-6, it does not extend from one position to another. Rather, it
shows the direction of acceleration for a particle located at its tail, and its length
(representing the acceleration magnitude) can be drawn to any scale.

These are the x and y
components of the vector
