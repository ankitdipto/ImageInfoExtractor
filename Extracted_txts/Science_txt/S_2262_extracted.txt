As is illustrated in Fig. 4-9 and Eq. 4-23, the vertical velocity component be-
haves just as for a ball thrown vertically upward. It is directed upward initially,
and its magnitude steadily decreases to zero, which marks the maximum height of
the path. The vertical velocity component then reverses direction, and its magni-
tude becomes larger with time.

The Equation of the Path

We can find the equation of the projectile’s path (its trajectory) by eliminating
time ¢ between Egs. 4-21 and 4-22. Solving Eq. 4-21 for ¢ and substituting into
Eq. 4-22, we obtain, after a little rearrangement,

gx?

= (t _—_ 8s
y = (tan 6))x 2(vp cos 6)?

(trajectory). (4-25)
This is the equation of the path shown in Fig. 4-9. In deriving it, for simplicity we
let x9 = 0 and yo = 0 in Eqs. 4-21 and 4-22, respectively. Because g, 9, and vo are
constants, Eq. 4-25 is of the form y = ax + bx?, in which a and b are constants.
This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic.

The Horizontal Range
The horizontal range R of the projectile is the horizontal distance the projectile
has traveled when it returns to its initial height (the height at which it is
launched). To find range R, let us put x — x9 = R in Eq. 4-21 and y — yp = 0 in
Eq. 4-22, obtaining

R = (vocos &)t

and 0 = (vpsin &)t — 580.

Eliminating t between these two equations yields

R= 20 in 9 COS Op.

Using the identity sin 2 @ = 2 sin % cos @ (see Appendix E), we obtain
ve.
R= — sin 26. (4-26)

This equation does not give the horizontal distance traveled by a projectile when

the final height is not the launch height. Note that R in Eq. 4-26 has its maximum
value when sin 2 = 1, which corresponds to 2 @) = 90° or @ = 45°.

Oe)

However, when the launch and landing heights differ, as in many sports, a launch
angle of 45° does not yield the maximum horizontal distance.

The horizontal range R is maximum for a launch angle of 45°.

The Effects of the Air

‘We have assumed that the air through which the projectile moves has no effect
on its motion. However, in many situations, the disagreement between our calcu-
lations and the actual motion of the projectile can be large because the air resists
(opposes) the motion. Figure 4-13, for example, shows two paths for a fly ball that
leaves the bat at an angle of 60° with the horizontal and an initial speed of
44.7 m/s. Path I (the baseball player's fly ball) is a calculated path that
approximates normal conditions of play, in air. Path II (the physics professor’s fly
ball) is the path the ball would follow in a vacuum.
