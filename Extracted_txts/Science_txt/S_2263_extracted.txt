lv] Checkpoint 4

A fly ball is hit to the outfield. During its flight (ignore the effects of the air), what
happens to its (a) horizontal and (b) vertical components of velocity? What are the (c)
horizontal and (d) vertical components of its acceleration during ascent, during de-
scent, and at the topmost point of its flight?

Sample Problem 4.04 Projectile dropped from airplane

In Fig. 4-14, a rescue plane flies at 198 km/h (= 55.0 m/s) and
constant height h = 500 m toward a point directly over a
victim, where a rescue capsule is to land.

(a) What should be the angle ¢ of the pilot’s line of sight to
the victim when the capsule release is made?

KEY IDEAS

Once released, the capsule is a projectile, so its horizontal
and vertical motions can be considered separately (we need
not consider the actual curved path of the capsule).

Calculations: In Fig. 4-14, we see that dis given by
6 = tan! a (4-27)

where x is the horizontal coordinate of the victim (and of
the capsule when it hits the water) and h = 500 m. We
should be able to find x with Eq. 4-21:

X — Xp = (Vo cos H)t. (4-28)

Here we know that xp = 0 because the origin is placed at
the point of release. Because the capsule is released and
not shot from the plane, its initial velocity Vp is equal to
the plane’s velocity. Thus, we know also that the initial ve-
locity has magnitude vp = 55.0 m/s and angle @ = 0°
(measured relative to the positive direction of the x axis).
However, we do not know the time f the capsule takes to
move from the plane to the victim.

To find ¢, we next consider the vertical motion and
specifically Eq. 4-22:

¥ — Yo = (vosin )t — 3g0?. (4-29)

Here the vertical displacement y — yo of the capsule is
—500m (the negative value indicates that the capsule
moves downward). So,

—500 m = (55.0 m/s)(sin 0°) — 4(9.8 m/s2y2,—_ (4-30)

Solving for t, we find t = 10.1 s. Using that value in Eq. 4-28
yields
x — 0 = (55.0 m/s)(cos 0°)(10.1 s),

or x =555.5m.

Figure 4-14 A plane drops a rescue capsule while moving at
constant velocity in level flight. While falling, the capsule
remains under the plane.

Then Eq. 4-27 gives us

1 555.5 m
500m
(b) As the capsule reaches the water, what is its velocity ¥ ?

o = tan™ = 48.0°. (Answer)

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The horizontal and vertical components of the capsule’s
velocity are independent. (2) Component v, does not change
from its initial value vo, = vp cos @ because there is no hori-
zontal acceleration. (3) Component v, changes from its initial
value Voy = Vo Sin @ because there is a vertical acceleration.

Calculations: When the capsule reaches the water,
Vy = Vo COS 6 = (55.0 m/s)(cos 0°) = 55.0 m/s.
Using Eq. 4-23 and the capsule’s time of fall t = 10.1 s, we
also find that when the capsule reaches the water,
Vy = Vosin @ — gt
= (55.0 m/s)(sin 0°) — (9.8 m/s?)(10.1 s)
= —99.0 m/s.
Thus, at the water
V = (55.0 m/s)i — (99.0 m/s)j. (Answer)
From Eq. 3-6, the magnitude and the angle of v are

v=113m/s and @=—60.9°. (Answer)
