4-4 PROJECTILE MOTION 75

Sample Problem 4.05 Launched into the air from a water slide

One of the most dramatic videos on the web (but entirely
fictitious) supposedly shows a man sliding along a long wa-
ter slide and then being launched into the air to land in a
water pool. Let’s attach some reasonable numbers to such
a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would
have hit the water. Figure 4-15a indicates the launch and
landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate sys-
tem with its origin conveniently located at the launch site.
From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as
D = 20.0 m, the flight time as ¢ = 2.50s, and the launch an-
gle as @ = 40.0°. Find the magnitude of the velocity at
launch and at landing.

KEY IDEAS

(1) For projectile motion, we can apply the equations for con-
stant acceleration along the horizontal and vertical axes sepa-
rately. (2) Throughout the flight, the vertical acceleration is
dy = —g = —9.8 m/s and the horizontal acceleration is a, = 0.

Calculations: In most projectile problems, the initial chal-
lenge is to figure out where to start. There is nothing wrong
with trying out various equations, to see if we can somehow
get to the velocities. But here is a clue. Because we are going
to apply the constant-acceleration equations separately to
the x and y motions, we should find the horizontal and verti-
cal components of the velocities at launch and at landing.
For each site, we can then combine the velocity components
to get the velocity.

Because we know the horizontal displacement D =
20.0 m, let’s start with the horizontal motion. Since a, = 0,

we know that the horizontal velocity component v, is con-
stant during the flight and thus is always equal to the hori-
zontal component vo, at launch. We can relate that compo-
nent, the displacement x — Xo, and the flight time t = 2.50 s
with Eq. 2-15:

X — Xp = Vost + 3ad?. (4-32)

Substituting a, = 0, this becomes Eq. 4-21. With x — x) = D,
we then write

20 m = vp,(2.50 s) + 5 (0)(2.50 s)?
Vor = 8.00 m/s.

That is a component of the launch velocity, but we need
the magnitude of the full vector, as shown in Fig. 4-15),
where the components form the legs of a right triangle and
the full vector forms the hypotenuse. We can then apply a
trig definition to find the magnitude of the full velocity at
launch:

and so

cos cos 40°
= 10.44 m/s ~ 10.4 m/s. (Answer)

Now let’s go after the magnitude v of the landing veloc-
ity. We already know the horizontal component, which does
not change from its initial value of 8.00 m/s. To find the verti-
cal component v, and because we know the elapsed time t =
2.50 s and the vertical acceleration a, = —9.8 m/s’, let’s
rewrite Eq. 2-11 as

Vy = Voy + ayt
and then (from Fig. 4-15)) as
Vy = Vy Sin A + ayt. (4-33)
Substituting a, = —g, this becomes Eq. 4-23. We can then write
vy = (10.44 m/s) sin (40.0°) — (9.8 m/s?)(2.50 s)
= —17.78 mis.

Now that we know both components of the landing velocity,
we use Eq. 3-6 to find the velocity magnitude:

v= V+ v3
= V(8.00 m/s)? + .78 m/s)?

= 19.49 m/s? ~ 19.5 mis. (Answer)
