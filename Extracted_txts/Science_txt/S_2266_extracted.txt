The scalar components of V are shown in Fig. 4-17b. With them, we can write

the velocity ¥ as

 

 

Vevd + yj

Now, using the right triangle in Fig. 4-17a, we can replace sin @ with y,/r and

cos @ with x,/r to write

ve (- 2 4 (2)
r r

To find the acceleration @ of particle p, we must take the time derivative of this
equation. Noting that speed v and radius r do not change with time, we obtain

(=v sin 6)1 + (v cos 6)j.

Now note that the rate dy,/dt at which y, changes is equal to the velocity Vy

component v,. Similarly, dx,/dt = v,, and, again from Fig. 4-17, we see that v, =

Thus, ¢= 0, which means that @ is directed along the radius r of Fig. 4-17a,

toward the circle’s center, as we wanted to prove.

lv] Checkpoint 5

An object moves at constant speed along a circular path in a horizontal xy plane, with
the center at the origin. When the object is at x = —2 m, its velocity is —(4 m/s)}. Give

the object’s (a) velocity and (b) acceleration at y = 2m.

Sample Problem 4.06 Top gun pilots in turns

“Top gun” pilots have long worried about taking a turn too
tightly. As a pilot’s body undergoes centripetal acceleration,
with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pres-
sure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.

There are several warning signs. When the centripetal
acceleration is 2g or 3g, the pilot feels heavy. At about 4g,
the pilot’s vision switches to black and white and narrows to
“tunnel vision.” If that acceleration is sustained or in-
creased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is uncon-
scious—a condition known as g-LOC for “g-induced loss of
consciousness.”

What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units, of
a pilot whose aircraft enters a horizontal circular turn with a
velocity of V; = (400i + 500}) m/s and 24.0 s later leaves the
turn with a velocity of V, = (—400i — 500}) m/s?

KEY IDEAS

We assume the turn is made with uniform circular motion.
Then the pilot’s acceleration is centripetal and has magni-
tude a given by Eq. 4-34 (a = v’/R), where R is the circle’s
radius. Also, the time required to complete a full circle is the
period given by Eq. 4-35 (T = 27Riv). =
Calculations: Because we do not know radius R, let’s solve
Eq. 4-35 for R and substitute into Eq. 4-34. We find
_ 2av
a=

To get the constant speed y, let’s substitute the components
of the initial velocity into Eq. 3-6:

v = V (400 m/s)? + (500 m/s)? = 640.31 mis.
