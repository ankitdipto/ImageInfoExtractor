4-6 RELATIVE MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION 79

velocity vpz of P as measured by B plus the velocity vg, of B as measured by A.”

The term vg, is the velocity of frame B relative to frame A.

Here we consider only frames that move at constant velocity relative to
each other. In our example, this means that Barbara (frame B) drives always at
constant velocity vg, relative to Alex (frame A). Car P (the moving particle),
however, can change speed and direction (that is, it can accelerate).

To relate an acceleration of P as measured by Barbara and by Alex, we take

the time derivative of Eq. 4-41:

d d d
a (era) = ap (ven) + Gp (YBa):

Because vg, is constant, the last term is zero and we have

pa = App.

In other words,

x] Observers on different frames of reference that move at constant velocity relative
to each other will measure the same acceleration for a moving particle.

Sample Problem 4.07 Relative motion, one dimensional, Alex and Barbara

In Fig. 4-18, suppose that Barbara’s velocity relative to Alex
isa constant vg, = 52 km/h and car P is moving in the nega-
tive direction of the x axis.

(a) If Alex measures a constant vp, = —78 km/h for car P,
what velocity vpg will Barbara measure?

KEY IDEAS

 

We can attach a frame of reference A to Alex and a frame of
reference B to Barbara. Because the frames move at constant
velocity relative to each other along one axis, we can use
Eq. 4-41 (vp, = vpg + Vga) to relate vpg to vp4 and Vay.

Calculation: We find
—78 km/h = vpg + 52 km/h.
Vpg = —130 km/h.

Thus, (Answer)

Comment: If car P were connected to Barbara’s car by a
cord wound on a spool, the cord would be unwinding at
a speed of 130 km/h as the two cars separated.

(b) Ifcar P brakes to a stop relative to Alex (and thus rela-
tive to the ground) in time f = 10 s at constant acceleration,
what is its acceleration ap, relative to Alex?

KEY IDEAS
To calculate the acceleration of car P relative to Alex, we
must use the car’s velocities relative to Alex. Because the

acceleration is constant, we can use Eq. 2-11 (v = vp + at)

to relate the acceleration to the initial and final velocities
of P.

Calculation: The initial velocity of P relative to Alex is
Vp, = —78 km/h and the final velocity is 0. Thus, the acceler-
ation relative to Alex is

v=vo _ 0 (-78km/h)

(c) What is the acceleration ap, of car P relative to Barbara
during the braking?

KEY IDEA

 

To calculate the acceleration of car P relative to Barbara, we
must use the car’s velocities relative to Barbara.

Calculation: We know the initial velocity of P relative to
Barbara from part (a) (vpg = —130 km/h). The final veloc-
ity of P relative to Barbara is —52 km/h (because this is
the velocity of the stopped car relative to the moving
Barbara). Thus,

_ vovM _ —52km/h —(-130km/h) 1 m/s

= 22 mis’. (Answer)

Comment: We should have foreseen this result: Because
Alex and Barbara have a constant relative velocity, they
must measure the same acceleration for the car.
