FIGURE 12.6

A comparison of meiosis and mitosis. Meiosis involves two nuclear divisions with no DNA replication between them. It thus produces
four daughter cells, each with half the original number of chromosomes. Crossing over occurs in prophase I of meiosis. Mitosis involves a
single nuclear division after DNA replication. It thus produces two daughter cells, each containing the original number of chromosomes.
