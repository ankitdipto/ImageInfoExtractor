This relation is written in vector notation as

velocity of wind

‘We need to resolve the vectors into components on the co-
ordinate system of Fig. 4-20b and then solve Eq. 4-46 axis by
axis. For the y components, we find

Vay = Vewy + Yway
or 0= —(215 km/h) sin @ + (65.0 km/h)(cos 20.0°).
Solving for @ gives us

a 215 km/h

= 165°. (Answer)

Similarly, for the x components we find

VPGx = Vews + Vwax
Here, because Vp, is parallel to the x axis, the component
VpG.x is equal to the magnitude vpg. Substituting this nota-
tion and the value @ = 16.5°, we find
vpg = (215 km/h)(cos 16.5°) + (65.0 km/h)(sin 20.0°)
= 228 km/h. (Answer)

Review & Summary

Position Vector The location of a particle relative to the ori-
gin of a coordinate system is given by a position vector F which in
unit-vector notation is

F =x t+ yj + zk. (4-1)

Here xis yj, and zk are the vector components of position vector F,
and x, y, and z are its scalar components (as well as the coordinates
of the particle). A position vector is described either by a magni-
tude and one or two angles for orientation, or by its vector or
scalar components.

Displacement If a particle moves so that its position vector
changes from F; to 7), the particle’s displacement AF is

AF =7- 7h. (42)

The displacement can also be written as
AF =) — i + Oy — Wi + @ — ek (43)
= Axi + Ayj + Azk. (4-4)

Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity If a parti-
cle undergoes a displacement A7 in time interval Af, its average ve-

locity Vy. for that time interval is

Vag = 4-8
we = (48)

As At in Eq. 4-8 is shrunk to 0, V,,, reaches a limit called either the
velocity or the instantaneous velocity V:

—_ dr
j= —, 4-10
va (4-10)
which can be rewritten in unit-vector notation as
Vevity,j + vk, (4-11)

where v, = dx/dt, v, = dy/dt, and v, = dz/dt. The instantaneous
velocity V of a particle is always directed along the tangent to the
particle’s path at the particle’s position.

Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration
If a particle’s velocity changes from YV, to V) in time interval Ar, its
average acceleration during At is
