Module 4-1 Position and Displacement

(3.0m)j + (2.0m)k. (a) Find the magnitude of F. (b) Sketch the
vector on a right-handed coordinate system.

tation and as (b) a magnitude and (c) an angle relative to the positive
direction of the x axis. (d) Sketch the vector on a right-handed coor-
dinate system. If the seed is moved to the xyz coordinates (3.00 m,
0 m, 0m), what is its displacement (e) in unit-vector notation and as
(f) a magnitude and (g) an angle relative to the positive x direction?
