At time ¢ = 0, the velocity is (4.00 m/s)i. What are the (a) magni-
tude and (b) angle of its velocity when it has been displaced by
12.0 m parallel to the x axis?

19 The acceleration of a particle moving only on a horizontal
xy plane is given by @ = 3¢i + 4), where @ is in meters per second-
squared and f is in seconds. At ¢=0, the position vector
F = (20.0 m)i + (40.0 m)j locates the particle, which then has the
velocity vector ¥ = (5.00 m/s)i + (2.00 m/s)j. At t = 4.00 s, what
are (a) its position vector in unit-vector notation and (b) the angle
between its direction of travel and the positive direction of the
X axis?

°21 A dart is thrown horizontally with an initial speed of
10 m/s toward point P, the bull’s-eye on a dart board. It hits at
point Q on the rim, vertically below P, 0.19 s later. (a) What is the
distance PQ? (b) How far away from the dart board is the dart
released?

+22 A small ball rolls horizontally off the edge of a tabletop that
is 1.20 m high. It strikes the floor at a point 1.52 m horizontally
from the table edge. (a) How long is the ball in the air? (b) What is
its speed at the instant it leaves the table?

23 A projectile is fired horizontally from a gun that is
45.0 m above flat ground, emerging from the gun with a speed of
250 m/s. (a) How long does the projectile remain in the air? (b) At
what horizontal distance from the firing point does it strike the
ground? (c) What is the magnitude of the vertical component of its
velocity as it strikes the ground?

°24 <%= In the 1991 World Track and Field Championships in
Tokyo, Mike Powell jumped 8.95 m, breaking by a full 5 cm the
23-year long-jump record set by Bob Beamon. Assume that
Powell’s speed on takeoff was 9.5 m/s (about equal to that of a
sprinter) and that g = 9.80 m/s? in Tokyo. How much less was
Powell's range than the maximum possible range for a particle
launched at the same speed?

+25 <= The current world-record motorcycle jump is 77.0 m,
set by Jason Renie. Assume that he left the take-off ramp at
12.0° to the horizontal and that the take-off and landing
heights are the same. Neglecting air drag, determine his take-off
speed.

°26 A stone is catapulted at time ¢ = 0, with an initial velocity of
magnitude 20.0 m/s and at an angle of 40.0° above the horizontal.
What are the magnitudes of the (a) horizontal and (b) vertical
components of its displacement from the catapult site at t = 1.10 s?
Repeat for the (c) horizontal and (d) vertical components at
80 s, and for the (e) horizontal and (f) vertical components at
.00 s.

27 1Lw A certain airplane has a
speed of 290.0 km/h and is diving
at an angle of @ = 30.0° below the
horizontal when the pilot releases
a radar decoy (Fig. 4-33). The hori-
zontal distance between the re-
lease point and the point where
the decoy strikes the ground is d =
700 m. (a) How long is the decoy in
the air? (b) How high was the re-
lease point?

jected at a cliff of height h with an initial speed of 42.0 m/s directed
at angle @ = 60.0° above the horizontal. The stone strikes at A,
5.50 after launching. Find (a) the height h of the cliff, (b) the
speed of the stone just before impact at A, and (c) the maximum
height Hreached above the ground.

speed of 19.5 m/s at an upward angle of 45°. A player 55 m away in
the direction of the kick starts running to meet the ball at that in-
stant. What must be his average speed if he is to meet the ball just
before it hits the ground?

31 <= Ina jump spike, a volleyball player slams the ball from
overhead and toward the opposite floor. Controlling the angle of
the spike is difficult. Suppose a ball is spiked from a height of 2.30
m with an initial speed of 20.0 nvs at a downward angle of 18.00°.
How much farther on the opposite floor would it have landed if the
downward angle were, instead, 8.00°?

wall at speed 25.0 m/s and at angle

ball. (a) How far above the release
point does the ball hit the wall?

it hits, has it passed the highest point on its trajectory?
