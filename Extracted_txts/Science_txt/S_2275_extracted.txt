wall because then arrows could reach it from the castle wall. Instead,
it was positioned so that the stone hit the wall during the second half
ofits flight. Suppose a stone is launched with a speed of vp = 28.0 m/s
and at an angle of @ = 40.0°. What is the speed of the stone if it hits
the wall (a) just as it reaches the top of its parabolic path and (b)
when it has descended to half that height? (c) As a percentage, how
much faster is it moving in part (b) than in part (a)?

*°35 SSM A rifle that shoots bullets at 460 m/s is to be aimed at
a target 45.7 m away. If the center of the target is level with the ri-
fle, how high above the target must the rifle barrel be pointed so
that the bullet hits dead center?

36 @ During a tennis match, a player serves the ball at
23.6 mvs, with the center of the ball leaving the racquet horizontally
2.37 m above the court surface. The net is 12 m away and 0.90 m
high. When the ball reaches the net, (a) does the ball clear it and
(b) what is the distance between the center of the ball and the top
of the net? Suppose that, instead, the ball is served as before but
now it leaves the racquet at 5.00° below the horizontal. When the
ball reaches the net, (c) does the ball clear it and (d) what now is
the distance between the center of the ball and the top of the net?

“37 SSM WWW A lowly high diver pushes off horizontally
with a speed of 2.00 m/s from the platform edge 10.0 m above the
surface of the water. (a) At what horizontal distance from the
edge is the diver 0.800 s after pushing off? (b) At what vertical
distance above the surface of the water is the diver just then?
(c) At what horizontal distance from the edge does the diver
strike the water?

ground level. The speed of
the golf ball as a function of
the time is shown in Fig. 4-36,
where ¢ = 0 at the instant the
ball is struck. The scaling on
the vertical axis is set by
v, = 19 m/s and v, = 31 mis. “oT
(a) How far does the golf
ball travel horizontally be-
fore returning to ground
level? (b) What is the maximum height above ground level at-
tained by the ball?

°°39 In Fig. 4-37, a ball is thrown leftward from the left edge of the
roof, at height / above the ground. The ball hits the ground 1.50 s
later, at distance d = 25.0 m from the building and at angle @ = 60.0°
with the horizontal. (a) Find h.
(Hint: One way is to reverse the
motion, as if on video.) What
are the (b) magnitude and (c)
angle relative to the horizontal
of the velocity at which the ball
is thrown? (d) Is the angle
above or below the horizontal?

°°40 <= Suppose that a shot putter can put a shot at the world-
class speed vp = 15.00 m/s and at a height of 2.160 m. What hori-
zontal distance would the shot travel if the launch angle @ is
(a) 45.00° and (b) 42.00°? The answers indicate that the angle of
45°, which maximizes the range of projectile motion, does not max-
imize the horizontal distance when the launch and landing are at
different heights.

 

41 © <¥= Upon spotting an in- Insect
sect on a twig overhanging water, an (Fon twig
archer fish squirts water drops at the ue

insect to knock it into the water “

(Fig. 4-38). Although the fish sees the o

insect along a straight-line path at an-
gle and distance d, a drop must be
launched at a different angle if its
parabolic path is to intersect the
insect. If ¢ = 36.0° and d = 0.900 m,
what launch angle @ is required for the drop to be at the top of the
parabolic path when it reaches the insect?

0°42 <%= In 1939 or 1940, Emanuel Zacchini took his human-
cannonball act to an extreme: After being shot from a cannon, he
soared over three Ferris wheels and into a net (Fig. 4-39). Assume
that he is launched with a speed of 26.5 m/s and at an angle of 53.0°.
(a) Treating him as a particle, calculate his clearance over the first
wheel. (b) If he reached maximum height over the middle wheel, by
how much did he clear it? (c) How far from the cannon should the
net’s center have been positioned (neglect air drag)?

43 IW A ball is shot from the ground into the air. At a height
of 9.1 m, its velocity is ¥ = (7.61 + 6.1}) m/s, with 1 horizontal and j
upward. (a) To what maximum height does the ball rise? (b) What
total horizontal distance does the ball travel? What are the
(c) magnitude and (d) angle (below the horizontal) of the ball’s ve-
locity just before it hits the ground?

44 A baseball leaves a pitcher’s hand horizontally at a speed of
161 knv/h. The distance to the batter is 18.3 m. (a) How long does the
ball take to travel the first half of that distance? (b) The second half?
(c) How far does the ball fall freely during the first half? (d) During
the second half? (e) Why aren’t the quantities in (c) and (d) equal?

“45 In Fig. 4-40, a ball is launched with a velocity of magnitude
10.0 m/s, at an angle of 50.0° to the horizontal. The launch point is at
the base of a ramp of horizon-
tal length d,=6.00m and
height d; = 3.60m. A plateau
is located at the top of the
ramp. (a) Does the ball land on
the ramp or the plateau? When
it lands, what are the (b) mag-
nitude and (c) angle of its dis-
placement from the launch point?
