95 Figure 4-53 shows the straight path of a particle B
across an xy coordinate system as the particle is ac-

celerated from rest during time interval Ar. The ac-
celeration is constant. The xy coordinates for point
A are (4.00 m, 6.00 m); those for point B are (12.0
m, 18.0 m). (a) What is the ratio a,/a, of the acceler-
ation components? (b) What are the coordinates of
the particle if the motion is continued for another

96 For women’s volleyball the top of the net is 2.24 m above the
floor and the court measures 9.0 m by 9.0 m on each side of the
net. Using a jump serve, a player strikes the ball at a point that is
3.0 m above the floor and a horizontal distance of 8.0 m from the
net. If the initial velocity of the ball is horizontal, (a) what mini-
mum magnitude must it have if the ball is to clear the net and (b)
what maximum magnitude can it have if the ball is to strike the
floor inside the back line on the other side of the net?

98 A particle isin uniform circular motion about the origin of an
xy coordinate system, moving clockwise with a period of 7.00 s. At
one instant, its position vector (measured from the origin) is

unit-vector notation?

100 An iceboat sails across the surface of a frozen lake with con-
stant acceleration produced by the wind. At a certain instant the
boat’s velocity is (6.301 — 8.42}) m/s. Three seconds later, because
of a wind shift, the boat is instantaneously at rest. What is its aver-
age acceleration for this 3.00 s interval?

v, = 3.00 m/s. What maximum height
does the ball reach relative to (a) the
ground and (b) the cab floor? At what rate does the speed of the ball
change relative to (c) the ground and (d) the cab floor?

an object on Earth’s equator due to the rotation of Earth? (b)
What would Earth’s rotation period have to be for objects on the
equator to have a centripetal acceleration of magnitude 9.8 m/s”?

112 <8 The range of a projectile depends not only on vy and 6
but also on the value g of the free-fall acceleration, which varies
from place to place. In 1936, Jesse Owens established a world’s
running broad jump record of 8.09 m at the Olympic Games at
Berlin (where g = 9.8128 nv/s2). Assuming the same values of vp
and 6), by how much would his record have differed if he had com-
peted instead in 1956 at Melbourne (where g = 9.7999 m/s?)?
