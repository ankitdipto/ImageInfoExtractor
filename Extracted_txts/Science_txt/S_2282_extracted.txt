128 The pilot of an aircraft flies due east relative to the ground
in a wind blowing 20.0 km/h toward the south. If the speed of the
aircraft in the absence of wind is 70.0 km/h, what is the speed of the
aircraft relative to the ground?

129 The pitcher ina slow-pitch softball game releases the ball at a
point 3.0 ft above ground level. A stroboscopic plot of the position of
the ball is shown in Fig, 4-60, where the readings are 0.25 s apart and
the ball is released at t = 0. (a) What is the initial speed of the ball?
(b) What is the speed of the ball at the instant it reaches its maxi-
mum height above ground level? (c) What is that maximum height?

130 Some state trooper departments use aircraft to enforce
highway speed limits. Suppose that one of the airplanes has a speed
of 135 mi/h in still air. It is flying straight north so that it is at all
times directly above a north-south highway. A ground observer
tells the pilot by radio that a 70.0 mi/h wind is blowing but neglects
to give the wind direction. The pilot observes that in spite of the
wind the plane can travel 135 mi along the highway in 1.00 h. In
other words, the ground speed is the same as if there were no wind.
(a) From what direction is the wind blowing? (b) What is the head-
ing of the plane; that is, in what direction does it point?

131 A golfer tees off from the top of a rise, giving the golf ball an
initial velocity of 43.0 m/s at an angle of 30.0° above the horizontal.
The ball strikes the fairway a horizontal distance of 180 m from the
tee. Assume the fairway is level. (a) How high is the rise above the
fairway? (b) What is the speed of the ball as it strikes the fairway?

132 A track meet is held on a planet in a distant solar system. A
shot-putter releases a shot at a point 2.0 m above ground level. A
stroboscopic plot of the position of the shot is shown in Fig. 4-61,

where the readings are 0.50 s apart and the shot is released at
time t = 0. (a) What is the initial velocity of the shot in unit-vector
notation? (b) What is the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration
on the planet? (c) How long after it is released does the shot
reach the ground? (d) If an identical throw of the shot is made on
the surface of Earth, how long after it is released does it reach the
ground?

133 A helicopter is flying in a straight line over a level field at
a constant speed of 6.20 m/s and at a constant altitude of 9.50 m.
A package is ejected horizontally from the helicopter with an
initial velocity of 12.0 m/s relative to the helicopter and in a di-
rection opposite the helicopter’s motion. (a) Find the initial
speed of the package relative to the ground. (b) What is the hori-
zontal distance between the helicopter and the package at the
instant the package strikes the ground? (c) What angle does the
velocity vector of the package make with the ground at the in-
stant before impact, as seen from the ground?

134 Acar travels around a flat circle on the ground, at a constant
speed of 12.0 m/s. Ata certain instant the car has an acceleration of
3.00 m/s? toward the east. What are its distance and direction from
the center of the circle at that instant if it is traveling (a) clockwise
around the circle and (b) counterclockwise around the circle?

135 You throw a ball from a cliff with an initial velocity of
15.0 m/s at an angle of 20.0° below the horizontal. Find (a) its hori-
zontal displacement and (b) its vertical displacement 2.30 s later.

136 A baseball is hit at Fenway Park in Boston at a point
0.762 m above home plate with an initial velocity of 33.53 m/s di-
rected 55.0° above the horizontal. The ball is observed to clear
the 11.28-m-high wall in left field (known as the “green mon-
ster”) 5.00 s after it is hit, at a point just inside the left-field foul-
line pole. Find (a) the horizontal distance down the left-field foul
line from home plate to the wall; (b) the vertical distance by
which the ball clears the wall; (c) the horizontal and vertical dis-
placements of the ball with respect to home plate 0.500 s before
it clears the wall.

137 A transcontinental flight of 4350 km is scheduled to take
50 min longer westward than eastward. The airspeed of the air-
plane is 966 km/h, and the jet stream it will fly through is pre-
sumed to move due east. What is the assumed speed of the jet
stream?

138 A woman can row a boat at 6.40 km/h in still water. (a) If
she is crossing a river where the current is 3.20 km/h, in what di-
rection must her boat be headed if she wants to reach a point di-
rectly opposite her starting point? (b) If the river is 6.40 km
wide, how long will she take to cross the river? (c) Suppose that
instead of crossing the river she rows 3.20 km down the river and
then back to her starting point. How long will she take? (d) How
long will she take to row 3.20 km up the river and then back to
her starting point? (e) In what direction should she head the
boat if she wants to cross in the shortest possible time, and what
is that time?
