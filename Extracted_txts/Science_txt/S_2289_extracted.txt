Sample Problem 5.01

Here are examples of how to use Newton’s second law for a
puck when one or two forces act on it. Parts A, B, and C of
Fig. 5-3 show three situations in which one or two forces act
on a puck that moves over frictionless ice along an x axis, in
one-dimensional motion. The puck’s mass is m = 0.20 kg.
Forces F, and F, are directed along the axis and have
magnitudes F, = 4.0 N and F, = 2.0 N. Force K is directed
at angle @ = 30° and has magnitude F; = 1.0 N. In each situ-
ation, what is the acceleration of the puck?

KEY IDEA

 

In each situation we can relate the acceleration @ to the net
force F,; acting on the puck with Newton’s second law,
F, = ma. However, because the motion is along only the x
axis, we can simplify each situation by writing the second
law for x components only:

Fret. = May.

The free-body diagrams for the three situations are also
given in Fig. 5-3, with the puck represented by a dot.

Situation A: For Fig. 5-3b, where only one horizontal force
acts, Eq. 5-4 gives us
F, = ma,,
which, with given data, yields
_F 4.0N

m > 0.20kg 20 m/s*.

(Answer)

The positive answer indicates that the acceleration is in the
positive direction of the x axis.

Situation B: In Rig. 5-3d, two horizontal forces act on the
puck, F; in the positive direction of x and F, in the negative
direction. Now Eq. 5-4 gives us
F, — Fy =ma,,

which, with given data, yields

_F.-— _40N—20N _ 2

a, = mi = 0.20 ke = 10 m/s’.
(Answer)

Thus, the net force accelerates the puck in the positive direc-
tion of the x axis.

Situation C: In Fig. 5-3f, force F, is not directed along the
direction of the puck’s acceleration; only x component F; .

Thus, the net force accelerates the puck in the negative di-
