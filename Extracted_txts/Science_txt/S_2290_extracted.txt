5-1 NEWTON’S FIRST AND SECOND LAWS 101

Sample Problem 5.02 Two-dimensional forces, cookie tin

Here we find a missing force by using the acceleration. In
the overhead view of Fig. 5-4a, a 2.0 kg cookie tin is acceler-
ated at 3.0 m/s? in the direction shown by @, over a friction-
less horizontal surface. The acceleration is caused by three
horizontal forces, only two of which are shown: F;; of magni-
tude 10 N and F) of magnitude 20 N. What is the third force
F, in unit-vector notation and in magnitude-angle notation?

KEY IDEA

The net force Fue on the tin is the sum of the three forces
and is related to the acceleration @ via Newton’s second law
(Fe, = ma).Thus,

F, + F, + F,=ma (5-6)

which gives us

F, = ma — F, - F,. (5-7)

Calculations: Because this is a two-dimensional problem,
we cannot find F merely by substituting the magnitudes for
the vector quantities on the right side of Eq. 5-7. Instead, we
must vectorially add ma, —F, (the reverse of F), and —F,
(the reverse of F >), as shown in Fig. 5-4b. This addition can
be done directly on a vector-capable calculator because we
know both magnitude and angle for all three vectors.
However, here we shall evaluate the right side of Eq. 5-7 in
terms of components, first along the x axis and then along
the y axis. Caution: Use only one axis at a time.

This is the resulting
horizontal acceleration

xcomponents: Along the x axis we have
CE TTL eel Trae Ete
= m(a cos 50°) — F, cos(—150°) —
Then, substituting known data, we find
= (2.0 kg) (3.0 m/s?) cos 50° — (10 N) cos(—150°)
— (20 N) cos 90°
=125N.

Fy cos 90°.

ycomponents: Similarly, along the y axis we find
yal i yl ody
= m(a sin 50°) — F, sin(—150°) — F, sin 90°
= (2.0 kg)(3.0 m/s?) sin 50° — (10 N) sin(—150°)
— (20 N) sin 90°

=—104N.

Vector: In unit-vector notation, we can write
Fy= Fy, + Fyyj = (12.5N)i — 10.4N)p
= (13N)i — (1ON)j. (Answer)

We can now use a vector-capable calculator to get the mag-

nitude and the angle of F';. We can also use Eq. 3-6 to obtain
the magnitude and the angle (from the positive direction of

the x axis) as
= VFi, + FR, = 16N

and 6=tan! = —40°.

 

(Answer)
Bx

We draw the product
of mass and acceleration
as a vector.

 

Then we can add the three
vectors to find the missing
third force vector.
