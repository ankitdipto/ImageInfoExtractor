Distribution of the Elements

Of the 92 naturally occurring elements on earth, only 11 are
found in organisms in more than trace amounts (0.01% or
higher). These 11 elements have atomic numbers less than
21 and, thus, have low atomic masses. Table 2.1 lists the
levels of various elements in the human body; their levels in
other organisms are similar. Inspection of this table suggests
that the distribution of elements in living systems is by no
means accidental. The most common elements inside or-
ganisms are not the elements that are most abundant in the

earth’s crust. For example, silicon, aluminum, and iron con-
stitute 39.2% of the earth’s crust, but they exist in trace
amounts in the human body. On the other hand, carbon at-
oms make up 18.5% of the human body but only 0.03% of
the earth’s crust.

 

Ninety-two elements occur naturally on earth; only
eleven of them are found in significant amounts in living
organisms. Four of them—oxygen, hydrogen, carbon,
nitrogen—constitute 96.3% of the weight of your body.
