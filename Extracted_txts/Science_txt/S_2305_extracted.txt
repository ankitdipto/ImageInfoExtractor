9 Figure 5-26 shows a train of four blocks being pulled across a
frictionless floor by force F. What total mass is accelerated to the
right by (a) force F, (b) cord 3, and (c) cord 1? (d) Rank the blocks
according to their accelerations, greatest first. (e) Rank the cords
according to their tension, greatest first.

Fy, on block 3 from block 2? (d) Rank the blocks according to
their acceleration magnitudes, greatest first. (e) Rank forces F, Fy),
and Fy according to magnitude, greatest first.

11 A vertical force F is applied to a block of mass m that lies on
a floor. What happens to the magnitude of the normal force Fon
the block from the floor as magnitude F is increased from zero if
force F is (a) downward and (b) upward?

12 Figure 5-28 shows four choices for the direction of a force of
magnitude F to be applied toa block
on an inclined plane. The directions
are either horizontal or vertical.
(For choice b, the force is not
enough to lift the block off the
plane.) Rank the choices according
to the magnitude of the normal
force acting on the block from the
plane, greatest first.

*1 Only two horizontal forces act on a 3.0 kg body that can move
over a frictionless floor. One force is 9.0 N, acting due east, and the
other is 8.0 N, acting 62° north of west. What is the magnitude of
the body’s acceleration?

*2 Two horizontal forces act on a 2.0 kg chopping block that can
slide over a frictionless kitchen counter, which lies in an xy plane.
One force is F, = (3.0 N)i + (4.0 N)j. Find the acceleration of the
chopping block in unit-vector notation when the other force is
(a) F, = (-3.0N)i + (-4.0N)j, (b) F, = (-3.0N)i + GON),
and (c) F, = (3.0N)i + (—4.0N)j.

°3 If the 1 kg standard body has an acceleration of 2.00 m/s* at
20.0° to the positive direction of an x axis, what are (a) the x com-
ponent and (b) the y component of the net force acting on the
body, and (c) what is the net force in unit-vector notation?

**4 While two forces act on it, a
particle is to move at the constant
velocity ¥ = (3 mis)i — (4 m/s)j. One
of the forces is F,=(2N)i+
(-6 Nj. What is the other force?

by jet backpacks, push and guide a
120 kg asteroid toward a processing
dock, exerting the forces shown in
Be 9, with F, =32N, F)=55N,
=41N, 6, =30°, and 6 = 60°.
What is the asteroid’s acceleration
(a) in unit-vector notation and as (b) a magnitude and (c) a direc-
tion relative to the positive direction of the x axis?

6 In a two-dimensional tug-of-
war, Alex, Betty, and Charles pull
horizontally on an automobile tire at
the angles shown in the overhead
view of Fig. 5-30. The tire remains
stationary in spite of the three pulls.
Alex pulls with force F,of magni-
tude 220N, and Charles pulls with
force Fe of magnitude 170N. Note
that the direction of Fe is not given.
What is the magnitude of Betty’s
force F,?

 

“7 SSM There are two forces on the
2.00 kg box in the overhead view of
Fig, 5-31, but only one is shown. For
F, = 20.0 N,a= 12.0 m's’,and @ = 30.0,
find the second force (a) in unit-vector
notation and as (b) a magnitude and
(c) an angle relative to the positive di-
rection of the x axis.

8 A 2.00kg object is subjected to
three forces that give it an acceleration
@ = —(8.00 mis*)i + (6.00 mis*)j. If
two of the three forces are
F, = (30.0N)i + (16.0.N)j and F,
—(12.0N)i + (8.00 N)j, find the third force.

to x(t) = —15.00 + 2.00r — 4.0078 and y(t) = 25.00 + 7.00¢ — 9.002,
with x and y in meters and ¢ in seconds. At t = 0.700 s, what are
