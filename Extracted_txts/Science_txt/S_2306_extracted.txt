the angle of the particle’s direction of travel?

+10 @ A 0.150kg particle moves along an x axis according
to x(#) = —13.00 + 2.00 + 4.007 — 3.007, with x in meters and f in
seconds. In unit-vector notation, what is the net force acting on the
particle at t = 3.40 s?

+11 A2.0kg particle moves along an x axis, being propelled by a
variable force directed along that axis. Its position is given by x =
3.0 m + (4.0 m/s)t + ct? — (2.0 m/s*)¢3, with x in meters and ¢ in
seconds. The factor c is a constant. At f = 3.0 s, the force on the par-
ticle has a magnitude of 36 N and is in the negative direction of the
axis. What is c?

612 © Two horizontal forces F, and F, act on a 4.0 kg disk that
slides over frictionless ice, on which an xy coordinate system is laid
out. Force F is in the positive direction of the x axis and has a mag-
nitude of 7.0. Force F, has a magnitude of 9.0N. Figure 5-32
gives the x component v, of the velocity of the disk as a function of
time ¢ during the sliding. What is the angle between the constant di-
rections of forces F and F;?

13 Figure 5-33 shows an arrangement in
which four disks are suspended by cords. The
longer, top cord loops over a frictionless pul-
ley and pulls with a force of magnitude 98 N
on the wall to which it is attached. The tensions
in the three shorter cords are T, = 58.8N,
T) = 49.0, and T;=9.8N. What are the
masses of (a) disk A, (b) disk B, (c) disk C,
and (d) disk D?

°14 A block with a weight of 3.0N is at
rest ona horizontal surface. A 1.0 N upward
force is applied to the block by means of an
attached vertical string. What are the (a)
magnitude and (b) direction of the force of
the block on the horizontal surface?

a spring scale, which is supported by a cord hung from the ceiling
(Fig. 5-34a). What is the reading on the scale, which is marked in ST
weight units? (This is a way to measure weight by a deli owner.) (b)
In Fig, 5-346 the salami is supported by a cord that runs around a
pulley and to a scale. The opposite end of the scale is attached by a
cord to a wall. What is the reading on the scale? (This is the way by
a physics major.) (c) In Fig, 5-34c the wall has been replaced with a
second 11.0 kg salami, and the assembly is stationary. What is the

16 Some insects can walk below
a thin rod (such as a twig) by hang-
ing from it. Suppose that such an in-
sect has mass m and hangs from a
horizontal rod as shown in Fig. 5-35,
with angle @= 40°. Its six legs are all
under the same tension, and the leg
sections nearest the body are hori-
zontal. (a) What is the ratio of the
tension in each tibia (forepart of a leg) to the insect’s weight? (b) If
the insect straightens out its legs somewhat, does the tension in each
tibia increase, decrease, or stay the same?

°18 <== In April 1974, John
Massis of Belgium managed to
move two passenger railroad
cars. He did so by clamping his teeth down on a bit that was at-
tached to the cars with a rope and then leaning backward while
pressing his feet against the railway ties. The cars together weighed
700 KN (about 80 tons). Assume that he pulled with a constant
force that was 2.5 times his body weight, at an upward angle 6 of
30° from the horizontal. His mass was 80 kg, and he moved the cars
by 1.0 m. Neglecting any retarding force from the wheel rotation,
find the speed of the cars at the end of the pull.
