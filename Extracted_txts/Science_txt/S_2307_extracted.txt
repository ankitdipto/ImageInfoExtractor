118 CHAPTER 5 FORCE AND MOTION-I

*19 ssm A 500kg rocket sled can be accelerated at a constant
rate from rest to 1600 km/h in 1.8 s. What is the magnitude of the
required net force?

°20 A car traveling at 53 km/h hits a bridge abutment. A passen-
ger in the car moves forward a distance of 65 cm (with respect to
the road) while being brought to rest by an inflated air bag. What
magnitude of force (assumed constant) acts on the passenger’s up-
per torso, which has a mass of 41 kg?

21 A constant horizontal force F, pushes a 2.00 kg FedEx pack-
age across a frictionless floor on which an xy coordinate system has
been drawn. Figure 5-37 gives the package’s x and y velocity com-
ponents versus time ¢. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of F,?

°22 <== A customer sits in an amusement park ride in which the
compartment is to be pulled downward in the negative direction of
ay axis with an acceleration magnitude of 1.24g, with g = 9.80 m/s”.
A 0.567 g coin rests on the customer's knee. Once the motion be-
gins and in unit-vector notation, what is the coin’s acceleration rel-
ative to (a) the ground and (b) the customer? (c) How long does
the coin take to reach the compartment ceiling, 2.20 m above the
knee? In unit-vector notation, what are (d) the actual force on the
coin and (e) the apparent force according to the customer’s meas-
ure of the coin’s acceleration?

23 Tarzan, who weighs 820 N, swings from a cliff at the end of a
20.0 m vine that hangs from a high tree limb and initially makes an
angle of 22.0° with the vertical. Assume that an x axis extends hori-
zontally away from the cliff edge and a y axis extends upward.
Immediately after Tarzan steps off the cliff, the tension in the vine
is 760 N. Just then, what are (a) the force on him from the vine in
unit-vector notation and the net force on him (b) in unit-vector no-
tation and as (c) a magnitude and (d) an angle relative to the
positive direction of the x axis? What are the (e) magnitude and
(f) angle of Tarzan’s acceleration just then?

 

 

 

 

°24 There are two horizontal RK
forces on the 2.0 kg box in the over-._ —————>——-. *
head view of Fig, 5-38 but only one

(of magnitude F, = 20N) is shown.
The box moves along the x axis. For
each of the following values for the acceleration a, of the box,
find the second force in unit-vector notation: (a) 10 m/s”, (b) 20 m/s”,
(c)0,(d) —10 nvs*, and (e) —20 m/s”.

+25 Sunjamming. A “sun yacht” is a spacecraft with a large sail
that is pushed by sunlight. Although such a push is tiny in everyday
circumstances, it can be large enough to send the spacecraft
outward from the Sun on a cost-free but slow trip. Suppose that
the spacecraft has a mass of 900 kg and receives a push of 20 N.
(a) What is the magnitude of the resulting acceleration? If the craft
starts from rest, (b) how far will it travel in 1 day and (c) how fast
will it then be moving?

+26 The tension at which a fishing line snaps is commonly called the
line’s “strength.” What minimum strength is needed for a line that is to
stop a salmon of weight 85 N in 11 cm if the fish is initially drifting at
2.8 m/s? Assume a constant deceleration.

°27 SSM An electron with a speed of 1.2 x 107 m/s moves hori-
zontally into a region where a constant vertical force of 4.5 x
10-'©N acts on it. The mass of the electron is 9.11 X 10- kg.
Determine the vertical distance the electron is deflected during the
time it has moved 30 mm horizontally.

°28 A car that weighs 1.30 x 104N is initially moving at
40 km/h when the brakes are applied and the car is brought to a
stop in 15 m. Assuming the force that stops the car is constant,
find (a) the magnitude of that force and (b) the time required for
the change in speed. If the initial speed is doubled, and the car ex-
periences the same force during the braking, by what factors are
(c) the stopping distance and (d) the stopping time multiplied?
(There could be a lesson here about the danger of driving at high
speeds.)

+29 A firefighter who weighs 712 N slides down a vertical pole
with an acceleration of 3.00 m/s”, directed downward. What are the
(a) magnitude and (b) direction (up or down) of the vertical force
on the firefighter from the pole and the (c) magnitude and (d) di-
rection of the vertical force on the pole from the firefighter?

+30 <= The high-speed winds around a tornado can drive pro-
jectiles into trees, building walls, and even metal traffic signs. In a
laboratory simulation, a standard wood toothpick was shot by
pneumatic gun into an oak branch. The toothpick’s mass was 0.13 g,
its speed before entering the branch was 220 m/s, and its penetra-
tion depth was 15 mm. If its speed was decreased at a uniform
rate, what was the magnitude of the force of the branch on the
toothpick?

“31 SSM WWW A block is projected up a frictionless inclined
plane with initial speed vy = 3.50
m/s. The angle of incline is
6 = 32.0°. (a) How far up the plane
does the block go? (b) How long
does it take to get there? (c) What is
its speed when it gets back to the
bottom?
