*°41 Using a rope that will snap if the tension in it exceeds 387 N,
you need to lower a bundle of old roofing material weighing 449 N
from a point 6.1 m above the ground. Obviously if you hang the bun-
dle on the rope, it will snap. So, you allow the bundle to accelerate
downward. (a) What magnitude of the bundle’s acceleration will put
the rope on the verge of snapping? (b) At that acceleration, with
what speed would the bundle hit the ground?

47 @ <<" The Zacchini family was renowned for their hu-
man-cannonball act in which a family member was shot from a
cannon using either elastic bands or compressed air. In one version
of the act, Emanuel Zacchini was shot over three Ferris wheels to
land in a net at the same height as the open end of the cannon and
at arrange of 69 m. He was propelled inside the barrel for 5.2 m and
launched at an angle of 53°. If his mass was 85 kg and he underwent
constant acceleration inside the barrel, what was the magnitude of
the force propelling him? (Hint: Treat the launch as though it were
along a ramp at 53°. Neglect air drag.)
