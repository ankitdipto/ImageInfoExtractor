120 CHAPTER 5 FORCE AND MOTION-I

48 @ In Fig. 5-44, elevator cabs A and B are con-
nected by a short cable and can be pulled upward or
lowered by the cable above cab A. Cab A has mass
1700 kg: cab B has mass 1300 kg. A 12.0 kg box of cat-
nip lies on the floor of cab A. The tension in the cable
connecting the cabs is 1.91 x 10* N. What is the mag-
nitude of the normal force on the box from the floor?

49 In Fig. 5-45, a block of mass m = 5.00kg is
pulled along a horizontal frictionless floor by a cord
that exerts a force of magnitude F = 12.0N at an
angle @=25.0°. (a) What is the magnitude of the
block’s acceleration? (b) The force magnitude F is
slowly increased. What is its value just before the
block is lifted (completely) off the floor? (c) What is
the magnitude of the block’s acceleration just before it is lifted
(completely) off the floor?

50 @ In Fig. 5-46, three ballot 4

boxes are connected by cords, one

of which wraps over a pulley having B
negligible friction on its axle and
negligible mass. The three masses
are m,=30.0kg, mp = 40.0kg,
and mc = 10.0 kg. When the assem-
bly is released from rest, (a) what is the tension in the cord con-
necting B and C, and (b) how far does A move in the first 0.250 s
(assuming it does not reach the pulley)?

°°51 © Higure 5-47 shows two blocks connected by
a cord (of negligible mass) that passes over a fric-
tionless pulley (also of negligible mass). The
arrangement is known as Atwood’s machine. One
block has mass mm, = 1.30 kg: the other has mass m, =
2.80 kg. What are (a) the magnitude of the blocks’ ac-

celeration and (b) the tension in the cord? me

52 An 85 kg man lowers himself to the ground
from a height of 10.0 m by holding onto a rope that
runs over a frictionless pulley to a 65 kg sandbag.
With what speed does the man hit the ground if he
started from rest?

**53 In Fig, 5-48, three connected blocks are
pulled to the right on a horizontal frictionless table
bya force of magnitude T; = 65.0N. If m, = 12.0kg,
my = 24.0 kg, and m; = 31.0 kg, calculate (a) the magnitude of the
system’s acceleration, (b) the tension T;, and (c) the tension 7.

54 @ Figure 5-49 shows four penguins that are being playfully
pulled along very slippery (frictionless) ice by a curator. The masses
of three penguins and the tension in two of the cords are m, = 12 kg,
ms = 15kg, ms = 20 kg, T; = 111 N, and T; = 222 N. Find the pen-
guin mass 77, that is not given.

55 SSM ILW WWW Two blocks are in “1
contact on a frictionless table. A horizon- my
tal force is applied to the larger block, as
shown in Fig. 5-50. (a) If m;=2.3kg,
m = 1.2kg, and F = 3.2 N, find the mag-
nitude of the force between the two
blocks. (b) Show that if a force of the same
magnitude F is applied to the smaller
block but in the opposite direction, the magnitude of the force be-
tween the blocks is 2.1 N, which is not the same value calculated in
(a).(c) Explain the difference.

56 @ In Fig. 5-51a, a constant horizontal force F, is applied to
block A, which pushes against block B with a 20.0 N force directed
horizontally to the right. In Fig, 5-51, the same force F, is applied
to block B; now block A pushes on block B with a 10.0N force
directed horizontally to the left. The blocks have a combined mass
of 12.0 kg. What are the magnitudes of (a) their acceleration in
Fig, 5-Sla and (b) force F,?

clined at angle 9 = 30.0° is connected by a cord over a massless,
frictionless pulley to a second block of mass m, = 2.30 kg (Fig.
5-52). What are (a) the magnitude of the acceleration of each
block, (b) the direction of the acceleration of the hanging block,
and (c) the tension in the cord?

gles from a massless rope, which runs over a massless, frictionless
pulley and back down to the man’s hand. The combined mass of
