1.30 m/s”? (Hint: A free-body dia-
gram can really help.) If the rope
on the right extends to the ground
and is pulled by a co-worker, with
what force magnitude must the co-
worker pull for the man to rise (c)
with a constant velocity and (d)
with an upward acceleration of
1.30 m/s*? What is the magnitude
of the force on the ceiling from the
pulley system in (e) part a, (f) part

°59 ssM A 10kg monkey climbs
up a massless rope that runs over a
frictionless tree limb and_ back
down to a 15kg package on the
ground (Fig. 5-54). (a) What is the
magnitude of the least acceleration
the monkey must have if it is to lift
the package off the ground? If, after
the package has been lifted, the {
monkey stops its climb and holds

onto the rope, what are the (b)

magnitude and (c) direction of the

monkey’s acceleration and (d) the

tension in the rope?

60 Figure 5-45 shows a 5.00 kg
block being pulled along a friction-
less floor by a cord that applies a
force of constant magnitude 20.0 N
but with an angle @(t) that varies
with time. When angle @ = 25.0°, at
what rate is the acceleration of the
block changing if (a) @f)=
(2.00 x 10-2 deg/s)t and (b) At) = —(2.00 x 10-2 deg/s)t? (Hint:
The angle should be in radians.)

°°61 SSM ILW A hot-air balloon of mass M is descending vertically
with downward acceleration of magnitude a. How much mass (ballast)
must be thrown out to give the balloon an upward acceleration of mag-
nitude a? Assume that the upward force from the air (the lift) does not
change because of the decrease in mass.

°°°62 <= In shot putting, many athletes elect to launch the shot
at an angle that is smaller than the theoretical one (about 42°) at
which the distance of a projected ball at the same speed and
height is greatest. One reason has to do with the speed the athlete
can give the shot during the acceleration phase of the throw.
Assume that a 7.260 kg shot is accelerated along a straight path of
length 1.650 m by a constant applied force of magnitude 380.0 N,
starting with an initial speed of 2.500 m/s (due to the athlete’s pre-
liminary motion). What is the shot’s speed at the end of the accel-
eration phase if the angle between the path and the horizontal is
(a) 30.00° and (b) 42.00°? (Hint: Treat the motion as though it
were along a ramp at the given angle.) (c) By what percent is the
launch speed decreased if the athlete increases the angle from
30.00° to 42.00°?

tionless plane inclined at angle @ = 30°. It is connected by a cord of
negligible mass to a box of mass m, = 3.0 kg on a horizontal fric-
tionless surface. The pulley is frictionless and massless. (a) If the
magnitude of horizontal force F is 2.3 N, what is the tension in the

tainers are connected by a cord (of negligible mass) passing over a
frictionless pulley (also of negligible mass). At time = 0,container
