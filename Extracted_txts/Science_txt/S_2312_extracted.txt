88 Imagine a landing craft approaching the surface of Callisto,
one of Jupiter’s moons. If the engine provides an upward force

jet by just three bolts (this is the usual practice). Assume that each
bolt supports one-third of the load. (a) Calculate the force on each

94 For sport, a 12 kg armadillo runs onto a large pond of level,
frictionless ice. The armadillo’s initial velocity is 5.0 m/s along the
positive direction of an x axis. Take its initial position on the ice as

96 A nucleus that captures a stray neutron must bring the neu-
tron to a stop within the diameter of the nucleus by means of the
strong force. That force, which “glues” the nucleus together, is ap-
proximately zero outside the nucleus. Suppose that a stray neutron
with an initial speed of 1.4 X 107 m/s is just barely captured by a
nucleus with diameter d= 1.0 X 10~'*m. Assuming the strong
force on the neutron is constant, find the magnitude of that force.
