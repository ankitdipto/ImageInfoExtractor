130 CHAPTER 6 FORCE AND MOTION-II

force, not the full force. From Sample Problem 5.04 (see Fig.
5-15i), we write that balance as
Fy =mg cos @.
In spite of these changes, we still want to write Newton’s
second law (Fyet. = ma,) for the motion along the (now
tilted) x axis. We have
—fie + mg sin 0 = ma,,

— Fy + mg sin 0 = ma,,

and — yng cos 8 + mg sin 6 = ma,.

Solving for the acceleration and substituting the given data

 

now give us
d, = —pxg cos 0+ gsin é
= —(0.10)(9.8 m/s?) cos 5.00° + (9.8 m/s?) sin 5.00°
= —0.122 mis”. (6-13)
Substituting this result into Eq. 6-11 gives us the stopping
distance hown the hill:
xX — Xp = 409 m ~ 400 m,

which is about } mi! Such icy hills separate people who can
do this calculation (and thus know to stay home) from peo-
ple who cannot (and thus end up in web videos).

6-2 THE DRAG FORCE AND TERMINAL SPEED

 

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

6.04 Apply the relationship between the drag force on an
object moving through air and the speed of the object.

Key Ideas

6.05 Determine the terminal speed of an object falling
through air.

 

@ When there is relative motion between air (or some other
fluid) and a body, the body experiences a drag force D that
opposes the relative motion and points in the direction in
which the fluid flows relative to the body. The magnitude of D
is related to the relative speed v by an experimentally deter-
mined drag coefficient C according to

D = }3CpAv?,

where pis the fluid density (mass per unit volume) and A
is the effective cross-sectional area of the body (the area

of across section taken perpendicular to the relative
velocity ¥).

@ When a blunt object has fallen far enough through air, the __
magnitudes of the drag force D andthe gravitational force F,
on the body become equal. The body then falls at a constant
terminal speed v, given by

_,| 2%
v= GA"

 

The Drag Force and Terminal Speed

A fluid is anything that can flow—generally either a gas or a liquid. When there is
a relative velocity between a fluid and a body (either because the body moves
through the fluid or because the fluid moves past the body), the body experiences
a drag force D that opposes the relative motion and points in the direction in
which the fluid flows relative to the body.

Here we examine only cases in which air is the fluid, the body is blunt (like
a baseball) rather than slender (like a javelin), and the relative motion is fast
enough so that the air becomes turbulent (breaks up into swirls) behind the
body. In such cases, the magnitude of the drag force D is related to the relative
speed v by an experimentally determined drag coefficient C according to

= 5CpAv?, (6-14)
