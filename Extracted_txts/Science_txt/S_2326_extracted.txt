(b) The magnitude F,, of the negative lift on a car depends
on the square of the car’s speed v?, just as the drag force
does (Eq. 6-14). Thus, the negative lift on the car here is
greater when the car travels faster, as it does on a straight
section of track. What is the magnitude of the negative lift
for a speed of 90 m/s?

Fis proportional to v>.

Calculations: Thus we can write a ratio of the negative lift

Sample Problem 6.06 Car in banked circular turn

This problem is quite challenging in setting up but takes
only a few lines of algebra to solve. We deal with not only
uniformly circular motion but also a ramp. However, we will
not need a tilted coordinate system as with other ramps.
Instead we can take a freeze-frame of the motion and work
with simply horizontal and vertical axes. As always in this
chapter, the starting point will be to apply Newton’s second
law, but that will require us to identify the force component
that is responsible for the uniform circular motion.

Curved portions of highways are always banked (tilted)
to prevent cars from sliding off the highway. When a high-
way is dry, the frictional force between the tires and the road
surface may be enough to prevent sliding. When the high-
way is wet, however, the frictional force may be negligible,
and banking is then essential. Rgure 6-11a represents a car

The toward-the-
center force is due
zy to the tilted track.

Substituting our known negative lift of F;, = 663.7 N and
solving for F;, o) give us

F 1,99 = 6572 N ~ 6600 N. (Answer)
Upside-down racing: The gravitational force is, of course,
the force to beat if there is a chance of racing upside down:

F, = mg = (600 kg)(9.8 m/s’)
= 5880 N.

With the car upside down, the negative lift is an upward
force of 6600 N, which exceeds the downward 5880 N. Thus,
the car could run on a long ceiling provided that it moves at
about 90 m/s (= 324 km/h = 201 mi/h). However, moving
that fast while right side up on a horizontal track is danger-
ous enough, so you are not likely to see upside-down racing
except in the movies.

of mass m as it moves at a constant speed v of 20 m/s around
a banked circular track of radius R = 190 m. (It is a normal
car, rather than a race car, which means that any vertical
force from the passing air is negligible.) If the frictional
force from the track is negligible, what bank angle @ pre-
vents sliding?

KEY IDEAS

Here the track is banked so as to tilt the normal force Fy on
the car toward the center of the circle (Fig. 6-11). Thus, K
now has a centripetal component of magnitude Fy,, directed
inward along a radial axis r. We want to find the value of
the bank angle @ such that this centripetal component
keeps the car on the circular track without need of friction.
