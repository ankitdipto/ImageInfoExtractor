Module 6-1 Friction

°1 The floor of a railroad flatcar is loaded with loose crates hav-
ing a coefficient of static friction of 0.25 with the floor. If the train
is initially moving at a speed of 48 km/h, in how short a distance
can the train be stopped at constant acceleration without causing
the crates to slide over the floor?

+2 In apickup game of dorm shuffleboard, students crazed by fi-
nal exams use a broom to propel a calculus book along the dorm
hallway. If the 3.5 kg book is pushed from rest through a distance
of 0.90 m by the horizontal 25 N force from the broom and then
has a speed of 1.60 m/s, what is the coefficient of kinetic friction be-
tween the book and floor?

+3 SSM WWW A bedroom bureau with a mass of 45 kg, includ-
ing drawers and clothing, rests on the floor. (a) If the coefficient of
static friction between the bureau and the floor is 0.45, what is the
magnitude of the minimum horizontal force that a person must ap-
ply to start the bureau moving? (b) If the drawers and clothing,
with 17 kg mass, are removed before the bureau is pushed, what is
the new minimum magnitude?

*4 A slide-loving pig slides down a certain 35° slide in twice the
time it would take to slide down a frictionless 35° slide. What is the
coefficient of kinetic friction between the pig and the slide?

°5 © A 2.5 kg block is initially at rest on a horizontal surface. A
horizontal force F of magnitude 6.0 N and a vertical force P are
then applied to the block (Fig. 6-17). The coefficients of friction for
the block and surface are “4, = 0.40 and jy, = 0.25. Determine the
magnitude of the frictional force acting on the block if the magni-
tude of Pis (a) 8.0N, (b) 10 N,and (c) 12N.

*6 A baseball player with mass m = 79 kg, sliding into second
base, is retarded by a frictional force of magnitude 470 N. What is
the coefficient of kinetic friction 4, between the player and the
ground?

*7 SSM ILW A person pushes horizontally with a force of 220N
on a 55 kg crate to move it across a level floor. The coefficient
of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is 0.35. What is
the magnitude of (a) the frictional force and (b) the acceleration of
the crate?

°8 <= The mysterious sliding stones. Along the remote
Racetrack Playa in Death Valley, California, stones sometimes
gouge out prominent trails in the desert floor, as if the stones
had been migrating (Fig. 6-18). For years curiosity mounted
about why the stones moved. One explanation was that strong
winds during occasional rainstorms would drag the rough stones

over ground softened by rain. When the desert dried out, the
trails behind the stones were hard-baked in place. According to
measurements, the coefficient of kinetic friction between the
stones and the wet playa ground is about 0.80. What horizontal
force must act on a 20 kg stone (a typical mass) to maintain the
stone’s motion once a gust has started it moving? (Story contin-
ues with Problem 37.)

°9 @ A 35kg block is pushed
along a horizontal floor by a force
F of magnitude 15 N at an angle

and the floor is 0.25. Calculate the Problems 9 and 32.
magnitudes of (a) the frictional
force on the block from the floor
and (b) the block’s acceleration.

10 Figure 6-20 shows an initially
stationary block of mass m on a
floor. A force of magnitude 0.500mg
is then applied at upward angle @ =
20°. What is the magnitude of the ac-
celeration of the block across the
floor if the friction coefficients are (a) jz, = 0.600 and p, = 0.500
and (b) 4, =0.400 and py, = 0.300?

*11 SSM A 68kg crate is dragged across a floor by pulling on
a rope attached to the crate and inclined 15° above the horizontal.
(a) If the coefficient of static friction is 0.50, what minimum force
magnitude is required from the rope to start the crate moving?
(b) If 4, = 0.35, what is the magnitude of the initial acceleration of
the crate?
