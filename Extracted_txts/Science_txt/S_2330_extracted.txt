hand on one side and the fingers on the opposite
side (Fig, 6-21). Sincosky’s mass was 79 kg. If the
coefficient of static friction between hand and
rafter was 0.70, what was the least magnitude of
the normal force on the rafter from each thumb
or opposite fingers? (After suspending himself,
Sincosky chinned himself on the rafter and then
moved hand-over-hand along the rafter. If you do
not think Sincosky’s grip was remarkable, try to
repeat his stunt.)

*13 A worker pushes horizontally on a 35 kg
crate with a force of magnitude 110 N. The coeffi-
cient of static friction between the crate and the
floor is 0.37. (a) What is the value of f, yay under
the circumstances? (b) Does the crate move?
(c) What is the frictional force on the crate from
the floor? (d) Suppose,next, that a second worker
pulls directly upward on the crate to help out.
What is the least vertical pull that will allow the
first worker’s 110 N push to move the crate? (e)
If, instead, the second worker pulls horizontally to help out, what is
the least pull that will get the crate moving?

*14 Figure 6-22 shows the cross
section of a road cut into the side of
a mountain. The solid line AA' rep- B
resents a weak bedding plane along
which sliding is possible. Block B
directly above the highway is sepa-
rated from uphill rock by a large
crack (called a joint), so that onh
friction between the block and the
bedding plane prevents sliding. The
mass of the block is 1.8 X 10’ kg, the dip angle @ of the bedding
plane is 24°, and the coefficient of static friction between block
and plane is 0.63. (a) Show that the block will not slide under
these circumstances. (b) Next, water seeps into the joint and ex-
pands upon freezing, exerting on the block a force F parallel to
AA'. What minimum value of force magnitude F will trigger a
slide down the plane?

*15 The coefficient of static friction between Teflon and scram-
bled eggs is about 0.04. What is the smallest angle from the hori-
zontal that will cause the eggs to slide across the bottom of a
Teflon-coated skillet?

**16 A loaded penguin sled weigh- E

angle @= 20° to the horizontal (Fig.

plane, the coefficient of static
friction is 0.25, and the coefficient of
kinetic friction is 0.15. (a) What is
the least magnitude of the force F,
parallel to the plane, that will pre-
vent the sled from slipping down the plane? (b) What is the mini-
mum magnitude F that will start the sled moving up the plane? (c)
What value of F is required to
move the sled up the plane at con-
stant velocity?

18 © You testify as an expert witness in a case involving an acci-
dent in which car A slid into the rear of car B, which was stopped at
a red light along a road headed down a hill (Fig. 6-25). You find
that the slope of the hill is @ = 12.0°, that the cars were separated
by distance d = 24.0 m when the driver of car A put the car into a
slide (it lacked any automatic anti-brake-lock system), and that the
speed of car A at the onset of braking was vy = 18.0 m/s. With what
speed did car A hit car B if the coefficient of kinetic friction was
(a) 0.60 (dry road surface) and (b) 0.10 (road surface covered with

wet leaves)?
