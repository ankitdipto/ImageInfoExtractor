142 CHAPTER 6 FORCE AND MOTION-II

°°23 When the three blocks in 2
Fig. 6-29 are released from rest, they
accelerate with a magnitude of
0.500 m/s’. Block 1 has mass M,
block 2 has 2M, and block 3 has 2M. 3
What is the coefficient of kinetic
friction between block 2 and the
table?

24 A 4.10kg block is pushed
along a floor by a constant applied
force that is horizontal and has a
magnitude of 40.0N. Figure 6-30
gives the block’s speed v versus
time f as the block moves along an x
axis on the floor. The scale of the
figure’s vertical axis is set by v, =
5.0 m/s. What is the coefficient of #6)
kinetic friction between the block Figure 6-30 Problem 24.
and the floor?

25 ssM www Block B in Fig.
6-31 weighs 711 N. The coefficient of
static friction between block and
table is 0.25; angle @ is 30°; assume
that the cord between B and the
knot is horizontal. Find the maxi-
mum weight of block A for which
the system will be stationary.

+26 © Figure 6-32 shows three
crates being pushed over a concrete
floor by a horizontal force F of
magnitude 440 N. The masses of the
crates are m= 30.0kg, m, = 10.0 m,

kg, and m; = 20.0 kg. The coefficient my
of kinetic friction between the floor FE

and each of the crates is 0.700. (a)
What is the magnitude Fy) of the
force on crate 3 from crate 2? (b) If
the crates then slide onto a polished
floor, where the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than 0.700, is
magnitude F,) more than, less than, or the same as it was when the
coefficient was 0.700?

+27 © Body A in Fig. 6-33 weighs
102 N, and body B weighs 32 N. The
coefficients of friction between A
and the incline are w, = 0.56 and
My = 0.25. Angle @ is 40°. Let the
positive direction of an x axis be up
the incline. In unit-vector notation,
what is the acceleration of A if A is
initially (a) at rest, (b) moving up
the incline, and (c) moving down
the incline?

+28 In Fig. 6-33, two blocks are connected over a pulley. The
mass of block A is 10 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction be-
tween A and the incline is 0.20. Angle 0 of the incline is 30°. Block
A slides down the incline at constant speed. What is the mass of
block B? Assume the connecting rope has negligible mass. (The
pulley’s function is only to redirect the rope.)

29 © In Fig. 6-34, blocks A and B have weights of 44 N and 22
N, respectively. (a) Determine the minimum weight of block C to
keep A from sliding if ., between A and the table is 0.20. (b) Block
C suddenly is lifted off A. What is the acceleration of block A if py,
between A and the table is 0.15?

30 A toy chest and its contents have a combined weight of
180 N. The coefficient of static friction between toy chest and floor
is 0.42. The child in Fig. 6-35 attempts to move the chest across the
floor by pulling on an attached rope. (a) If # is 42°, what is the mag-
nitude of the force F that the child must exert on the rope to put
the chest on the verge of moving? (b) Write an expression for the
magnitude F required to put the chest on the verge of moving as a
function of the angle @. Determine (c) the value of 0 for which Fis
aminimum and (d) that minimum magnitude.

*°31 ssM Two blocks, of weights 3.6 N and 7.2 N, are connected
by a massless string and slide down a 30” inclined plane. The coeffi-
cient of kinetic friction between the lighter block and the plane is
0.10, and the coefficient between the heavier block and the plane is
0.20. Assuming that the lighter block leads, find (a) the magnitude
of the acceleration of the blocks and (b) the tension in the taut
string.

32 @ A block is pushed across a floor by a constant force that is
applied at downward angle 6 (Fig, 6-19). Figure 6-36 gives the accel-
eration magnitude a versus a range of values for the coefficient of
kinetic friction yz, between block and floor: a, = 3.0 m/s?, wg =
0.20, and jxy3 = 0.40. What is the value of 6?
