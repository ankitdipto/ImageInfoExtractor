*33 ssmM A 1000 kg boat is traveling at 90 km/h when its engine
is shut off. The magnitude of the frictional force f, between boat
and water is proportional to the speed v of the boat: f,, = 70v, where
v is in meters per second and f;, is in newtons. Find the time required
for the boat to slow to 45 km/h.

floor, and a block of mass m, = 10
kg rests on top of the slab. Between
block and slab, the coefficient of
static friction is 0.60, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.40. A
horizontal force F of magnitude 100 N begins to pull directly on
the block, as shown. In unit-vector notation, what are the resulting
accelerations of (a) the block and (b) the slab?

35 ILW The two blocks (m = 16 m
kg and M = 88 kg) in Fig. 6-38 are
not attached to each other. The coef-
ficient of static friction between the
blocks is 2, = 0.38, but the surface
beneath the larger block is friction-
less. What is the minimum magnitude
of the horizontal force F required to
keep the smaller block from slipping down the larger block?

Module 6-2 The Drag Force and Terminal Speed

*36 The terminal speed of a sky diver is 160 km/h in the spread-
eagle position and 310 km/h in the nosedive position. Assuming
that the diver’s drag coefficient C does not change from one posi-
tion to the other, find the ratio of the effective cross-sectional area
A in the slower position to that in the faster position.

°°37 <= Continuation of Problem 8. Now assume that
Eq. 6-14 gives the magnitude of the air drag force on the typical
20 kg stone, which presents to the wind a vertical cross-sectional
area of 0.040 m? and has a drag coefficient C of 0.80. Take the air
density to be 1.21 kg/m*, and the coefficient of kinetic friction to
be 0.80. (a) In kilometers per hour, what wind speed V along the
ground is needed to maintain the stone’s motion once it has
started moving? Because winds along the ground are retarded by
the ground, the wind speeds reported for storms are often meas-
ured at a height of 10m. Assume wind speeds are 2.00 times
those along the ground. (b) For your answer to (a), what wind
speed would be reported for the storm? (c) Is that value reason-
able for a high-speed wind in a storm? (Story continues with
Problem 65.)

38 Assume Eq. 6-14 gives the drag force on a pilot plus ejection
seat just after they are ejected from a plane traveling horizontally
at 1300 km/h. Assume also that the mass of the seat is equal to the
mass of the pilot and that the drag coefficient is that of a sky diver.
Making a reasonable guess of the pilot's mass and using the
appropriate v, value from Table 6-1, estimate the magnitudes of
(a) the drag force on the pilot + seat and (b) their horizontal de-
celeration (in terms of g), both just after ejection. (The result of
(a) should indicate an engineering requirement: The seat must in-
clude a protective barrier to deflect the initial wind blast away
from the pilot’s head.)

**39 Calculate the ratio of the drag force on a jet flying at
1000 km/h at an altitude of 10km to the drag force on a prop-
driven transport flying at half that speed and altitude. The density

of air is 0.38 kg/m’ at 10 km and 0.67 kg/m? at 5.0 km. Assume that
the airplanes have the same effective cross-sectional area and drag
coefficient C.

40 <8 In downhill speed skiing a skier is retarded by both
the air drag force on the body and the kinetic frictional force on the
skis. (a) Suppose the slope angle is 6 = 40.0°, the snow is dry snow
with a coefficient of kinetic friction 4, = 0.0400, the mass of the
skier and equipment is m = 85.0 kg, the cross-sectional area of the
(tucked) skier is A = 1.30 m’, the drag coefficient is C = 0.150, and
the air density is 1.20 kg/m*. (a) What is the terminal speed? (b) Ifa
skier can vary C by a slight amount dC by adjusting, say, the hand
positions, what is the corresponding variation in the terminal
speed?

ment park, at a radius of 5.4 m from the center of the ride. Then the
operator turns on the ride and brings it up to its proper turning

ing with its claws)?
