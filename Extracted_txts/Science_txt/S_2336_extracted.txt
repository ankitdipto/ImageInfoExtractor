83 You must push a crate across a floor to a docking bay. The
crate weighs 165 N. The coefficient of static friction between crate
and floor is 0.510, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.32.
Your force on the crate is directed horizontally. (a) What magni-
tude of your push puts the crate on the verge of sliding? (b) With
what magnitude must you then push to keep the crate moving at a
constant velocity? (c) If, instead, you then push with the same
magnitude as the answer to (a), what is the magnitude of the
crate’s acceleration?

tion between crate and floor is ,.
Angle @ is initially 0° but is gradu-
ally increased so that the force vec-
tor rotates clockwise in the figure. During the rotation, the mag-
nitude F of the force is continuously adjusted so that the crate is
always on the verge of sliding. For 4, = 0.70, (a) plot the ratio
Fimg versus @ and (b) determine the angle @; at which the ratio
approaches an infinite value. (c) Does lubricating the floor in-
crease or decrease ys, or is the value unchanged? (d) What is A:

down a steep hill, at an angle of 35.0° relative to the horizontal. Just
then the coefficient of static friction between the tires and the
street surface is 0.725. Later, after nightfall, a sleet storm hits the
area, and the coefficient decreases due to both the ice and a chemi-

pouch (0.010 kg) and then begins to make the stone and pouch
move in a vertical circle of radius 0.650 m. The cord between the
pouch and the person’s hand has negligible mass and will break
when the tension in the cord is 33.0 N or more. Suppose the sling-
thrower could gradually increase the speed of the stone. (a) Will
the breaking occur at the lowest point of the circle or at the highest
point? (b) At what speed of the stone will that breaking occur?

up, (c) 48 N, up, (d) 62.N, up, (e) 10N, down, and
(f) 18N, down. In each experiment, what is the
