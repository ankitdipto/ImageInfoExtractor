CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

electronically with nothing material actually moving. However, the total amount
(the total of all the money numbers) can always be accounted for: It is always
conserved. In this chapter we focus on only one type of energy (kinetic energy)
and on only one way in which energy can be transferred (work).

Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy K is energy associated with the state of motion of an object. The
faster the object moves, the greater is its kinetic energy. When the object is

stationary, its kinetic energy is zero.
For an object of mass m whose speed v is well below the speed of light,

K = 4m (kinetic energy). (7-1)

For example, a 3.0 kg duck flying past us at 2.0 m/s has a kinetic energy of
6.0kg- m//s; that is, we associate that number with the duck’s motion.

The SI unit of kinetic energy (and all types of energy) is the joule (J), named
for James Prescott Joule, an English scientist of the 1800s and defined as

joule = = sm/s*. -
1joule = 1J = 1kg- m/s? 72)

Thus, the flying duck has a kinetic energy of 6.0 J.

Sample Problem 7.01 Kinetic energy, train crash

In 1896 in Waco, Texas, William Crush parked two locomotives
at opposite ends of a 6.4-km-long track, fired them up, tied
their throttles open, and then allowed them to crash head-on at
full speed (Fig, 7-1) in front of 30,000 spectators. Hundreds of
people were hurt by flying debris; several were killed.
Assuming each locomotive weighed 1.2 x 10°N and its accel-
eration was a constant 0.26 m/s, what was the total kinetic en-
ergy of the two locomotives just before the collision? os

KEY IDEAS

(1) We need to find the kinetic energy of each locomotive
with Eq. 7-1, but that means we need each locomotive’s
speed just before the collision and its mass. (2) Because we
can assume each locomotive had constant acceleration, we
can use the equations in Table 2-1 to find its speed v just be-
fore the collision.

Calculations: We choose Eq. 2-16 because we know values
for all the variables except v:
Vv = v5 + 2a(x — x9).
With vp = 0 and x — xp = 3.2 X 10? m (half the initial sepa-
ration), this yields
v= = 0 + 2(0.26 m/s*)(3.2 X 10° m),
or v = 40.8 m/s = 147 km/h.

‘We can find the mass of each locomotive by dividing its
given weight by g:
1.2 X 10°N

9.8 m/s*

Now, using Eq. 7-1, we find the total kinetic energy of

the two locomotives just before the collision as
K = 2($mv) = (1.22 x 105 kg)(40.8 m/s)?
= al One (Answer)

This collision was like an exploding bomb.

 

= 1.22 X 105kg.
