154 CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

These statements are known traditionally as the work—kinetic energy theorem
for particles. They hold for both positive and negative work: If the net work done
ona particle is positive, then the particle’s kinetic energy increases by the amount
of the work. If the net work done is negative, then the particle’s kinetic energy
decreases by the amount of the work.

For example, if the kinetic energy of a particle is initially 5 J and there is a
net transfer of 2 J to the particle (positive net work), the final kinetic energy is
7 J. If, instead, there is a net transfer of 2 J from the particle (negative net work),
the final kinetic energy is 3 J.

Iv] Checkpoint 1

A particle moves along an x axis. Does the kinetic energy of the particle increase, de-
crease, or remain the same if the particle’s velocity changes (a) from —3 m/s to —2 m/s
and (b) from —2 m/s to2 m/s? (c) In each situation, is the work done on the particle
positive, negative, or zero?

Sample Problem 7.02 Work done by two constant forces, industrial spies

Figure 7-4a shows two industrial spies sliding an initially
stationary 225 kg floor safe a displacement dof magnitude
8.50 m. The push F; of spy 001 is 12.0 N at an angle of 30.0°
downward from the horizontal; the pull F, of spy 002 is
10.0 N at 40.0° above the horizontal. The magnitudes and di-
rections of these forces do not change as the safe moves, and
the floor and safe make frictionless contact.

(a) Whatis the net work done on the safe by forces F, and Fy
during the displacement d?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The net work W done on the safe by the two forces is the
sum of the works they do individually. (2) Because we can
treat the safe as a particle and the forces are constant in
both magnitude and direction, we can use either Eq. 7-7
(W = Fd cos ¢) or Eq. 7-8 (W = Fd) to calculate those
works. Let’s choose Eq. 7-7.

Calculations: From Eq. 7-7 and the free-body diagram for
the safe in Fig. 7-4b, the work done by F, is

= F,d cos ¢; = (12.0 N)(8.50 m)(cos 30.0°)

= 88.33 J,
and the work done by F)is
W, = Fyd cos ¢) = (10.0 N)(8.50 m)(cos 40.0°)
= 65.115.

Thus, the net work Wis
W= W, + Wy = 88.333 + 65.115
= 153.4J ~ 153]. (Answer)

During the 8.50 m displacement, therefore, the spies transfer
153 J of energy to the kinetic energy of the safe.

Se Only force components

parallel to the displacement
do work.

(b) During the displacement, what is the work W, done on the
safe by the gravitational force F, and what is the work Wy
done on the safe by the normal fea Fy from the floor?

KEY IDEA

Because these forces are constant in both magnitude and
direction, we can find the work they do with Eq.7-7.

Calculations: Thus, with mg as the magnitude of the gravi-
tational force, we write

W, = mgd cos 90° = mgd(0) = (Answer)
Wy = Fyd cos 90° = Fyd(0) = 0. (Answer)
We should have known this result. Because these forces are

perpendicular to the displacement of the safe, they do zero
work on the safe and do not transfer any energy to or from it.

and

(c) The safe is initially stationary. What is its speed v; at the
end of the 8.50 m displacement?

KEY IDEA

 

The speed of the safe changes because its kinetic energy is
changed when energy is transferred to it by F, and F).
