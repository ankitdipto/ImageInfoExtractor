7-3 WORK DONE BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE

Calculations: We relate the speed to the work done by
combining Egs. 7-10 (the work—kinetic energy theorem) and
7-1 (the definition of kinetic energy):

W = Ky K, = 31vj — 3mv.

The initial speed v; is zero, and we now know that the work

done is 153.4 J. Solving for vy and then substituting known
data, we find that

Sample Problem 7.03 Work done by a constant force in unit-vector notation

During a storm, a crate of crepe is sliding across a slick,
oily parking lot through a displacement d = (—3.0 m)i
while a steady wind pushes against the crate with a force
F = (2.0N)i + (-6.0N)j. The situation and coordinate
axes are shown in Fig. 7-5.

(a) How much work does this force do on the crate during
the displacement?

KEY IDEA

 

Because we can treat the crate as a particle and because the
wind force is constant (“steady”) in both magnitude and direc-
tion during the displacement, we can use either Eq. 7-7 (W =
Fa cos #) or Eq. 7-8 (W = Fd) to calculate the work. Since
we know F and d in unit-vector notation, we choose Eq. 7-8.

Calculations: We write
W = F-d = [(2.0N)i + (6.0 N)j] -[(—3.0 m)i].
Of the possible unit-vector dot products, only i+1, j-j, and
k - are nonzero (see Appendix E). Here we obtain
W = (2.0 N)(—3.0 m)i-i + (—6.0 N)(—3.0 m)j
= (-6.0J)(1) + 0= —6.0J. (Answer)

The parallel force component does
negative work, slowing the crate.

crate during displacement d.

 

Thus, the force does a negative 6.0 J of work on the crate, trans-
ferring 6.0 J of energy from the kinetic energy of the crate.

(b) If the crate has a kinetic energy of 10 J at the beginning
of displacement d, what is its kinetic energy at the end of d?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the force does negative work on the crate, it re-
duces the crate’s kinetic energy.

Calculation: Using the work—kinetic energy theorem in
the form of Eq. 7-11, we have
K;=K,;+ W=10J + (-60J) =4.0J. (Answer)

Less kinetic energy means that the crate has been slowed.

Atter reading this module, you should be able to...

7.07 Calculate the work done by the gravitational force
when an object is lifted or lowered.

Key Ideas

@ The work W, done by the gravitational force F, ona
particle-like object of mass m as the object moves through a
displacement d is given by

W, = mgd cos 4,

in which ¢is the angle between F, and d.

@ The work W, done by an applied force as a particle-like
object is either lifted or lowered is related to the work W,

done by the gravitational force and the change AK in the
object's kinetic energy by
AK = K;— K,=W, + W,.
If K; = K;, then the equation reduces to
W, = —-W,,
which tells us that the applied force transfers as much energy
to the object as the gravitational force transfers from it.
