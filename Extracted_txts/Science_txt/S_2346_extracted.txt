7-3 WORK DONE BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE

157

If the displacement is vertically downward (Fig. 7-7b), then ¢ = 0° and the work

done by the applied force equals —mgd.

Equations 7-16 and 7-17 apply to any situation in which an object is lifted or
lowered, with the object stationary before and after the lift. They are independent
of the magnitude of the force used. For example, if you lift a mug from the floor
to over your head, your force on the mug varies considerably during the lift. Still,
because the mug is stationary before and after the lift, the work your force does
on the mug is given by Eqs. 7-16 and 7-17, where, in Eq. 7-17, mg is the weight of

the mug and d is the distance you lift it.

Sample Problem 7.04 Work in pulling a sleigh up a snowy slope

In this problem an object is pulled along a ramp but the ob-
ject starts and ends at rest and thus has no overall change in
its kinetic energy (that is important). Figure 7-8a shows the
situation. A rope pulls a 200 kg sleigh (which you may know)
up aslope at incline angle @ = 30°, through distance d = 20 m.
The sleigh and its contents have a total mass of 200 kg. The
snowy slope is so slippery that we take it to be frictionless.
How much work is done by each force acting on the sleigh?

KEY IDEAS

(1) During the motion, the forces are constant in magnitude
and direction and thus we can calculate the work done by
each with Eq. 7-7 (W = Fd cos ¢) in which ¢ is the angle be-
tween the force and the displacement. We reach the same
result with Eq. 7-8 (W = F- d)i in which we take a dot prod-
uct of the force vector and displacement vector. (2) We can
relate the net work done by the forces to the change in
kinetic energy (or lack of a change, as here) with the
work-kinetic energy theorem of Eq.7-10 (AK = W).

Calculations: The first thing to do with most physics prob-
lems involving forces is to draw a free-body diagram to organ-
ize our thoughts. For the sleigh, Fig.7-8 is our free-body dia-
gram, showing the gravitational force i. the force T from the
rope, and the normal force Fy from the ones

Work Wy by the normal force. Let’s start with this easy cal-
culation. The normal force is perpendicular to the slope and
thus also to the sleigh’s displacement. Thus the normal force
does not affect the sleigh’s motion and does zero work. To
be more formal, we can apply Eq. 7-7 to write

Wy = Fyd cos 90° = 0. (Answer)

Work W, by the gravitational force. We can find the work
done by the gravitational force in either of two ways (you
pick the more appealing way). From an earlier discussion
about ramps (Sample Problem 5.04 and Fig. 5-15), we know
that the component of the gravitational force along the
slope has magnitude mg sin @ and is directed down the
slope. Thus the magnitude is

F, = mg sin 6 = (200 kg)(9.8 m/s’) sin 30°
= 980 N.

The angle ¢ between the displacement and this force com-
ponent is 180°. So we can apply Eq. 7-7 to write

= Fad cos 180° = (980 N)(20.m)(—1)
=-1.96 x 1045. (Answer)

The negative result means that the gravitational force re-
moves energy from the sleigh.

The second (equivalent) way to get this result is to use
the full gravitational force F, instead of a component. The
angle between F, and d is 120° (add the incline angle 30°
to 90°). So, Eq. 7- ee

W, = Fd cos 120° = mgd cos 120°
= (200 kg)(9.8 m/s”)(20 m) cos 120°
=-1.96 x 10°. (Answer)

Work W, by the rope’s force. We have two ways of calculat-
ing this work. The quickest way is to use the work—kinetic en-
ergy theorem of Eq. 7-10 (AK = W), where the net work W
done by the forces is Wy + W, + Wrand the change AK in the
kinetic energy is just zero (because the initial and final kinetic
energies are the same—namely, zero). So, Eq. 7-10 gives us

0 = Wy + We + Wr=0- 1.96 x 1043 + Wr
and Wr = 1.96 x 104J. (Answer)
