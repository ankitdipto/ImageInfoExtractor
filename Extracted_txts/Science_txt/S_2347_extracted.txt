158 CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

Instead of doing this, we can apply Newton’s second law for
motion along the x axis to find the magnitude F; of the rope’s
force. Assuming that the acceleration along the slope is zero
(except for the brief starting and stopping), we can write

Foot = MA,
Fy, — mg sin 30° = m(0),
to find
Fr =mgsin 30°.

Sample Problem 7.05 Work done on an accelerating elevator cab

An elevator cab of mass m = 500 kg is descending with speed
v; = 4.0 m/s when its supporting cable begins to slip, allowing
it to fall with constant acceleration @ = g/5 (Fig. 7-9a).

(a) During the fall through a distance d = 12 m, what is the
work W, done on the cab by the gravitational force Fp

KEY IDEA

 

‘We can treat the cab as a particle and thus use Eq. 7-12
(W, = mgd cos ¢) to find the work W,.

Calculation: From Fig. 7-9b, we see that the angle between
the directions of F, and the cab’s displacement d is 0°. So,
W, = mgd cos 0° = (500 kg)(9.8 m/s?)(12 m)(1)

= 5.88 X 104J ~ 59 kJ. (Answer)
(b) During the 12 m fall, what is the work Wy done on the
cab by the upward pull T of the elevator cable?
KEY IDEA
We can calculate work W; with Eq. 7-7 (W = Fd cos #) by
first writing F,... = may, for the components in Fig. 7-9b.
Calculations: We get

Si eel TILES

Solving for T, substituting mg for
the result in Eq. 7-7, we obtain

W,= Tdcos 6=m(a + g)dcos ¢.

F,, and then substituting

(7-19)

Next, substituting —g/5 for the (downward) acceleration a
and then 180° for the angle ¢@ between the directions of
forces T and mg, we find

Wr= m(—£ + 2) dcos $= Liga cos 6

ais) (500 kg)(9.8 m/s?)(12 m) cos 180°

= —4.70 x 104J = —47kJ. (Answer)

This is the magnitude. Because the force and the displace-
ment are both up the slope, the angle between those two
vectors is zero. So, we can now write Eq. 7-7 to find the work
done by the rope’s force:

W,= Frd cos 0° = (mg sin 30°)d cos 0°
= (200kg)(9.8 m/s*)(sin 30°)(20 m) cos 0°

= 1.96 x 1045. (Answer)

(a) (d)

Caution: Note that W; is not simply the negative of W, be-
cause the cab accelerates during the fall. Thus, Eq. 7-16
(which assumes that the initial and final kinetic energies are
equal) does not apply here.

(c) What is the net work W done on the cab during the fall?
Calculation: The net work is the sum of the works done by
the forces acting on the cab:
W=W, + Wr=5.88 x 1043 — 4.70 x 1043
= 118 x 104*J ~ 12k). (Answer)
(d) What is the cab’s kinetic energy at the end of the 12 m fall?

KEY IDEA

 

The kinetic energy changes because of the net work done on
the cab, according to Eq.7-11 (K; = K; + W).

Calculation: From Eq. 7-1, we write the initial kinetic
energy as K; amv}. We then write Eq. 7-11 as
K; = K, + W =3mv7 + W
= $(500 kg)(4.0 m/s)? + 1.18 x 104

= 158 x 10*J ~ 16 KJ. (Answer)
