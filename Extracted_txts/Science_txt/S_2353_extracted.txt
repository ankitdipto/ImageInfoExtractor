CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

The work W done by F while the particle moves from an initial position r; having
coordinates (x;, y;, Z) to a final position rhaving coordinates (x;,y;,Z,) is then

If F has only an x component, then the y and z terms in Eq. 7-36 are zero and the
equation reduces to Eq. 7-32.

Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem with a Variable Force

Equation 7-32 gives the work done by a variable force on a particle in a one-
dimensional situation. Let us now make certain that the work is equal to the
change in kinetic energy, as the work—kinetic energy theorem states.

Consider a particle of mass m, moving along an x axis and acted on by a
net force F(x) that is directed along that axis. The work done on the particle
by this force as the particle moves from position x; to position x; is given by
Eq. 7-32 as

we [ “F(x dx = [ ma dx, (7-37)

in which we use Newton’s second law to replace F(x) with ma. We can write the
quantity ma dx in Eq.7-37 as
dv
dx = m—~ dx. 7-38,
ma dx = m— dx. (7-38)
From the chain rule of calculus, we have

dv dv dx dv

“a dx dt de” (7-39)

and Eq. 7-38 becomes

ma dx =m * vdx =mvav. (7-40)
x

Substituting Eq. 7-40 into Eq. 7-37 yields

Note that when we change the variable from x to v we are required to express the
limits on the integral in terms of the new variable. Note also that because the
mass mis aconstant, we are able to move it outside the integral.
Recognizing the terms on the right side of Eq. 7-41 as kinetic energies allows
us to write this equation as
W = K;— K;=AK,

which is the work—kinetic energy theorem.
