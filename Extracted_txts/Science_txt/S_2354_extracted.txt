7-5 WORK DONE BY A GENERAL VARIABLE FORCE

(Note that this latter value is displayed as —20 N.) The
block’s kinetic energy at x, is K,; = 280 J. What is the
block’s speed at x; = 0,7 = 4.0m, and x; = 6.5 m?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) At any point, we can relate the speed of the block to its
kinetic energy with Eq. 7-1 (K = }mv). (2) We can relate
the kinetic energy K; at a later point to the initial kinetic K;
and the work W done on the block by using the work—
kinetic energy theorem of Eq. 7-10 (K; — K;= W). (3) We
can calculate the work W done by a variable force F(x) by
integrating the force versus position x. Equation 7-32 tells
us that

we | Fax)ax.

We don’t have a function F(x) to carry out the integration,
but we do have a graph of F(x) where we can integrate by
finding the area between the plotted line and the x axis.
Where the plot is above the axis, the work (which is equal to
the area) is positive. Where it is below the axis, the work is
negative.

Calculations: The requested speed at x = 0 is easy because
we already know the kinetic energy. So, we just plug the
kinetic energy into the formula for kinetic energy:

K, = nv,
280 J = 38.0 kg)v7,
and then

v, = 8.37 m/s ~ 8.4 m/s. (Answer)

As the block moves from x = 0 to x = 4.0 m, the plot in
Figure 7-13a is above the x axis, which means that positive
work is being done on the block. We split the area under the
plot into a triangle at the left, a rectangle in the center, anda
triangle at the right. Their total area is

3(40 N)(1 m) + (40 N)(2 m) + 5(40N)( m) = 120N-m
= 120J.

This means that between x = 0 and x = 4.0 m, the force
does 120 J of work on the block, increasing the kinetic en-
ergy and speed of the block. So, when the block reaches
x = 4.0 m, the work-kinetic energy theorem tells us that
the kinetic energy is

Kk, =K,+W

= 280J + 120J = 400J.

Again using the definition of kinetic energy, we find

Ky = 5mv3,

400 J = $(8.0 kg)v3,

and then

v, = 10 mis. (Answer)
This is the block’s greatest speed because from x = 4.0 m to
x = 6.5 m the force is negative, meaning that it opposes the
block’s motion, doing negative work on the block and thus
decreasing the kinetic energy and speed. In that range, the
area between the plot and the x axis is

3(20 N)(1 m) + (20 N)(1 m) + 5(20N)(0.5 m) = 35 N-m
= 35J.
This means that the work done by the force in that range is
—35 J. At x = 4.0, the block has K = 400 J. At x = 6.5 m, the
work—kinetic energy theorem tells us that its kinetic energy is
K,=K,+W
= 400J — 35J = 365 J.

Again using the definition of kinetic energy, we find

Kz = ynv3,

365 J = 3(8.0 kg)v3,

and then

v3 = 9.55 m/s ~ 9.6 m/s. (Answer)

The block is still moving in the positive direction of the
x axis, a bit faster than initially.
