166 CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

Sample Problem 7.08 Work, two-dimensional integration

When the force on an object depends on the position of the
object, we cannot find the work done by it on the object by
simply multiplying the force by the displacement. The rea-
son is that there is no one value for the force—it changes.
So, we must find the work in tiny little displacements and
then add up all the work results. We effectively say, “Yes, the
force varies over any given tiny little displacement, but the
variation is so small we can approximate the force as being
constant during the displacement.” Sure, it is not precise, but
if we make the displacements infinitesimal, then our error
becomes infinitesimal and the result becomes precise. But,
to add an infinite number of work contributions by hand
would take us forever, longer than a semester. So, we add
them up via an integration, which allows us to do all this in
minutes (much less than a semester).

Force F = (3x2N)i + (4 N)j, with x in meters, acts on a
particle, changing only the kinetic energy of the particle.
How much work is done on the particle as it moves from co-
ordinates (2 m, 3m) to (3m, 0 m)? Does the speed of the
particle increase, decrease, or remain the same?

KEY IDEA

The force is a variable force because its x component de-
pends on the value of x. Thus, we cannot use Eqs. 7-7 and 7-8
to find the work done. Instead, we must use Eq. 7-36 to inte-
grate the force.

Calculation: We set up two integrals, one along each axis:

3 0 3 0
w= [seat [sa =3[eac+a{ dy
2 3 2 3

= 3fhe]} + 4[y] =F - 2] + 4f0 ~ 3]

=704. (Answer)

The positive result means that energy is transferred to the
particle by force F. Thus, the kinetic energy of the particle
increases and, because K = 3mv?, its speed must also
increase. If the work had come out negative, the kinetic
energy and speed would have decreased.

Learning Objectives

 

After reading this module, you should be able to...

7.18 Apply the relationship between average power, the
work done by a force, and the time interval in which that
work is done.

7.19 Given the work as a function of time, find the instanta-
neous power.

Key Ideas

@ The power due to a force is the rate at which that force
does work on an object.

@ If the force does work W during a time interval Af, the aver-
age power due to the force over that time interval is

Ww

Pay =

7.20 Determine the instantaneous power by taking a dot
product of the force vector and an object's velocity vector,
in magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations.

@ Instantaneous power is the instantaneous rate of doing work:
dw
P=—.
dt
@ Fora force F at an angle ¢ to the direction of travel of the
instantaneous velocity V, the instantaneous power is

P= Froos$=F°v¥.

 

Power

The time rate at which work is done by a force is said to be the power due to the
force. If a force does an amount of work W in an amount of time Af, the average
power due to the force during that time interval is

Ww
Pave = yp (7-42)

(average power).
