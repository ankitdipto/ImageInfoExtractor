The instantaneous power P is the instantaneous time rate of doing work, which
we can write as

dw
P= a (instantaneous power). (7-43)

Suppose we know the work W(t) done by a force as a function of time. Then to
get the instantaneous power P at, say, time ¢ = 3.0 s during the work, we would
first take the time derivative of W(t) and then evaluate the result for t = 3.0 s.

The SI unit of power is the joule per second. This unit is used so often that it
has a special name, the watt (W), after James Watt, who greatly improved the
rate at which steam engines could do work. In the British system, the unit of
power is the foot-pound per second. Often the horsepower is used. These are
related by

watt = 1 W = 1 J/s = 0.738 ft -lb/s (7-44)
and 1 horsepower = 1 hp = 550 ft -Ib/s = 746 W. (745)

Inspection of Eq. 7-42 shows that work can be expressed as power multiplied
by time, as in the common unit kilowatt-hour. Thus,

1 kilowatt-hour = 1 kW-h = (10? W)(3600 s)
= 3.60 X 10° J = 3.60 MI. (7-46)

Perhaps because they appear on our utility bills, the watt and the kilowatt-hour
have become identified as electrical units. They can be used equally well as units
for other examples of power and energy. Thus, if you pick up a book from the
floor and put it on a tabletop, you are free to report the work that you have done
as, say,4 X 10~° kW -h (or more conveniently as 4 mW -h).

We can also express the rate at which a force does work on a particle (or
particle-like object) in terms of that force and the particle’s velocity. For a par-
ticle that is moving along a straight line (say, an x axis) and is acted on by a
constant force F directed at some angle ¢ to that line, Eq.7-43 becomes

_ dW _ Foos¢dx _ dx
P= dt dt = Feos o(

or P = Fvcos ¢. (747)

Reorganizing the right side of Eq. 7-47 as the dot product F' 7, we may also write
the equation as

P=F-V (instantaneous power). (7-48)

For example, the truck in Fig. 7-14 exerts a force F onthe trailing load, which
has velocity ¥ at some instant. The instantaneous power due to F is the rate at
which F does work on the load at that instant and is given by Eqs. 7-47 and 7-48.
Saying that this power is “the power of the truck” is often acceptable, but keep in
mind what is meant: Power is the rate at which the applied force does work.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

A block moves with uniform circular motion because a cord tied to the block is an-
chored at the center of a circle. Is the power due to the force on the block from the
cord positive, negative, or zero?

applied force on the trailing load is the
rate at which that force does work on the
load.
