Spring Force The force F, from a spring is

F=—kd — (Hooke’s law), (7-20)

where d is the displacement of the spring’s free end from its posi-
tion when the spring is in its relaxed state (neither compressed nor
extended), and k is the spring constant (a measure of the spring’s
stiffness). If an x axis lies along the spring, with the origin at the lo-
cation of the spring’s free end when the spring is in its relaxed
state, Eq. 7-20 can be written as

F,=—kx — (Hooke’s law).

 

 

(7-21)

A spring force is thus a variable force: It varies with the
displacement of the spring’s free end.

Work Done by a Spring Force If an object is attached to
the spring's free end, the work W, done on the object by the spring
force when the object is moved from an initial position ¥; to a final
position x;is

= hkx? — $kx?. (7-25)
If x; = 0 and x; = x, then Eq. 7-25 becomes
W, = -3ke. (7-26)

Work Done by a Variable Force Whenthe force F ona particle-
like object depends on the position of the object, the work done by F
on the object while the object moves from an initial position r; with co-
ordinates (x;, y;, Z;) to a final position r; with coordinates (x;, y,, Z))

1 Rank the following velocities according to the kinetic energy a
particle will have with each velocity, greatest first: (av v=4i+ 3).
(b) ¥ = —4i + 3), (c) V= -31 + 4j, (d) ¥ = 31 — 4j, (0) V = Si,

2 Figure 7-16a shows two horizontal forces that act on a block
that is sliding to the right across a frictionless floor. Figure 7-16b
shows three plots of the block’s kinetic energy K versus time ft.
Which of the plots best corresponds to the following three situ-
ations: (a) F; = Fy,(b) F; > Fy, (c) Fy < Fy?

ticle during a straight-line displacement d if (a) the angle between F
and d is 30°; (b) the angle is 100°; (c) F = 21 — 3) andd = —4i?

4 Inthree situations, a briefly applied horizontal force changes the
velocity of a hockey puck that slides over frictionless ice. The over-
head views of Fig. 7-17 indicate, for each situation, the puck’s initial
speed v;,its final speed v,, and the directions of the corresponding ve-
locity vectors. Rank the situations according to the work done on the
puck by the applied force, most positive first and most negative last.

must be found by integrating the force. If we assume that component
F, may depend on x but not on y or z, component F, may depend on y
but not on x or z,and component F, may depend on z but not on x or
y, then the work is

W=| F.dx+ I Fy dy + I F.dz. (7-36)
If Fhas only an.x component, then Eq. 7-36 reduces to
W= I F(x) dx. (7-32)

Power The power due to a force is the rate at which that force
does work on an object. If the force does work W during a time inter-
val At, the average power due to the force over that time interval is

Instantaneous power is the instantaneous rate of doing work:

For a force F at an angle ¢ to the direction of travel of the instan-
taneous velocity V, the instantaneous power is
