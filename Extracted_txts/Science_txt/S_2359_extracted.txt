ponent F, of a force that can act Fr
on a particle. If the particle be- ‘
gins at rest at x = 0, what is its x x(m)
coordinate when it has (a) its 123 8
greatest kinetic energy, (b) its -#A
greatest speed, and (c) zero A

speed? (d) What is the particle’s
direction of travel after it
reaches x = 6m?

along which to slide to the ground. Rank the slides according to how
much work the gravitational force does on the pig during the descent,
greatest first.

11 In three situations, a single force acts on a moving particle.

Here are the velocities (at that instant) and the forces:
(1) 7 = (-4i) ms, F = (61 — 20))N; (2) = (2i—3}) ms,
F = (—2j + 7k) N; (3) ¥ = (-3i + j) m/s, F = (2i + 6) N. Rank
the situations according to the rate at which energy is being trans-
ferred, greatest transfer to the particle ranked first, greatest trans-
fer from the particle ranked last.

    

12 Figure 7-23 shows three arrangements of a block attached to
identical springs that are in their relaxed state when the block is
centered as shown. Rank the arrangements according to the mag-
nitude of the net force on the block, largest first, when the block is
displaced by distance d (a) to the right and (b) to the left. Rank the
arrangements according to the work done on the block by the
spring forces, greatest first, when the block is displaced by d (c) to
the right and (d) to the left.

Module7-1 Kinetic Energy

*1 ssm A proton (mass m = 1.67 X 10-7’ kg) is being acceler-
ated along a straight line at 3.6 x 1045 m/s*in a machine. If the pro-
ton has an initial speed of 2.4 x 107 m/s and travels 3.5 cm, what
then is (a) its speed and (b) the increase in its kinetic energy?

°2 Ifa Saturn V rocket with an Apollo spacecraft attached had a
combined mass of 2.9 X 105kg and reached a speed of 11.2 km/s,
how much kinetic energy would it then have?
