much like a stone skipped across water. The accompanying fireball
was so bright that it could be seen in the daytime sky and was
brighter than the usual meteorite trail. The meteorite’s mass was
about 4 X 10° kg; its speed was about 15 km/s. Had it entered the
atmosphere vertically, it would have hit Earth’s surface with about
the same speed. (a) Calculate the meteorite’s loss of kinetic energy
(in joules) that would have been associated with the vertical impact.
(b) Express the energy as a multiple of the explosive energy of
1 megaton of TNT, which is 4.2 x 10'5 J. (c) The energy associated
with the atomic bomb explosion over Hiroshima was equivalent to
13 kilotons of TNT. To how many Hiroshima bombs would the me-
teorite impact have been equivalent?

°4 ASS An explosion at ground level leaves a crater with a diam-
eter that is proportional to the energy of the explosion raised to
the } power; an explosion of 1 megaton of TNT leaves a crater
with a 1 km diameter. Below Lake Huron in Michigan there ap-
pears to be an ancient impact crater with a 50 km diameter. What
was the kinetic energy associated with that impact, in terms of
(a) megatons of TNT (1 megaton yields 4.2 x 10'J) and
(b) Hiroshima bomb equivalents (13 kilotons of TNT each)?
(Ancient meteorite or comet impacts may have significantly
altered the climate, killing off the dinosaurs and other life-forms.)

**5 A father racing his son has half the kinetic energy of the son,
who has half the mass of the father. The father speeds up by 1.0 m/s
and then has the same kinetic energy as the son. What are the origi-
nal speeds of (a) the father and (b) the son?

“6 A bead with mass 1.8 X 10-2 kg is moving along a wire in
the positive direction of an x axis. Beginning at time ¢ = 0, when
the bead passes through x = 0 with speed 12 m/s, a constant force
acts on the bead. Figure 7-24 indicates the bead’s position at
these four times: fy = 0, t; = 1.0 s, h = 2.0 s, and t; = 3.0s. The
bead momentarily stops at tf = 3.0 s. What is the kinetic energy of
the bead at f = 10 s?

*7 +A 3.0kg body is at rest on a frictionless horizontal air track
when a constant horizontal force F acting in the positive direction of
an x axis along the track is applied to the body. A stroboscopic graph
of the position of the body as it slides to the right is shown in Fig. 7-

the position of the body at 0.50s intervals. How much work is done
on the body by the applied force F between t = Oandt = 2.0s?

*8 A ice block floating in a river is pushed through a displacement
d = (15 m)i — (12 m)j along a straight embankment by rushing wa-
ter, which exerts a force F = (210 N)i — (150 N)j on the block. How
much work does the force do on the block during the displacement?

°9 The only force acting on a 2.0 kg canister that is moving in an
xy plane has a magnitude of 5.0 N. The canister initially has a veloc-

velocity of 6.0 m/s in the positive y direction. How much work is
done on the canister by the 5.0 N force during this time?

*10 A coin slides over a frictionless plane and across an xy
coordinate system from the origin to a point with xy coordinates
(3.0 m, 4.0 m) while a constant force acts on it. The force has mag-
nitude 2.0 N and is directed at a counterclockwise angle of 100°
from the positive direction of the x axis. How much work is done
by the force on the coin during the displacement?

tween the force and the displacement if the change in the particle’s
kinetic energy is (a) +30.0 J and (b) —30.0 J?

of 37 m/s. If a force slows them to a stop at a constant rate of 2.0
m/s, (a) what magnitude F is required for the force, (b) what dis-
tance d do they travel while slowing, and (c) what work W is done

stead, slow at 4.0 m/s*?
