Module 7-3 Work Done by
the Gravitational Force

°17 ssm www A helicopter lifts a 72 kg astronaut 15 m verti-
cally from the ocean by means of a cable. The acceleration of the
astronaut is g/10. How much work is done on the astronaut by
(a) the force from the helicopter and (b) the gravitational force on
her? Just before she reaches the helicopter, what are her (c) kinetic
energy and (d) speed?

°18 <%= (a) In 1975 the roof of Montreal's Velodrome, with
a weight of 360 KN, was lifted by 10 cm so that it could be centered.
How much work was done on the roof by the forces making the
lift? (b) In 1960 a Tampa, Florida, mother reportedly raised one
end of a car that had fallen onto her son when a jack failed. If her
panic lift effectively raised 4000 N (about } of the car’s weight) by
5.0 cm, how much work did her force do on the car?

through distance d = 0.50 m along the
ramp, its kinetic energy increases by 80
J. How much greater would its kinetic
energy have been if the rope had not
been attached to the block?

*20 A block is sent up a frictionless
ramp along which an x axis extends up-
ward. Figure 7-31 gives the kinetic en-
ergy of the block as a function of posi-
tion x; the scale of the figure’s vertical
axis is set by K, = 40.0 J. If the block’s
initial speed is 4.00 m/s, what is the nor-
mal force on the block?

21 ssM A cord is used to vertically

lower an initially stationary block of

mass M at a constant downward acceleration of g/4. When the block
has fallen a distance d, find (a) the work done by the cord’s force on
the block, (b) the work done by the gravitational force on the block,
(c) the kinetic energy of the block, and (d) the speed of the block.

22 A cave rescue team lifts an injured spelunker directly upward
and out of a sinkhole by means of a motor-driven cable. The lift is
performed in three stages, each requiring a vertical distance of 10.0
m: (a) the initially stationary spelunker is accelerated to a speed of
5.00 m/s; (b) he is then lifted at the con-

stant speed of 5.00 m/s; (c) finally he is

decelerated to zero speed. How much

work is done on the 80.0 kg rescuee by

the force lifting him during each stage? $

Module 7-4 Work Done by a Spring Force

26 In Fig. 7-10, we must apply a force of magnitude 80 N to hold the
block stationary at x = —2.0 cm. From that position, we then slowly
move the block so that our force does +4.0J of work on the
spring—block system; the block is then again stationary. What is the
block’s position? (Hint:There are two answers.)

+27 A spring and block are in the arrangement of Fig, 7-10. When the
block is pulled out tox = +4.0 cm, we must apply a force of magnitude.
360 N to hold it there. We pull the block tox = 11 cm and then release
it. How much work does the spring do on the block as the block
moves from x; = +5.0cm to (a) x = +3.0.cm, (b) x = —3.0cm,
(c) x = —5.0 cm, and (d).x = —9.0 cm?

+28 During spring semester at MIT, residents of the parallel build-
ings of the East Campus dorms battle one another with large cata-
pults that are made with surgical hose mounted on a window frame.
A balloon filled with dyed water is placed in a pouch attached to the
hose, which is then stretched through the width of the room. Assume,
that the stretching of the hose obeys Hooke’s law with a spring con-
stant of 100 N/m. If the hose is stretched by 5.00 m and then released,
how much work does the force from the hose do on the balloon in
the pouch by the time the hose reaches its relaxed length?

29 In the arrangement of Fig, 7-10, we gradually pull the block
from x = 0 to x = +3.0 cm, where it is stationary. Figure 7-35 gives
