moves along a positive x axis has an x component F, = —6x N,
with x in meters. The velocity at x = 3.0 m is 8.0 m/s. (a) What is the
velocity of the body at x = 4.0 m? (b) At what positive value of x

33 @ The block in Fig. 7-102 lies on a horizontal frictionless
surface, and the spring constant is 50 N/m. Initially, the spring is at
its relaxed length and the block is stationary at position x = 0.
Then an applied force with a constant magnitude of 3.0 N pulls the
block in the positive direction of the x axis, stretching the spring
until the block stops. When that stopping point is reached, what are
(a) the position of the block, (b) the work that has been done on
the block by the applied force, and (c) the work that has been done
on the block by the spring force? During the block’s displacement,
what are (d) the block’s position when its kinetic energy is maxi-
mum and (e) the value of that maximum kinetic energy?
