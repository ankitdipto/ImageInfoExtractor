174 CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

end of the cord is pulled over a pulley, of negligible mass and friction
and at cord height A = 1.20 m, so the cart slides from x; = 3.00 m to
X2 = 1.00 m. During the move, the tension in the cord is a constant
25.0 N. What is the change in the kinetic energy of the cart during
the move?

and (c) the third seconds and (d) the instantaneous power due to
the force at the end of the third second.

44 A skier is pulled by a towrope up a frictionless ski slope
that makes an angle of 12° with the horizontal. The rope moves
parallel to the slope with a constant speed of 1.0 m/s. The force
of the rope does 900 J of work on the skier as the skier moves a
distance of 8.0 m up the incline. (a) If the rope moved with a
constant speed of 2.0 m/s, how much work would the force of the
rope do on the skier as the skier moved a distance of 8.0 m up
the incline? At what rate is the force of the rope doing work on
the skier when the rope moves with a speed of (b) 1.0 m/s and
(c) 2.0 m/s?

*45 SSM ILW A 100kg block is pulled at a constant speed of
5.0 m/s across a horizontal floor by an applied force of 122 N di-
rected 37° above the horizontal. What is the rate at which the force
does work on the block?

°46 The loaded cab of an elevator has a mass of 3.0 X 10° kg and
moves 210 m up the shaft in 23 s at constant speed. At what aver-
age rate does the force from the cable do work on the cab?

+47 A machine carries a 4.0 kg package from an initial position
of d, = 0.50m)i + (0.75 m)j + (0.20 m)k at ¢ = 0 to a final posi-
tion of dy= (7.50 m)i + (12.0 m)j + (720m) at = 12s. The
Sonstant force applied by the machine on the package is

= (2.00 N)i + (4.00N)j + (6.00 N)k. For that displacement,
find (a) the work done on the package by the machine’s force and
(b) the average power of the machine’s force on the package.

°°48 A 0.30 kg ladle sliding on a horizontal frictionless surface is
attached to one end of a horizontal spring (k = 500 N/m) whose
other end is fixed. The ladle has a kinetic energy of 10J as it
passes through its equilibrium position (the point at which the
spring force is zero). (a) At what rate is the spring doing work on
the ladle as the ladle passes through its equilibrium position?
(b) At what rate is the spring doing work on the ladle when the
spring is compressed 0.10 m and the ladle is moving away from the
equilibrium position?

 

+49 SSM A fully loaded, slow-moving freight elevator has a cab
with a total mass of 1200 kg, which is required to travel upward
54 m in 3.0 min, starting and ending at rest. The elevator’s counter-
weight has a mass of only 950 kg, and so the elevator motor must
help. What average power is required of the force the motor exerts
on the cab via the cable?

°e50 (a) Ata certain instant, a particle-like object is acted on by a
force F = (4.0 N)i ~ (2.0 N)j + (9.0 N)k while the object's veloc-
ity is ¥ = —(2.0 m/s)i + (4.0 m/s)k. What is the instantaneous rate
at which the force does work on the object? (b) At some other
time, the velocity consists of only a y component. If the force is un-
changed and the instantaneous power is —12 W, what is the veloc-
ity of the object?

#51 A force F = (3.00N)i + (7.00N)j + (7.00N)k acts on a
2.00kg mobile object that moves from an initial position of

 
 

d@ = (3.00 m)i ~ (2.00 m)j + (5.00m)k to a final position of
a= = —(5.00 m)i + (4.00 m)j + (7.00 m)k in 4.00s. Find (a) the
work done on the object by the force in the 4.00 s interval, (b) the
average power due to the force during that interval, and (c) the an-
gle between vectors d,and dy.

distance in time T with the engine operating at a constant power P.

amount dP, what is the change in the time required for the run?
