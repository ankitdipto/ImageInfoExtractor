crate, and (d) the work done by the pull on the crate from the rope?
(e) Knowing that the crate is motionless before and after its displace-
ment, use the answers to (b), (c), and (d) to find the work your force
F does on the crate. (f) Why is the work of your force not equal to
the product of the horizontal displacement and the answer to (a)?

58 To pull a 50 kg crate across a horizontal frictionless floor, a
worker applies a force of 210 N, directed 20° above the horizontal.

worker’s force, (b) the gravitational force, and (c) the normal force?
(d) What is the total work?

59 A force F, is applied to a bead as
the bead is moved along a straight wire
through displacement +5.0 cm. The mag-
nitude of F, is set at a certain value, but
the angle @ between F, and the bead’s

displacement can be chosen. Figure 7-45 0

64° and (b) 147°?

60 A frightened child is restrained by her mother as the child slides
down a frictionless playground slide. If the force on the child from the
mother is 100 N up the slide, the child’s kinetic energy increases by 30 J
as she moves down the slide a distance of 1.8 m. (a) How much work is
done on the child by the gravitational force during the 1.8 m descent?
(b) If the child is not restrained by her mother, how much will the
child’s kinetic energy increase as she comes down the slide that same
distance of 1.8 m?

61 How much work is done by a force F = (2x N)i + (3 Nj,
with x in meters, that moves a particle from a position 7; =
(2m)i + (3 m)j toa position 7, = —(4m)i — (3 m)j?

62 A 250 g block is dropped onto a relaxed ver-
tical spring that has a spring constant of k =
2.5 Nicm (Fig. 7-46). The block becomes attached to
the spring and compresses the spring 12cm before
momentarily stopping. While the spring is being
compressed, what work is done on the block by
(a) the gravitational force on it and (b) the spring
force? (c) What is the speed of the block just before
it hits the spring? (Assume that friction is negligi-
ble.) (d) If the speed at impact is doubled, what is
the maximum compression of the spring?

63 SSM To push a 25.0 kg crate up a frictionless

incline, angled at 25.0° to the horizontal, a worker exerts a force of
209 N parallel to the incline. As the crate slides 1.50 m, how much
work is done on the crate by (a) the worker’s applied force, (b) the
gravitational force on the crate, and (c) the normal force exerted
by the incline on the crate? (d) What is the total work done on the
crate?

64 Boxes are transported from one location to another in a ware-
house by means of a conveyor belt that moves with a constant
speed of 0.50 m/s. At a certain location the conveyor belt moves for
2.0 m up an incline that makes an angle of 10° with the horizontal,
then for 2.0m horizontally, and finally for 2.0m down an incline
that makes an angle of 10° with the horizontal. Assume that a 2.0 kg
box rides on the belt without slipping. At what rate is the force of
the conveyor belt doing work on the box as the box moves (a) up
the 10° incline, (b) horizontally, and (c) down the 10° incline?

65 In Fig. 7-47, a cord runs around
two massless, frictionless pulleys. A
canister with mass m = 20 kg hangs
from one pulley, and you exert a
force F on the free end of the cord,
(a) What must be the magnitude of F
if you are to lift the canister at a con-
stant speed? (b) To lift the canister
by 2.0 cm, how far must you pull the
free end of the cord? During that lift,
what is the work done on the canister
by (c) your force (via the cord) and
(d) the gravitational force? (Hint:
When a cord loops around a pulley
as shown, it pulls on the pulley with a
net force that is twice the tension in the cord.)

67 ssm A spring with a pointer attached is hanging next to a
scale marked in millimeters. Three different packages are hung
from the spring, in turn, as shown in Fig. 7-48. (a) Which mark on

the spring? (b) What is the weight W of the third package?

68 Aniceboat is at rest on a frictionless frozen lake when a sud-
den wind exerts a constant force of 200 N, toward the east, on the
boat. Due to the angle of the sail, the wind causes the boat to
slide in a straight line for a distance of 8.0 m in a direction 20°
north of east. What is the kinetic energy of the iceboat at the end
of that 8.0 m?

goes through displacement d = (3.0 m)i — (2.0 m)j. (Other forces
also act on the particle.) What is c if the work done on the particle
by force F is (a) 0,(b) 17 J,and (c) —18 J?

71 A constant force of magnitude 10 N makes an angle of 150°

on the object by the force as the object moves from the origin to
the point having position vector (2.0m)i — (4.0 m)j?
