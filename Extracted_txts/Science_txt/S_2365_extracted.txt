176 CHAPTER 7 KINETIC ENERGY AND WORK

72 In Fig. 7-49a, a 2.0N force is applied to a 4.0 kg block at a
downward angle @ as the block moves rightward through 1.0 m
across a frictionless floor. Find an expression for the speed v, of the
block at the end of that distance if the block’s initial velocity is
(a) 0 and (b) 1.0 m/s to the right. (c) The situation in Fig. 7-49b is
similar in that the block is initially moving at 1.0 m/s to the right,
but now the 2.0 N force is directed downward to the left. Find an
expression for the speed v; of the block at the end of the 1.0 m dis-
tance. (d) Graph all three expressions for v; versus downward
angle @for @ = 0° to @ = 90°. Interpret the graphs.

73 A force F in the positive direction of an x axis acts on an object
moving along the axis. If the magnitude of the force is F = 10e-**°
N, with x in meters, find the work done by F as the object moves
from x = 0 to x = 2.0 m by (a) plotting F(x) and estimating the area
under the curve and (b) integrating to find the work analytically.

a A particle moves along a straight path through displacement

= (8m)i + g while force F = (2 N)i — (4N)j acts on it. (Other
forse also act on the particle.) What is the value of c if the work
done by F on the particle is (a) zero, (b) positive, and (c) negative?
75 SSM What is the power of the force required to move a 4500
kg elevator cab with a load of 1800 kg upward at constant speed
3.80 m/s?

76 A 45kg block of ice slides down a frictionless incline 1.5 m
long and 0.91 m high. A worker pushes up against the ice, parallel
to the incline, so that the block slides down at constant speed.
(a) Find the magnitude of the worker's force. How much work is
done on the block by (b) the worker's force, (c) the gravitational
force on the block, (d) the normal force on the block from the sur-
face of the incline, and (e) the net force on the block?

77 Asaparticle moves along an x axis,a force in the positive direc-
tion of the axis acts on it. Figure 7-50 shows the magnitude F of the
force versus position x of the particle. The curve is given by F = a/x?,
with a = 9.0N-m”. Find the work done on the particle by the force
as the particle moves from x = 1.0 m to x = 3.0m by (a) estimating
the work from the graph and (b) integrating the force function.

78 ACD case slides along a floor in the positive direction of an
x axis while an applied force F, acts on the case. The force is di-

rected along the x axis and has the x component F,,, = 9x — 3x,
with x in meters and F,, in newtons. The case starts at rest at the
position x = 0, and it moves until it is again at rest. (a) Plot the
work F, does on the case as a function of x. (b) At what position is
the work maximum, and (c) what is that maximum value? (d) At
what position has the work decreased to zero? (e) At what position

is the case again at rest?

 

79 SSM A 20kg lunchbox is sent sliding over a frictionless
surface, in the positive direction of an x axis along the surface.
Beginning at time ¢ = 0, a steady wind pushes on the lunchbox in the
negative direction of the x axis. Figure 7-51 shows the position x of
the lunchbox as a function of time tas the wind pushes on the lunch-
box. From the graph, estimate the kinetic energy of the lunchbox at
(a) t= 1.0 and (b) f= 5.0. (c) How much work does the force
from the wind do on the lunchbox from t = 1.0s tof = 5.0s?

80 Numerical integration. A breadbox is made to move along an
x axis from x = 0.15 m to x = 1.20 m by a force with a magnitude
given by F = exp(—2x), with x in meters and F in newtons. (Here
exp is the exponential function.) How much work is done on the
breadbox by the force?

81 Inthe block-spring arrangement of Fig, 7-10, the block’s mass
is 4.00 kg and the spring constant is 500 N/m. The block is released
from position x, = 0.300 m. What are (a) the block’s speed at x = 0,
(b) the work done by the spring when the block reaches x = 0, (c)

when the power is maximum?

 

82 A 4.00 kg block is pulled up a frictionless inclined plane by a
50.0 N force that is parallel to the plane, starting from rest. The nor-
mal force on the block from the plane has magnitude 13.41 N. What
is the block’s speed when its displacement up the ramp is 3.00 m?

83 A spring with a spring constant of 18.0 N/cm has a cage at-
tached to its free end. (a) How much work does the spring force do
on the cage when the spring is stretched from its relaxed length by
7.60 mm? (b) How much additional work is done by the spring force
when the spring is stretched by an additional 7.60 mm?

object, that moves in time interval 2.10 s from an initial posi-
tion 7; = (2. 701 — 2.90} + 5.50k) m to a final position 7) =
