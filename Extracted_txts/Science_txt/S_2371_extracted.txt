CHAPTER 8 POTENTIAL ENERGY AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

Substituting Eq. 8-5 into Eq. 8-1, we find that the change in potential energy
due to the change in configuration is, in general notation,

AU = - I “F(8) dx. (8-6)

Gravitational Potential Energy

We first consider a particle with mass m moving vertically along a y axis (the
positive direction is upward). As the particle moves from point y; to point y,,
the gravitational force F, does work on it. To find the corresponding change in
the gravitational potential energy of the particle-Earth system, we use Eq. 8-6
with two changes: (1) We integrate along the y axis instead of the x axis, because
the gravitational force acts vertically. (2) We substitute —mg for the force symbol F,
because F, has the magnitude mg and is directed down the y axis. We then have

AU= -{ (mg) dy = me [ dy = mel:
y Yi Vi

which yields
AU = mg(y;— yi) = mg Ay. (8-7)
Only changes AU in gravitational potential energy (or any other type of
potential energy) are physically meaningful. However, to simplify a calculation or
a discussion, we sometimes would like to say that a certain gravitational potential
value U is associated with a certain particle—Earth system when the particle is at
a certain height y. To do so, we rewrite Eq. 8-7 as

U- U;=mgly - yi). (8-8)
Then we take U; to be the gravitational potential energy of the system when it is

in a reference configuration in which the particle is at a reference point y;.
Usually we take U; = 0 and y; = 0. Doing this changes Eq. 8-8 to

U(y) = mgy (gravitational potential energy). (8-9)

This equation tells us:

Oo The gravitational potential energy associated with a particle—Earth system
depends only on the vertical position y (or height) of the particle relative to the
reference position y = 0, not on the horizontal position.

Elastic Potential Energy

‘We next consider the block—spring system shown in Fig. 8-3, with the block
moving on the end of a spring of spring constant k. As the block moves from
point x; to point x,, the spring force F, = —kx does work on the block.To find the
corresponding change in the elastic potential energy of the block—spring system,

we substitute —kx for F(x) in Eq. 8-6. We then have
y y
AU= -| (ke) dr = & | vac= ia) | ;
x; “ %

or AU = $kx} — $kx?. (8-10)

To associate a potential energy value U with the block at position x, we
choose the reference configuration to be when the spring is at its relaxed length
and the block is at x; = 0. Then the elastic potential energy U; is 0, and Eq. 8-10
