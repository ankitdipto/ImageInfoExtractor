A particle is to move along anx axis from x = 0 to x; while a conser
vative force, directed along the x axis, acts on the particle. The figure
shows three situations in which the x component of that force varies
with x. The force has the same maximum magnitude F, in all three sit-
uations. Rank the situations according to the change in the associated
potential energy during the particle’s motion, most positive first. a @ (3) A

Sample Problem 8.02 Choosing reference level for gravitational potential energy, sloth

Here is an example with this lesson plan: Generally you can
choose any level to be the reference level, but once chosen,
be consistent. A 2.0 kg sloth hangs 5.0 m above the ground
(Fig. 8-6).

(a) What is the gravitational potential energy U of the
sloth—Earth system if we take the reference point y = 0 to be
(1) at the ground, (2) at a balcony floor that is 3.0 m above

Figure 8-6 Four choices of reference point y = 0. Each y axis is marked

in units of meters. The choice affects the value of the potential energy

U of the sloth—Earth system. However, it does not affect the change

AU/in potential energy of the system if the sloth moves by, say, falling.

the ground, (3) at the limb, and (4) 1.0 m above the limb?
Take the gravitational potential energy to be zero at y = 0.

KEY IDEA

 

Once we have chosen the reference point for y = 0, we can
calculate the gravitational potential energy U of the system
relative to that reference point with Eq.8-9.

Calculations: For choice (1) the sloth is at y = 5.0m, and

U=mgy = (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s?)(5.0 m)

= 98). (Answer)
For the other choices, the values of U are
(2) U=mgy =mg(2.0 m) = 39J,
(3) U=mey = mg(0) = 05,
(4) U=mgy = mg(—1.0m)
= —19.6J ~ —20J. (Answer)

(b) The sloth drops to the ground. For each choice of refer-
ence point, what is the change AU in the potential energy of
the sloth—Earth system due to the fall?

KEY IDEA

The change in potential energy does not depend on the
choice of the reference point for y = 0; instead, it depends
on the change in height Ay.

Calculation: For all four situations, we have the same Ay =
—5.0 m. Thus, for (1) to (4), Eq. 8-7 tells us that

AU = mg Ay = (2.0kg)(9.8 m/s*)(—5.0 m)

= —98J. (Answer)
