Figure 8-9 (a) A plot of U(x), the potential energy function of a system containing a particle confined to move along an x axis. There is no
friction, so mechanical energy is conserved. (b) A plot of the force F(x) acting on the particle, derived from the potential energy plot by
taking its slope at various points. (c)-(e) How to determine the kinetic energy. (f) The U(x) plot of (a) with three possible values of Ecc
shown. In WileyPLUS, this figure is available as an animation with voiceover.
