9°22 <r A 60 kg skier starts from rest at height H = 20 mabove
the end ofa ski-jump ramp (Fig. 8-37) and leaves the ramp at angle
9 = 28°. Neglect the effects of air resistance and assume the ramp
is frictionless. (a) What is the maximum height h of his jump above
the end of the ramp? (b) If he increased his weight by putting on a
backpack, would / then be greater, less, or the same?

23 iLw The string in Fig. 8-38
is L = 120.cm long, has a ball
attached to one end, and is
fixed at its other end. The dis-
tance d from the fixed end toa
fixed peg at point Pis 75.0 cm.
When the initially stationary
ball is released with the string
horizontal as shown, it will
swing along the dashed arc.
What is its speed when it
reaches (a) its lowest point
and (b) its highest point after
the string catches on the peg?

24 A block of mass m = 2.0 kg is dropped
from height h = 40cm onto a spring of spring
constant k = 1960 N/m (Fig. 8-39). Find the max-
imum distance the spring is compressed.

25 Att=0a 1.0kg ball is thrown from a tall
tower with ¥ = (18 m/s)i + (24 m/s)j. What is
AU of the ball—Earth system between t = 0 and
t = 6.0 (still free fall)?

26 Aconservative force F = (6.0x — 12)i N,
where x is in meters, acts on a particle moving
along an x axis. The potential energy U associated
with this force is assigned a value of 27 J at x = 0.
(a) Write an expression for U as a function of x,
with U in joules and x in meters. (b)
What is the maximum positive poten-
tial energy? At what (c) negative
value and (d) positive value of x is the
potential energy equal tozero?

“27 Tarzan, who weighs 688N,
swings from a cliff at the end of a vine
18 m long (Fig, 8-40). From the top of
the cliff to the bottom of the swing, he
descends by 3.2 m. The vine will break
if the force on it exceeds 950N.
(a) Does the vine break? (b) If no,
what is the greatest force on it during
the swing? If yes, at what angle with
the vertical does it break?

CHAPTER 8 POTENTIAL ENERGY AND CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

28 Figure 841a applies to the spring
in a cork gun (Fig. 8-416); it shows the
spring force as a function of the stretch or
compression of the spring. The spring is
compressed by 5.5 cm and used to propel
a 3.8 cork from the gun. (a) What is the
speed of the cork if it is released as the
spring passes through its relaxed posi-
tion? (b) Suppose, instead, that the cork
sticks to the spring and stretches it 1.5 cm
before separation occurs. What now is the
speed of the cork at the time of release?

29 ssM WWW In Fig. 8-42, a block
of mass m = 12 kg is released from rest
on a frictionless incline of angle @ = 30°. (d)

Below the block is a spring that can be ;
compressed 2,0em by a force of 270, ure 8-41 Problem 28.
The block momentarily stops when

it compresses the spring by 5.5 cm.
(a) How far does the block move
down the incline from its rest posi-
tion to this stopping point? (b) What

is the speed of the block just as it
touches the spring?

30 © A2.0kg breadbox ona fric-
tionless incline of angle @= 40° is
connected, by a cord that runs over a
pulley, to a light spring of spring con-
stant k=120N/m, as shown in
Fig. 8-43. The box is released from rest when the spring is
unstretched. Assume that the pulley is massless and frictionless. (a)
What is the speed of the box when it has moved 10 cm down the in-
cline? (b) How far down the incline from its point of release does
the box slide before momentarily stopping, and what are the (c)
magnitude and (d) direction (up or down the incline) of the box’s
acceleration at the instant the box momentarily stops?
