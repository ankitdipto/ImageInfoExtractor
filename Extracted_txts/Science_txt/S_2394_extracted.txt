°°32 In Fig. 8-45, a chain is held
on a frictionless table with one-
fourth of its length hanging over
the edge. If the chain has length
L = 28cm and mass m = 0.012 kg,
how much work is required to pull
the hanging part back onto the
table?

+33 © In Fig. 8-46, a spring with
k =170 Nim is at the top of a fric-
tionless incline of angle @ = 37.0°.
The lower end of the incline is dis-
tance D = 1.00m from the end of
the spring, which is at its relaxed
length. A 2.00 kg canister is pushed
against the spring until the spring is
compressed 0.200m and released e_

from rest. (a) What is the speed of Figure 8-46 Problem 33.
the canister at the instant the spring

returns to its relaxed length (which is when the canister loses contact
with the spring)? (b) What is the speed of the canister when it
reaches the lower end of the incline?

+34 ® A boy is initially seated
on the top of a hemispherical ice
mound of radius R = 13.8m. He
begins to slide down the ice, with a
negligible initial speed (Fig. 8-47).
Approximate the ice as being fric-
tionless. At what height does the
boy lose contact with the ice?

35 @ In Fig. 8-42, a block of mass m = 3.20 kg slides from rest
a distance d down a frictionless incline at angle @ = 30.0° where it
runs into a spring of spring constant 431 N/m. When the block mo-
mentarily stops, it has compressed the spring by 21.0 cm. What are
(a) distance d and (b) the distance between the point of the first
block-spring contact and the point where the block’s speed is
greatest?

+36 @ Two children are
playing a game in which
they try to hit a small box
on the floor with a marble
fired from a spring-loaded
gun that is mounted on a
table. The target box is hori-
zontal distance D = 2.20m
from the edge of the table;
see Fig. 8-48. Bobby compresses the spring 1.10 cm, but the center
of the marble falls 27.0 cm short of the center of the box. How far
should Rhoda compress the spring to score a direct hit? Assume
that neither the spring nor the ball encounters friction in the gun.

«37 A uniform cord of length 25cm and mass 15 g is initially
stuck to a ceiling. Later, it hangs vertically from the ceiling with only
one end still stuck. What is the change in the gravitational potential
energy of the cord with this change in orientation? (Hint: Consider a
differential slice of the cord and then use integral calculus.)

Module 8-3 Reading a Potential Energy Curve

38 Figure 8-49 shows a plot of potential energy U versus posi-
tion x of a 0.200 kg particle that can travel only along an x axis
under the influence of a conservative force. The graph has these

values: Uy = 9.00 J, Uc = 20.00 J,and Up = 24.00 J. The particle is
released at the point where U forms a “potential hill” of “height”
U; = 12.00 J, with kinetic energy 4.00 J. What is the speed of the
particle at (a) x 5 m and (b) x = 6.5 m? What is the position
of the turning point on (c) the right side and (d) the left side?

x axis. (Nonconservative forces
are not involved.) Three values
are U, = 15.0J, Us = 35.05,

released at x = 4.5m with an
initial speed of 7.0 m/s, headed
in the negative x direction.
(a) If the particle can reach x = 1.0 m, what is its speed there, and if
it cannot, what is its turning point? What are the (b) magnitude
and (c) direction of the force on the particle as it begins to move to
the left of x = 4.0 m? Suppose, instead, the particle is headed in the
positive x direction when it is released at x mat speed 7.0 mis.
(d) If the particle can reach x = 7.0 m, what is its speed there, and if
it cannot, what is its turning point? What are the (e) magnitude and
(f) direction of the force on the particle as it begins to move to the
right of x = 5.0m?

#40 The potential energy of a diatomic molecule (a two-atom
system like H, or O,) is given by

 

where r is the separation of the two atoms of the molecule and A
and B are positive constants. This potential energy is associated
with the force that binds the two atoms together. (a) Find the equilib-
rium separation —that is, the distance between the atoms at which the
force on each atom is zero. Is the force repulsive (the atoms are
pushed apart) or attractive (they are pulled together) if their separa-
tion is (b) smaller and (c) larger than the equilibrium separation?
41 A single conservative force F(x) acts on a 1.0 kg particle
that moves along an x axis. The potential energy U(x) associated
with F(x) is given by

U(x) = 4x4

where x is in meters. At x = 5.0 m the particle has a kinetic energy
of 2.0 J. (a) What is the mechanical energy of the system? (b) Make
