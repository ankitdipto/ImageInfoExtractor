42 Aworker pushed a 27 kg block 9.2 m along a level floor at con-
stant speed with a force directed 32° below the horizontal. If the coef-
ficient of kinetic friction between block and floor was 0.20, what were
(a) the work done by the worker's force and (b) the increase in ther-
mal energy of the block —floor system?

*43 A collie drags its bed box across a floor by applying a hori-
zontal force of 8.0 N. The kinetic frictional force acting on the box
has magnitude 5.0 N. As the box is dragged through 0.70 m along
the way, what are (a) the work done by the collie’s applied force
and (b) the increase in thermal energy of the bed and floor?

mass 4.00 kg across a floor where the coefficient of kinetic friction is
0.600. (a) How much work is done by that applied force on the
block—floor system when the block slides through a displacement of
3.00 m across the floor? (b) During that displacement, the thermal
energy of the block increases by 40.0 J. What is the increase in ther-
mal energy of the floor? (c) What is the increase in the kinetic energy
of the block?

rope is 7.68 N and directed 15.0° above the horizontal. What are (a)
the work done by the rope’s force, (b) the increase in thermal en-
ergy of the block—floor system, and (c) the coefficient of kinetic

Module 8-5 Conservation of Energy

°46 An outfielder throws a baseball with an initial speed of
81.8 mi/h. Just before an infielder catches the ball at the same
level, the ball’s speed is 110 ft/s. In foot-pounds, by how much is the
mechanical energy of the ball—Earth system reduced because of
air drag? (The weight of a baseball is 9.0 oz.)

°47_ A 75g Frisbee is thrown from a point 1.1m above the
ground with a speed of 12 m/s. When it has reached a height of
2.1 m, its speed is 10.5 m/s. What was the reduction in E,,,. of the
Frisbee—Earth system because of air drag?

°48 In Fg. 8-51, a block slides
down an incline. As it moves from
point A to point B, which are 5.0m
apart, force F acts on the block, with
magnitude 2.0N and directed down
the incline. The magnitude of the fric-
tional force acting on the block is
10N. If the kinetic energy of the
block increases by 35 J between A and B, how much work is done on
the block by the gravitational force as the block moves from A to B?

result of air drag the skier returns to the ground with a speed of 22
mis, landing 14m vertically below the end of the ramp. From the
launch to the return to the ground, by how much is the mechanical
energy of the skier—Earth system reduced because of air drag?

side that is 500 m long and 300 m high. The coefficient of kinetic
friction between the rock and the hill surface is 0.25. (a) If the grav-
itational potential energy U of the rock—Earth system is zero at
the bottom of the hill, what is the value of U just before the slide?

attached to one end of a horizontal spring with spring constant
k = 400 Nim; the other end of the spring is fixed in place. The
cookie has a kinetic energy of 20.0J as it passes through
the spring’s equilibrium position. As the cookie slides, a frictional
force of magnitude 10.0 N acts on it. (a) How far will the cookie
slide from the equilibrium position before coming momentarily to
rest? (b) What will be the kinetic energy of the cookie as it slides
back through the equilibrium position?
