78 At a certain factory, 300kg
crates are dropped vertically from
a packing machine onto a conveyor
belt moving at 1.20 mvs (Fig, 8-64).
(A motor maintains the belt’s con-
stant speed.) The coefficient of ki-
netic friction between the belt and
each crate is 0.400. After a short
time, slipping between the belt and
the crate ceases, and the crate then moves along with the belt. For
the period of time during which the crate is being brought to rest
relative to the belt, calculate, for a coordinate system at rest in
the factory, (a) the kinetic energy supplied to the crate, (b) the
magnitude of the kinetic frictional force acting on the crate, and
(c) the energy supplied by the motor. (d) Explain why answers
(a) and (c) differ.

79 SSM A 1500kg car begins sliding down a 5.0° inclined road
with a speed of 30 km/h. The engine is turned off, and the only
forces acting on the car are a net frictional force from the road and
the gravitational force. After the car has traveled 50 m along the
road, its speed is 40 km/h. (a) How much is the mechanical energy
of the car reduced because of the net frictional force? (b) What is
the magnitude of that net frictional force?

80 © In Fig. 8-65, a 1400 kg block of granite is pulled up an incline
at a constant speed of 1.34 m/s by a cable and winch. The indicated
distances are d; = 40m and d; = 30m. The coefficient of kinetic
friction between the block and the incline is 0.40. What is the
power due to the force applied to the block by the cable?

PROBLEMS 209

81 A particle can move along only an x axis, where conservative
forces act on it (Fig, 8-66 and the following table). The particle is
released at x = 5.00 m with a kinetic energy of K = 14.0J and a
potential energy of U = 0. If its motion is in the negative direction
of the x axis, what are its (a) K and (b) U at x = 2.00 m and its
(c) Kand (d) Uat x = 0? If its motion is in the positive direction of
the x axis, what are its (e) K and (f) Uat x = 11.0m, its (g) K and
(h) U at x = 12.0 m, and its (i) K and (j) Uat x = 13.0 m? (k) Plot
U(x) versus x for the range x = 0 tox = 13.0m.

82 For the arrangement of forces in Problem 81, a 2.00 kg parti-
cle is released at x = 5.00 m with an initial velocity of 3.45 m/s in
the negative direction of the x axis. (a) If the particle can reach
x = 0m, what is its speed there, and if it cannot, what is its turning
point? Suppose, instead, the particle is headed in the positive x di-
rection when it is released at x = 5.00 m at speed 3.45 mis. (b) If
the particle can reach x = 13.0 m, what is its speed there, and if it
cannot, what is its turning point?

 

83 ssm A 15kg block is accelerated at 2.0 m/s along a horizon-
tal frictionless surface, with the speed increasing from 10 m/s to
30 m/s. What are (a) the change in the block’s mechanical energy
and (b) the average rate at which energy is transferred to the
block? What is the instantaneous rate of that transfer when the
block’s speed is (c) 10 m/s and (d) 30 m/s?

84 A certain spring is found not to conform to Hooke’s law. The
force (in newtons) it exerts when stretched a distance x (in meters)
is found to have magnitude 52.8x + 38.4x? in the direction oppos-
ing the stretch. (a) Compute the work required to stretch the
spring from x = 0.500 m to x = 1.00 m. (b) With one end of the
spring fixed, a particle of mass 2.17 kg is attached to the other end
of the spring when it is stretched by an amount x = 1.00 m. If the
particle is then released from rest, what is its speed at the instant
the stretch in the spring is x = 0.500 m? (c) Is the force exerted by
the spring conservative or nonconservative? Explain.

ator. At what rate does the generator produce electrical energy?
