216 CHAPTER 9 CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM

of mass is still the same distance from each particle. The com is a property of the
physical particles, not the coordinate system we happen to use.
We can rewrite Eq. 9-2 as
MYX, + M4Xy
Xom = ——+ > 9-3
om = (93)
in which M is the total mass of the system. (Here, M = m, + 1m.)
Many Particles. We can extend this equation to a more general situation in
which n particles are strung out along the x axis. Then the total mass is M = m, +
my +++++ m,, and the location of the center of mass is

Three Dimensions. If the particles are distributed in three dimensions, the cen-
ter of mass must be identified by three coordinates. By extension of Eq. 9-4, they are

We can also define the center of mass with the language of vectors. First
recall that the position of a particle at coordinates x;, y;, and z; is given by a posi-
tion vector (it points from the origin to the particle):

F=xit yj + zk. (9-6)

Here the index identifies the particle, and i, is and k are unit vectors pointing,
respectively, in the positive direction of the x, y, and z axes. Similarly, the position
of the center of mass of a system of particles is given by a position vector:

Feom = Xeoat + Yeoml + Zeomk- (9-7)

If you are a fan of concise notation, the three scalar equations of Eq. 9-5 can now
be replaced by a single vector equation,

~ 1a.
oom = Hg L Mib (9-8)
i=1

where again M is the total mass of the system. You can check that this equation
is correct by substituting Eqs. 9-6 and 9-7 into it, and then separating out the x,
y, and z components. The scalar relations of Eq. 9-5 result.

Solid Bodies

An ordinary object, such as a baseball bat, contains so many particles (atoms)
that we can best treat it as a continuous distribution of matter. The “particles”
then become differential mass elements dm, the sums of Eq. 9-5 become inte-
grals, and the coordinates of the center of mass are defined as

com = arf ram Voom = Gr | vam Zoom = x! zdm, (9-9)

where M is now the mass of the object. The integrals effectively allow us to use Eq.
9-5 for a huge number of particles, an effort that otherwise would take many years.

Evaluating these integrals for most common objects (such as a television set or
a moose) would be difficult, so here we consider only uniform objects. Such objects
have uniform density, or mass per unit volume; that is, the density p (Greek letter
