Assume the plate's
mass is concentrated
as a particle at the
plate's center of mass.

Here too, assume the
mass is concentrated
as a particle at the
center of mass.

Figure 9-4 (a) Plate P is a metal plate of radius 2, with a circular hole of radius R. The center of mass of P is at point comp. (b) Disk S.
(c) Disk Shas been put back into place to form a composite plate C The center of mass coms of disk § and the center of mass come
