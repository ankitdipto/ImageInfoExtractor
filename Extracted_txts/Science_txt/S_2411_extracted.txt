stage (Fig. 9-6). These actions shift her center of mass upward through her body.
Although the shifting center of mass faithfully follows a parabolic path across the
stage, its movement relative to the body decreases the height that is attained by her
head and torso, relative to that ofa normal jump. The result is that the head and torso
follow a nearly horizontal path, giving an illusion that the danceris floating. ==

Proof of Equation 9-14

Now let us prove this important equation. From Eq. 9-8 we have, for a system of n
particles,
MP ogg, = MyFy + MgFy + may ++ + My, (9-16)

in which M is the system’s total mass and Fm, is the vector locating the position of
the system’s center of mass.
Differentiating Eq. 9-16 with respect to time gives

MV oom = MV, + mgV> + MWVz +--+ + MW. (9-17)

Here v; (= d7;/dt) is the velocity of the ith particle, and Voom (= dF eom/dt) is the
velocity of the center of mass.
Differentiating Eq. 9-17 with respect to time leads to

May = Mh, + Milly + ml, + + ye (9-18)

Here @; (= dVj/dt) is the acceleration of the ith particle, and Wom (= d Veom/dt) is
the acceleration of the center of mass. Although the center of mass is just a geo-
metrical point, it has a position, a velocity, and an acceleration, as if it were a particle.

From Newton’s second law, m;@j is equal to the resultant force F, that acts on
the ith particle. Thus, we can rewrite Eq. 9-18 as

Mion = F, + F,+F+--++F, (9-19)

Among the forces that contribute to the right side of Eq. 9-19 will be forces that
the particles of the system exert on each other (internal forces) and forces
exerted on the particles from outside the system (external forces). By Newton’s
third law, the internal forces form third-law force pairs and cancel out in the sum
that appears on the right side of Eq. 9-19. What remains is the vector sum of
all the external forces that act on the system. Equation 9-19 then reduces to
Eq. 9-14, the relation that we set out to prove.
