Manipulating Eq. 9-23 by substituting for 7 from Eq. 9-22 gives, for constant
mass m,

Fret = de dt (mv) =m =ma.
Thus, the relations F,,,, = dp/dt and F,, = m@ are equivalent expressions of
Newton’s second law of motion for a particle.

The Linear Momentum of a System of Particles

Let’s extend the definition of linear momentum to a system of particles. Consider
a system of n particles, each with its own mass, velocity, and linear momentum.
The particles may interact with each other, and external forces may act on them.
The system as a whole has a total linear momentum P, which is defined to be the
vector sum of the individual particles’ linear momenta. Thus,

P=Pi+Pot+Pyt--°+PBy
= MV, + mV, + mV, + +++ + m,V,. (9-24)

If we compare this equation with Eq. 9-17, we see that

P= MV com (linear momentum, system of particles), (9-25)

which is another way to define the linear momentum of a system of particles:

Oo The linear momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total
mass M of the system and the velocity of the center of mass.

ity can change but not the mass), we find

Comparing Eqs. 9-14 and 9-26 allows us to write Newton’s second law for a sys-
tem of particles in the equivalent form

where F,,. is the net external force acting on the system. This equation is the gen-
eralization of the single-particle equation Foe = dpldt to a system of many
particles. In words, the equation says that the net external force Fig ona system.
of particles changes the linear momentum P of the system. Conversely, the linear
momentum can be changed only by a net external force. If there is no net exter-
nal force, P cannot change. Again, this fact gives us an extremely powerful tool
for solving problems.
