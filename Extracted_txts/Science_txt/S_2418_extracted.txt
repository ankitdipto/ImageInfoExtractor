9-4 COLLISION AND IMPULSE 229

Sample Problem 9.04 Two-dimensional impulse, race car—wall collision

Race car-wall collision. Figure 9-11a is an overhead view of
the path taken by a race car driver as his car collides with the
racetrack wall. Just before the collision, he is traveling at
speed v; = 70 m/s along a straight line at 30° from the wall.
Just after the collision, he is traveling at speed vp = 50 m/s
along a straight line at 10° from the wall. His mass m is 80 kg.

(a) What is the impulse J on the driver due to the collision?

KEY IDEAS

 

‘We can treat the driver as a particle-like body and thus apply
the physics of this module. However, we cannot calculate J
directly from Eq. 9-30 because we do not know anything about
the force F'(s) on the driver during the collision. That is, we do
not have a function of F(t) or a plot for it and thus cannot
integrate to find J. However, we can find J from the change in
the driver's linear momentum f via Eq. 9-32 (J = Bi; — Bi).

Calculations: Figure 9-11b shows the driver’s momentum J;
before the collision (at angle 30° from the positive x direction)
and his momentum patter the collision (at angle —10°). From
Eqs. 9-32 and 9-22 (p = mV), we can write

T = By i= niv;— mv, = mv, V). (9-41)

‘We could evaluate the right side of this equation directly on
a vector-capable calculator because we know m is 80 kg, ¥;
is 50 m/s at —10°, and ¥; is 70 m/s at 30°. Instead, here we
evaluate Eq. 9-41 in component form.
x component: Along the x axis we have
Je = mp. Vic)
= (80 kg)[(50 m/s) cos(—10°) — (70 m/s) cos 30°]
= —910 kg-mis.
ycomponent: Along the y axis,
Jy = (vp = Vy)
(80 kg)[(50 m/s) sin(—10°) — (70 m/s) sin 30°]
= —3495 kg-m/s ~ —3500 kg -m/s.

Impulse: The impulse is then
J = (—910i — 3500}) kg-m/s,
which means the impulse magnitude is
J = Viz + P= 3616 kg-m/s ~ 3600 kg: m/s.
The angle of J is given by

J,’
which a calculator evaluates as 75.4°. Recall that the physi-
cally correct result of an inverse tangent might be the
displayed answer plus 180°. We can tell which is correct here
by drawing the components of ui (Fig. 9-11c). We find that @
is actually 75.4° + 180° = 255.4°, which we can write as

6= —105°. (Answer)

(b) The collision lasts for 14 ms. What is the magnitude of
the average force on the driver during the collision?

KEY IDEA

 

From Eq. 9-35 (J = Fayg At), the magnitude Fy, of the aver-
age force is the ratio of the impulse magnitude J to the dura-
tion Af of the collision.

Calculations: We have
_ J _ 3616kg-m/s
we Ar 0.014s
= 2.583 x 10°N ~ 2.6 x 10°N.

(Answer)

Using F = ma with m = 80 kg, you can show that the magni-
tude of the driver’s average acceleration during the collision
is about 3.22 x 10? m/s? = 329g, which is fatal.

Surviving: Mechanical engineers attempt to reduce the
chances of a fatality by designing and building racetrack
walls with more “give,” so that a collision lasts longer. For
example, if the collision here lasted 10 times longer and the
other data remained the same, the magnitudes of the aver-
age force and average acceleration would be 10 times less
and probably survivable.
