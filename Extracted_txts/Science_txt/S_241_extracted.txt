What Mendel Found

The seven characters Mendel studied in his experiments
possessed several variants that differed from one another in
ways that were easy to recognize and score (figure 13.9).
We will examine in detail Mendel’s crosses with flower
color. His experiments with other characters were similar,

and they produced similar results.

The F; Generation

When Mendel crossed two contrasting varieties of peas,
such as white-flowered and purple-flowered plants, the
hybrid offspring he obtained did not have flowers of in-
termediate color, as the theory of blending inheritance
would predict. Instead, in every case the flower color of
the offspring resembled one of their parents. It is custom-
ary to refer to these offspring as the first filial (filius is

the data he obtained from these crosses. Each pair of traits appeared in the F) generation in very close to a 3:1 ratio.
