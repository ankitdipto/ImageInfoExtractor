CHAPTER 9 CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM

Sample Problem 9.06 Two-dimensional explosion, momentum, coconut

Two-dimensional explosion: A firecracker placed inside a
coconut of mass M, initially at rest on a frictionless floor,
blows the coconut into three pieces that slide across the floor.
An overhead view is shown in Fig. 9-13a. Piece C, with mass
0.30M, has final speed vce = 5.0 m/s.

(a) What is the speed of piece B, with mass 0.20M?

KEY IDEA

 

First we need to see whether linear momentum is con-
served. We note that (1) the coconut and its pieces form a
closed system, (2) the explosion forces are internal to that
system, and (3) no net external force acts on the system.
Therefore, the linear momentum of the system is conserved.
(We need to be careful here: Although the momentum of
the system does not change, the momenta of the pieces cer-
tainly do.)

Calculations: To get started, we superimpose an xy coordinate
system as shown in Fig. 9-13, with the negative direction of the
X axis coinciding with the direction of ¥;4. The x axis is at 80°
with the direction of ¥;~and 50° with the direction of V;,.

Linear momentum is conserved separately along each
axis. Let’s use the y axis and write

Piy = Pp (9-48)

where subscript i refers to the initial value (before the ex-
plosion), and subscript y refers to the y component of P,
or P;.

The component P;, of the initial linear momentum is
zero, because the coconut is initially at rest. To get an ex-
pression for P;,, we find the y component of the final linear
momentum of each piece, using the y-component version of
Eq. 9-22 (py = mvy):

Pfay =
Prry = —9.20Mvy_, = —0.20M vr sin 50°,
Pycy = 0.30Mvycy = 0.30Mvjc sin 80°.

 

(Note that pray =0 because of our nice choice of axes.)
Equation 9-48 can now be written as

Piy = Pry = Pray + Peay + Prey:
Then, with vrc = 5.0 m/s, we have
0 = 0 — 0.20Mvyg sin 50° + (0.30M)(5.0 m/s) sin 80°,
from which we find
Vip = 9.64 m/s ~ 9.6 m/s.
(b) What is the speed of piece A?

(Answer)

Calculations: Linear momentum is also conserved along
the x axis because there is no net external force acting on
the coconut and pieces along that axis. Thus we have

Pix = Pho (9-49)

where P;, = 0 because the coconut is initially at rest. To
get Py, we find the x components of the final momenta,
using the fact that piece A must have a mass of 0.50M
(= M — 0.20M — 0.30M):

Ppa = —0.50MV a,

Pypx = 0.20MV jp. = 0.20M vyp cos 50°,

Pycx = 9.30Mv jc. = 0.30Mv 5c cos 80°.
Equation 9-49 for the conservation of momentum along the
X axis can now be written as

Pix = Pre = Ppa + Prax + Prox
Then, with vrc = 5.0 m/s and vj = 9.64 m/s, we have
0 = —0.50Mv 4 + 0.20M(9.64 m/s) cos 50°
+ 0.30M(5.0 m/s) cos 80°,

from which we find

Vpa = 3.0 mis. (Answer)

The explosive separation
can change the momentum
of the parts but not the
momentum of the system.
