Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension

One-Dimensional Inelastic Collision

Figure 9-14 shows two bodies just before and just after they have a one-
dimensional collision. The velocities before the collision (subscript i) and after
the collision (subscript f) are indicated. The two bodies form our system, which is
closed and isolated. We can write the law of conservation of linear momentum for
this two-body system as

total momentum P, __ (total momentum P;
before the collision} ~ \ after the collision /”

which we can symbolize as
Pui + Pai = Pir + Poy (conservation of linear momentum). (9-50)

Because the motion is one-dimensional, we can drop the overhead arrows for
vectors and use only components along the axis, indicating direction with a sign.
Thus, from p = mv, we can rewrite Eq. 9-50 as

MyVy; + MV; = MVyp + MV7p. (9-51)

If we know values for, say, the masses, the initial velocities, and one of the final ve-
locities, we can find the other final velocity with Eq. 9-51.

One-Dimensional Completely Inelastic Collision

Figure 9-15 shows two bodies before and after they have a completely inelastic
collision (meaning they stick together). The body with mass mp happens to be ini-
tially at rest (v; = 0). We can refer to that body as the target and to the incoming
body as the projectile. After the collision, the stuck-together bodies move with
velocity V. For this situation, we can rewrite Eq. 9-51 as

my; = (my + m)V (9-52)
=m -
or V= m+ my Vie (9-53)

If we know values for, say, the masses and the initial velocity v,; of the projectile,
we can find the final velocity V with Eq. 9-53. Note that V must be less than v4; be-
cause the mass ratio m,/(m, + nm) must be less than unity.

Velocity of the Center of Mass

In a closed, isolated system, the velocity Vom of the center of mass of the system
cannot be changed by a collision because, with the system isolated, there is no net
external force to change it. To get an expression for Vom, let us return to the
