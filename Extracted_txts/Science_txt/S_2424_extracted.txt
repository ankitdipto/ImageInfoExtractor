two-body system and one-dimensional collision of Fig. 9-14. From Eq. 9-25
(P = MV jm), We can relate V,_ to the total linear momentum P of that two-body
system by writing

P= MVeon = (my + M2)Veom (9-54)

The total linear momentum P is conserved during the collision; so it is given by
either side of Eq. 9-50. Let us use the left side to write

P= Dy t Pri. (9-55)

Substituting this expression for Pin Eq. 9-54 and solving for Vom give us

The right side of this equation is a constant, and V,,,, has that same constant value
before and after the collision.

For example, Fig. 9-16 shows, in a series of freeze-frames, the motion of the
center of mass for the completely inelastic collision of Fig. 9-15. Body 2 is the tar-
get, and its initial linear momentum in Eq. 9-56 is Py = mV; = 0. Body 1 is
the projectile, and its initial linear momentum in Eq. 9-56 is pi; = mV}; Note
that as the series of freeze-frames progresses to and then beyond the collision,
the center of mass moves at a constant velocity to the right. After the
collision, the common final speed V of the bodies is equal to Voom because then
the center of mass travels with the stuck-together bodies.

Body 1 and body 2 are in a completely inelastic one-dimensional collision. What is
their final momentum if their initial momenta are, respectively, (a) 10 kg -m/s and 0;
(b) 10 kg m/s and 4 kg -m/s; (c) 10 kg nv/s and —4 kg - m/s?
