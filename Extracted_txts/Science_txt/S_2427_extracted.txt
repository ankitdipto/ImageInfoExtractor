238 CHAPTER 9 CENTER OF MASS AND LINEAR MOMENTUM

To do so, we rewrite Eq. 9-63 as
my (Vii — Vip) = MaVoy (9-65)
and Eq. 9-64 as*
m(vii — VY + Va) = Mov3y. (9-66)

After dividing Eq. 9-66 by Eq. 9-65 and doing some more algebra, we obtain

an Vor m, +m, Vii ( )

Note that v2; is always positive (the initially stationary target body with mass mm)

always moves forward). From Eq. 9-67 we see that vj, may be of either sign (the

projectile body with mass m; moves forward if m, > mp but rebounds if m; < m).
Let us look at a few special situations.

1. Equal masses If m, = m, Eqs. 9-67 and 9-68 reduce to
vip =O and vo = Vi,

which we might call a pool player’s result. It predicts that after a head-on colli-
sion of bodies with equal masses, body 1 (initially moving) stops dead in its
tracks and body 2 (initially at rest) takes off with the initial speed of body 1. In
head-on collisions, bodies of equal mass simply exchange velocities. This is
true even if body 2 is not initially at rest.

2. A massive target In Fig. 9-18, a massive target means that m) > my. For
example, we might fire a golf ball at a stationary cannonball. Equations 9-67
and 9-68 then reduce to

2m
Vip ~ Vii and Vo¢ ~ ( m t re (9-69)
n

 

This tells us that body 1 (the golf ball) simply bounces back along its incom-
ing path, its speed essentially unchanged. Initially stationary body 2 (the
cannonball) moves forward at a low speed, because the quantity in paren-
theses in Eq. 9-69 is much less than unity. All this is what we should expect.

3. A massive projectile This is the opposite case; that is, 7; > mp. This time, we
fire a cannonball at a stationary golf ball. Equations 9-67 and 9-68 reduce to

Vip ~My and Ve = 24; (9-70)

Equation 9-70 tells us that body 1 (the cannonball) simply keeps on going,
scarcely slowed by the collision. Body 2 (the golf ball) charges ahead at twice
the speed of the cannonball. Why twice the speed? Recall the collision de-
scribed by Eq. 9-69, in which the velocity of the incident light body (the golf
ball) changed from +v to —v, a velocity change of 2v. The same change in ve-
locity (but now from zero to 2v) occurs in this example also.

Moving Target
Now that we have examined the elastic collision of a projectile and a stationary
target, let us examine the situation in which both bodies are moving before they
undergo an elastic collision.

For the situation of Fig. 9-19, the conservation of linear momentum is written as

MyVy; + MV = MVyy + MV 9, (9-71)

*In this step, we use the identity a — 5? = (a — b)(a + b). It reduces the amount of algebra needed to
solve the simultaneous equations Eqs. 9-65 and 9-66.
