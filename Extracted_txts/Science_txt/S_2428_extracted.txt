9-7 ELASTIC COLLISIONS IN ONE DIMENSION

and the conservation of kinetic energy is written as

SMV}, + gIMgV3; = yy}, + Vy. (9-72)
To solve these simultaneous equations for vj, and v,, we first rewrite Eq. 9-71 as
My (Vij — Vip) = — Mg V2; — Vo))s (9-73)

and Eq. 9-72 as
mi (Vii — ViVi + Vi) = —M2( V2; — Vo~)(Vai + V29)- (9-74)

After dividing Eq. 9-74 by Eq. 9-73 and doing some more algebra, we obtain

m — Mm 2m)
Vp = vat Vi (9-75)
m +m my, + My,
2m mM, — mM
and Vop = 4, + v7. (9-76)
m +m m+ mM

Note that the assignment of subscripts 1 and 2 to the bodies is arbitrary. If we ex-
change those subscripts in Fig. 9-19 and in Eqs. 9-75 and 9-76, we end up with the
same set of equations. Note also that if we set v2; = 0, body 2 becomes a stationary
target as in Fig. 9-18, and Eqs. 9-75 and 9-76 reduce to Eqs. 9-67 and 9-68, respectively.

What is the final linear momentum of the target in Fig. 9-18 if the initial linear momen-
tum of the projectile is 6 kg “m/s and the final linear momentum of the projectile is (a)
2.kg-m/s and (b) —2 kg-m/s? (c) What is the final kinetic energy of the target if the
initial and final kinetic energies of the projectile are, respectively,5 J and 2 J?

Sample Problem 9.08 Chain reaction of elastic collisions

In Fig. 9-20a, block 1 approaches a line of two stationary
blocks with a velocity of v;; = 10 m/s. It collides with block 2,
which then collides with block 3, which has mass m; = 6.0 kg.
After the second collision, block 2 is again stationary and
block 3 has velocity v3,= 5.0 m/s (Fig. 9-20). Assume that the
collisions are elastic. What are the masses of blocks 1 and 2?
What is the final velocity v, of block 1?

KEY IDEAS

 

Because we assume that the collisions are elastic, we are to
conserve mechanical energy (thus energy losses to sound,
heating, and oscillations of the blocks are negligible).
Because no external horizontal force acts on the blocks, we
are to conserve linear momentum along the x axis. For these

two reasons, we can apply Eqs. 9-67 and 9-68 to each of the
collisions.

Calculations: If we start with the first collision, we have too
many unknowns to make any progress: we do not know the
masses or the final velocities of the blocks. So, let’s start with
the second collision in which block 2 stops because of its col-
lision with block 3. Applying Eq. 9-67 to this collision, with
changes in notation, we have
m — mM,
2 my + my V2is

where v>; is the velocity of block 2 just before the collision
and vp, is the velocity just afterward. Substituting v., = 0
(block 2 stops) and then m, = 6.0 kg gives us

Mm, = m, = 6.00 kg. (Answer)

With similar notation changes, we can rewrite Eq. 9-68 for
the second collision as
2m,

where v3,is the final velocity of block 3. Substituting mz = m3
and the given v3-= 5.0 m/s, we find

Voi = V3¢= 5.0 m/s.
