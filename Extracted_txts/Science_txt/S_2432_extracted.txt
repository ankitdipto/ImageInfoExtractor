Sample Problem 9.09 Rocket engine, thrust, acceleration

In all previous examples in this chapter, the mass of a system
is constant (fixed as a certain number). Here is an example of
a system (a rocket) that is losing mass. A rocket whose initial
mass M,; is 850 kg consumes fuel at the rate R = 2.3 kg/s. The
speed v,., of the exhaust gases relative to the rocket engine is
2800 m/s. What thrust does the rocket engine provide?

KEY IDEA

Thrust T is equal to the product of the fuel consumption
rate R and the relative speed v,,, at which exhaust gases are
expelled, as given by Eq. 9-87.
Calculation: Here we find
T = Rvjq = (2.3 kg/s)(2800 m/s)
= 6440N ~ 6400N.
(b) What is the initial acceleration of the rocket?

(Answer)

KEY IDEA

‘We can relate the thrust T of a rocket to the magnitude a of
the resulting acceleration with T= Ma, where M is the

eas

rocket’s mass. However, M decreases and a increases as fuel
is consumed. Because we want the initial value of a here, we
must use the intial value Mj; of the mass.

Calculation: We find

T _ 6440N
a=——=

= SERN = 76 mis?.
M,  850kg :

(Answer)

To be launched from Earth’s surface, a rocket must have
an initial acceleration greater than g = 9.8 m/s”. That is, it
must be greater than the gravitational acceleration at the
surface. Put another way, the thrust T of the rocket engine
must exceed the initial gravitational force on the rocket,
which here has the magnitude Mjg, which gives us

(850 kg) (9.8 m/s) = 8330 N.

 

Because the acceleration or thrust requirement is not met
(here T = 6400 N), our rocket could not be launched from
Earth’s surface by itself; it would require another, more
powerful, rocket.

Center of Mass The center of mass of a system of 1 particles is
defined to be the point whose coordinates are given by

Newton’s Second Law for a System of Particles The
motion of the center of mass of any system of particles is governed
by Newton's second law for a system of particles, which is

Fae = Micon (9-14)
Here F,,.: is the net force of all the external forces acting on the sys-
tem, M is the total mass of the system, and @,,,, is the acceleration
of the system’s center of mass.
