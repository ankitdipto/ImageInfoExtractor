«4 In Fig. 9-37, three uniform thin rods,
each of length L = 22cm, form an in-
verted U. The vertical rods each have a
mass of 14g; the horizontal rod has a
mass of 42 g. What are (a) the x coordi-
nate and (b) the y coordinate of the sys-
tem’s center of mass?

e*e7 ILW In the ammonia (NH;) mole-
cule of Fig. 9-40, three hydrogen (H)
atoms form an equilateral triangle, with
the center of the triangle at distance d =
94010" m from each hydrogen
atom. The nitrogen (N) atom is at the
apex of a pyramid, with the three hydro-
gen atoms forming the base. The nitro-
gen-to-hydrogen atomic mass ratio is
13.9, and the nitrogen-to-hydrogen dis-
tance is L = 10.14 xX 107! m. What are
the (a) x and (b) y coordinates of the
molecule’s center of mass?

«8 © A uniform soda can of mass
0.140 kg is 12.0cm tall and filled with
0.354kg of soda (Fig. 9-41). Then small
holes are drilled in the top and bottom
(with negligible loss of metal) to drain
the soda. What is the height h of the
com of the can and contents (a) initially
and (b) after the can loses all the soda?
(c) What happens to hf as the soda
drains out? (d) If x is the height of the
remaining soda at any given instant,
find x when the com reaches its lowest

*9 ILw A stone is dropped at ¢ = 0. A second stone, with twice the
mass of the first, is dropped from the same point at
t= 100 ms. (a) How far below the release point is the center of
mass of the two stones at t= 300ms? (Neither stone has yet
reached the ground.) (b) How fast is the center of mass of the two-
stone system moving at that time?

10 © A 1000kg automobile is at rest at a traffic signal. At the in-
stant the light turns green, the automobile starts to move with a
constant acceleration of 4.0 m/s’. At the same instant a 2000 kg
truck, traveling at a constant speed of 8.0 m/s, overtakes and passes
the automobile. (a) How far is the com of the automobile—truck
system from the traffic light at t = 3.0 s? (b) What is the speed of
the com then?

“11 A big olive (m=0.50kg) lies at the origin of an xy
coordinate system, and a big Brazil nut (M = 1.5 kg) lies at the
point (1.0, 2.0) m. At t= 0, a force F, = (2.01 + 3.0}) N begins to
act on the olive, and a force F,= = (—3.0i — 2.0}) N begins to act on
the nut. In unit-vector notation, what is the displacement of the
center of mass of the olive—nut system at f = 4.0 s, with respect to
its position at t= 0?

*12 Two skaters, one with mass 65 kg and the other with mass
40 kg, stand on an ice rink holding a pole of length 10 m and neg-
ligible mass. Starting from the ends of the pole, the skaters pull
themselves along the pole until they meet. How far does the 40
kg skater move?

*°13. ssM A shell is shot with an initial velocity ¥) of 20 m/s, at
an angle of @ = 60° with the horizontal. At the top of the trajec-
tory, the shell explodes into two fragments of equal mass (Fig.
9-42). One fragment, whose speed immediately after the explo-
sion is zero, falls vertically. How far from the gun does the other
fragment land, assuming that the terrain is level and that air drag
is negligible?

the coordinate system at time f = 0. Particle 1 of mass m, = 5.00 g is
shot directly along the x axis on a frictionless floor, with constant
speed 10.0 m/s, Particle 2 of mass m = 3.00 gis shot with a velocity
of magnitude 20.0 m/s, at an upward angle such that it always stays
directly above particle 1. (a) What is the maximum height Hy.

tation, what are the (b) velocity and (c) acceleration of the com

when the com reaches Hyyax?
