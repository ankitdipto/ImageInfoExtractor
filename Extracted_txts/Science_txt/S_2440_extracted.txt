°°47 A vessel at rest at the origin of an xy coordinate system ex-
plodes into three pieces. Just after the explosion, one piece, of mass
m, moves with velocity (—30 m/s)i and a second piece, also of mass.
m, moves with velocity (—30 m/s). The third piece has mass 3m.
Just after the explosion, what are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of the velocity of the third piece?

+48 © Particle A and particle B are held together with a com-
pressed spring between them. When they are released, the spring
pushes them apart, and they then fly off in opposite directions, free of
the spring. The mass of A is 2.00 times the mass of B, and the energy
stored in the spring was 60 J. Assume that the spring has negligible
mass and that all its stored energy is transferred to the particles.
Once that transfer is complete, what are the kinetic energies of (a)
particle A and (b) particle B?

49 A bullet of mass 10 strikes a ballistic pendulum of mass
2.0 kg. The center of mass of the pendulum rises a vertical distance
of 12cm. Assuming that the bullet remains embedded in the pen-
dulum, calculate the bullet’s initial speed.

*50 A 5.20g bullet moving at 672 m/s strikes a 700g wooden
block at rest on a frictionless surface. The bullet emerges, traveling
in the same direction with its speed reduced to 428 m/s. (a) What is
the resulting speed of the block? (b) What is the speed of the
bullet—block center of mass?

+51 © In Fig. 9-58a, a 3.50 g bullet is fired horizontally at two
blocks at rest on a frictionless table. The bullet passes through block
1 (mass 1.20kg) and embeds itself in block 2 (mass 1.80 kg). The
blocks end up with speeds v; = 0.630 m/s and v, = 140 m/s (Fig.
9-58b). Neglecting the material removed from block 1 by the bullet,
find the speed of the bullet asit (a) leaves and (b) enters block 1.

moving directly upward at 1000 m/s
strikes and passes through the cen-
ter of mass of a 5.0 kg block initially
at rest. The bullet emerges from the
block moving directly upward at 400
m/s. To what maximum height does
the block then rise above its initial
position?

°°53 In Anchorage, collisions of a vehicle with a moose are so
common that they are referred to with the abbreviation MVC.
Suppose a 1000 kg car slides into a stationary 500 kg moose on a
very slippery road, with the moose being thrown through the wind-
shield (a common MVC result). (a) What percent of the original
kinetic energy is lost in the collision to other forms of energy? A
similar danger occurs in Saudi Arabia because of camel-vehicle

collisions (CVC). (b) What percent of the original kinetic energy is
lost if the car hits a 300 kg camel? (c) Generally, does the percent
loss increase or decrease if the animal mass decreases?

54 Acompletely inelastic collision occurs between two balls of
wet putty that move directly toward each other along a vertical
axis, Just before the collision, one ball, of mass 3.0 kg, is moving up-
ward at 20 m/s and the other ball, of mass 2.0 kg, is moving down-
ward at 12 m/s. How high do the combined two balls of putty rise
above the collision point? (Neglect air drag.)

55 iw A5.0 kg block with a speed of 3.0 m/s collides with a 10
kg block that has a speed of 2.0 m/s in the same direction. After the
collision, the 10 kg block travels in the original direction with a
speed of 2.5 m/s. (a) What is the velocity of the 5.0 kg block imme-
diately after the collision? (b) By how much does the total kinetic
energy of the system of two blocks change because of the colli-
sion? (c) Suppose, instead, that the 10 kg block ends up with a
speed of 4.0 m/s. What then is the change in the total kinetic en-
ergy? (d) Account for the result you obtained in (c).

“56 In the “before” part of Fig. 9-60, car A (mass 1100 kg) is
stopped at a traffic light when it is rear-ended by car B (mass
1400 kg). Both cars then slide with locked wheels until the fric-
tional force from the slick road (with a low pz, of 0.13) stops them,
at distances d4 = 8.2 mand dg = 6.1 m. What are the speeds of (a)
car A and (b) car B at the start of the sliding, just after the colli-
sion? (c) Assuming that linear momentum is conserved during
the collision, find the speed of car B just before the collision.
(d) Explain why this assumption may be invalid.

the barrel at the point of maximum compression of the spring.
Assume that the increase in thermal energy due to friction be-
tween the ball and the barrel is negligible. (a) What is the speed of
the spring gun after the ball stops in the barrel? (b) What fraction
of the initial kinetic energy of the ball is stored in the spring?

**58 In Fig. 9-62, block 2 (mass 1.0
kg) is at rest on a frictionless surface
and touching the end of an un-
stretched spring of spring constant
200 Nim. The other end of the spring
is fixed to a wall. Block 1 (mass 2.0 kg), traveling at speed v; = 4.0
m/s, collides with block 2, and the two blocks stick together. When the
blocks momentarily stop, by what distance is the spring compressed?
