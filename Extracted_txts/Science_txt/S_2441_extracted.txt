**°59 ILW In Fig. 9-63, block 1 (mass 2.0 kg) is moving rightward at
10 mvs and block 2 (mass 5.0 kg) is moving rightward at 3.0 m/s.
The surface is frictionless, and a spring with a spring constant of
1120 Nim is fixed to block 2. When the blocks collide, the compres-
sion of the spring is maximum at the instant the blocks have the
same velocity. Find the maximum compression.

*61 SSM A cart with mass 340g

moving on a frictionless linear air track at an initial speed of 1.2 m/s
undergoes an elastic collision with an initially stationary cart of un-
known mass. After the collision, the first cart continues in its origi-
nal direction at 0.66 m/s. (a) What is the mass of the second cart?
(b) What is its speed after impact? (c) What is the speed of the two-
cart center of mass?

same speed and collide elastically. After the collision, one of the
spheres, whose mass is 300 g, remains at rest. (a) What is the mass

of massif the initial speed of each sphere is 2.00 m/s?

°°63 Block 1 of mass m slides along a frictionless floor and into a
one-dimensional elastic collision with stationary block 2 of mass
My = 3m). Prior to the collision, the center of mass of the two-
block system had a speed of 3.00 m/s. Afterward, what are the
speeds of (a) the center of mass and (b) block 2?

is fastened to a cord that is 70.0 cm long

and fixed at the far end. The ball is then

released when the cord is horizontal

(Fig. 9-65). At the bottom of its path,

the ball strikes a 2.50 kg steel block ini-

tially at rest on a frictionless surface.

another body at rest and continues to move in the original
direction but with one-fourth of its original speed. (a) What is the

axis on a frictionless floor and then undergoes a one-dimensional
elastic collision with stationary block 2, with mass m = 0.40m).The
two blocks then slide into a region where the coefficient of kinetic

frictionless ramp from height h = 2.50m and then collides with
stationary block 2, which has mass m = 2.00m;.After the collision,
block 2 slides into a region where the coefficient of kinetic friction

What is the value of distance d if the collision is (a) elastic and (b)
completely inelastic?

69 © <a A small ball of
mass 7m is aligned above a larger ball
of mass M = 0.63 kg (with a slight
separation, as with the baseball and
basketball of Fig. 9-68), and the
two are dropped simultaneously
from a height of h=18m.
(Assume the radius of each ball is
negligible relative to h.) (a) If the
larger ball rebounds elastically
from the floor and then the small
ball rebounds elastically from the
larger ball, what value of m results
in the larger ball stopping when it
collides with the small ball? (b)
What height does the small ball
then reach (Fig. 9-68b)?

across a frictionless lab bench, to undergo a one-dimensional elas-
tic collision with stationary puck 2. Puck 2 then slides off the bench
and lands a distance d from the base of the bench. Puck 1 rebounds
from the collision and slides off the opposite edge of the bench,
landing a distance 2d from the base of the bench. What is the mass
of puck 2? (Hint: Be careful with signs.)
