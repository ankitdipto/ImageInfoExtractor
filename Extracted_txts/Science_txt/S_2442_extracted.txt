Module 9-8 Collisions in Two Dimensions

*°71 IW In Fig, 9-21, projectile particle 1 is an alpha particle and
target particle 2 is an oxygen nucleus. The alpha particle is scattered
at angle 6, = 64.0° and the oxygen nucleus recoils with speed 1.20 X
10° m/s and at angle @ = 51.0°. In atomic mass units, the mass of the
alpha particle is 4.00 u and the mass of the oxygen nucleus is 16.0.u.
Whatare the (a) final and (b) initial speeds of the alpha particle?

“72 Ball B, moving in the positive direction of an x axis at speed
v, collides with stationary ball A at the origin. A and B have differ-
ent masses. After the collision, B moves in the negative direction of
the y axis at speed v/2. (a) In what direction does A move?
(b) Show that the speed of A cannot be determined from the given
information.

 

*°73 After a completely inelastic collision, two objects of the same
mass and same initial speed move away together at half their initial
speed. Find the angle between the initial velocities of the objects.
74 Two 2.0kg bodies, A and B, collide. The velocities before the
collision are ¥., = (151 + 30}) m/sand¥, = (—10i + 5.0}) mvs. After
the collision, ¥', = (—5.0i + 20})m/s. What are (a) the final velocity
of B and (b) the change in the total kinetic energy (including sign)?

 

75 @ A projectile proton with a speed of 500 m/s collides elasti-
cally with a target proton initially at rest. The two protons then
move along perpendicular paths, with the projectile path at 60°
from the original direction. After the collision, what are the speeds
of (a) the target proton and (b) the projectile proton?

Module 9-9 Systems with Varying Mass: A Rocket

°76 A 6090 kg space probe moving nose-first toward Jupiter at
105 m/s relative to the Sun fires its rocket engine, ejecting 80.0 kg
of exhaust at a speed of 253 m/s relative to the space probe. What is
the final velocity of the probe?

°77 SSM In Fig. 9-70, two long barges are moving in the same
direction in still water, one with a speed of 10 km/h and the other
with a speed of 20 km/h. While they are passing each other, coal is
shoveled from the slower to the faster one at a rate of 1000 kg/min.
How much additional force must be provided by the driving en-
gines of (a) the faster barge and (b) the slower barge if neither is to
change speed? Assume that the shoveling is always perfectly side-
ways and that the frictional forces between the barges and the water
do not depend on the mass of the barges.

°78 Consider a rocket that is in deep space and at rest relative to
an inertial reference frame. The rocket’s engine is to be fired for a

certain interval. What must be the rocket’s mass ratio (ratio of ini-
tial to final mass) over that interval if the rocket’s original speed
relative to the inertial frame is to be equal to (a) the exhaust speed
(speed of the exhaust products relative to the rocket) and (b) 2.0
times the exhaust speed?

°79 ssm itw A rocket that is in deep space and initially at rest
relative to an inertial reference frame has a mass of 2.55 X 10° kg,
of which 1.81 X 10° kg is fuel. The rocket engine is then fired for
250 s while fuel is consumed at the rate of 480 kg/s. The speed of
the exhaust products relative to the rocket is 3.27 km/s. (a) What is
the rocket’s thrust? After the 250 s firing, what are (b) the mass
and (c) the speed of the rocket?

Additional Problems

80 An object is tracked by a radar station and determined to have
a position vector given by 7” = (3500 — 160f)i + 2700} + 300K, with
Y in meters and fin seconds. The radar station’s x axis points east,
its y axis north, and its z axis vertically up. If the object is a 250 kg
meteorological missile, what are (a) its linear momentum, (b) its
direction of motion, and (c) the net force on it?

81 The last stage of a rocket, which is traveling at a speed of
7600 m/s, consists of two parts that are clamped together: a rocket
case with a mass of 290.0 kg and a payload capsule with a mass of
150.0 kg. When the clamp is released, a compressed spring causes
the two parts to separate with a relative speed of 910.0 m/s. What
are the speeds of (a) the rocket case and (b) the payload after they
have separated? Assume that all velocities are along the same line.
Find the total kinetic energy of the two parts (c) before and (d) after
they separate. (e) Account for the difference.

82 <= Pancake collapse of a tall
building. In the section of a tall
building shown in Fig, 9-71a, the in-
frastructure of any given floor K aq
must support the weight W of all
higher floors. Normally the infra-
structure is constructed with a
safety factor s so that it can with- I

stand an even greater downward (a) ()
force of sW. If, however, the support .

collapse and allow the higher floors to free-fall together onto floor
K (Fig. 9-71b), the force in the collision can exceed sW and, after a
brief pause, cause K to collapse onto floor J, which collapses on
floor J, and so on until the ground is reached. Assume that the
floors are separated by d = 4.0 m and have the same mass. Also as-
sume that when the floors above K free-fall onto K, the collision
lasts 1.5 ms. Under these simplified conditions, what value must the
safety factor s exceed to prevent pancake collapse of the building?

83 “Relative” is an important
word. In Fig. 9-72, block L of mass
m, = 1.00 kg and block R of mass
mp = 0.500 kg are held in place with
a compressed spring between them.
When the blocks are released, the spring sends them sliding across
a frictionless floor. (The spring has negligible mass and falls to the
floor after the blocks leave it.) (a) If the spring gives block L a re-
lease speed of 1.20 m/s relative to the floor, how far does block R
travel in the next 0.800 s? (b) If, instead, the spring gives block La
release speed of 1.20 m/s relative to the velocity that the spring
gives block R, how far does block R travel in the next 0.800 s?
