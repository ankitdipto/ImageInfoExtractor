84 Figure 9-73 shows an overhead
view of two particles sliding at constant
velocity over a frictionless surface. The
particles have the same mass and the
same initial speed v = 4.00 m/s, and they
collide where their paths intersect. An
x axis is arranged to bisect the angle be-
tween their incoming paths, such that
@ = 40.0°. The region to the right of the
collision is divided into four lettered
sections by the x axis and four numbered dashed lines. In what re-
gion or along what line do the particles travel if the collision is (a)
completely inelastic, (b) elastic, and (c) inelastic? What are their fi-
nal speeds if the collision is (d) completely inelastic and (e) elastic?

87 A ball having a mass of 150 g strikes a wall with a speed of
5.2 mvs and rebounds with only 50% of its initial kinetic energy. (a)
What is the speed of the ball immediately after rebounding? (b)

the ball is in contact with the wall for 7.6 ms, what is the magnitude of
the average force on the ball from the wall during this time interval?

88 A spacecraft is separated into two parts by detonating the ex-
plosive bolts that hold them together. The masses of the parts are
1200 kg and 1800 kg; the magnitude of the impulse on each part
from the bolts is 300 N-s. With what relative speed do the two
parts separate because of the detonation?

89 ssm A 1400kg car moving at 5.3 m/s is initially traveling
north along the positive direction of a y axis. After completing a
90° right-hand turn in 4.6 s, the inattentive operator drives into a
tree, which stops the car in 350 ms. In unit-vector notation, what is
the impulse on the car (a) due to the turn and (b) due to the colli-
sion? What is the magnitude of the average force that acts on the
car (c) during the turn and (d) during the collision? (e) What is the
direction of the average force during the turn?

tem. The electron moves away from the origin with linear momen-
tum (—1.2 X 10-2 kg-m/s)I; the neutrino moves away from the

spring and rest on a frictionless surface. They are given velocities
toward each other such that the 1.0 kg block travels initially at

95 SsM In the arrangement of Fig. 9-21, billiard ball 1 moving at a
speed of 2.2 nv/s undergoes a glancing collision with identical bil-
liard ball 2 that is at rest. After the collision, ball 2 moves at speed
1.1 m/s, at an angle of @ = 60°. What are (a) the magnitude and (b)
the direction of the velocity of ball 1 after the collision? (c) Do the

96 A rocket is moving away from the solar system at a speed of
6.0 X 103 m/s. It fires its engine, which ejects exhaust with a speed
of 3.0 X 103 m/s relative to the rocket. The mass of the rocket at
this time is 4.0 X 10* kg, and its acceleration is 2.0 m/s”. (a) What is

each other and are aligned per-
pendicular to the path of ball 1.

the contact point of balls 1 and 2. After the collision, what are the
(a) speed and (b) direction of the velocity of ball 2, the (c) speed
and (d) direction of the velocity of ball 3, and the (e) speed and (f)
direction of the velocity of ball 1? (Hint: With friction absent, each
impulse is directed along the line connecting the centers of the col-
liding balls, normal to the colliding surfaces.)
