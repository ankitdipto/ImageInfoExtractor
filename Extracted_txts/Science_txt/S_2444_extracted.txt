(b) after 20 g of sugar is transferred from container 1 to container
2? After the transfer and after the containers are released, (c) in
what direction and (d) at what acceleration magnitude does the
center of mass move?

100 In a game of pool, the cue ball strikes another ball of the
same mass and initially at rest. After the collision, the cue ball
moves at 3.50 m/s along a line making an angle of 22.0° with the
cue ball’s original direction of motion, and the second ball has a
speed of 2.00 m/s. Find (a) the angle between the direction of mo-
tion of the second ball and the original direction of motion of the
cue ball and (b) the original speed of the cue ball. (c) Is kinetic en-
ergy (of the centers of mass, don’t consider the rotation) con-
served?

101 In Fig. 9-78, a 3.2 kg box of
running shoes slides on a horizontal
frictionless table and collides with a
2.0 kg box of ballet slippers initially
at rest on the edge of the table, at
height h = 0.40 m. The speed of the
3.2 kg box is 3.0 m/s just before the
collision. If the two boxes stick to-
gether because of packing tape on their
sides, what is their kinetic energy just before
they strike the floor?

102 In Fig. 9-79, an 80 kg man is on a lad-
der hanging from a balloon that has a total
mass of 320 kg (including the basket passen-
ger). The balloon is initially stationary rela-
tive to the ground. If the man on the ladder
begins to climb at 2.5 m/s relative to the lad-
der, (a) in what direction and (b) at what
speed does the balloon move? (c) If the man
then stops climbing, what is the speed of the
balloon?

103 In Fig, 9-80, block 1 of mass m; = 6.6 kg
is at rest on a long frictionless table that is up
against a wall. Block 2 of mass mp is placed
between block 1 and the wall and sent sliding
to the left, toward block 1, with constant
speed v;. Find the value of m for which both
blocks move with the same velocity after block 2 has collided once
with block 1 and once with the wall. Assume all collisions are elastic
(the collision with the wall does not change the speed of block 2).

104 The script for an action movie calls for a small race car (of
mass 1500 kg and length 3.0 m) to accelerate along a flattop boat
(of mass 4000 kg and length 14 m), from one end of the boat to the
other, where the car will then jump —pock Boat

boat will initially touch the dock, as in Fig. 9-81; the boat can slide
through the water without significant resistance; both the car and
the boat can be approximated as uniform in their mass distribu-
tion. Determine what the width of the gap will be just as the car is
about to make the jump.

105 ssm A3.0kg object moving at 8.0 m/s in the positive direc-
tion of an x axis has a one-dimensional elastic collision with an ob-
ject of mass M, initially at rest. After the collision the object of
mass M has a velocity of 6.0 m/s in the positive direction of the
axis. What is mass M?

106 A 2140kg railroad flatcar, which can move with negligible
friction, is motionless next to a platform. A 242 kg sumo wrestler
runs at 5.3 m/s along the platform (parallel to the track) and then
jumps onto the flatcar. What is the speed of the flatcar if he then
(a) stands on it, (b) runs at 5.3 m/s relative to it in his original direc-
tion, and (c) turns and runs at 5.3 m/s relative to the flatcar oppo-
site his original direction?

107 SSM A 6100kg rocket is set for vertical firing from the
ground, If the exhaust speed is 1200 m/s, how much gas must be
ejected each second if the thrust (a) is to equal the magnitude of
the gravitational force on the rocket and (b) is to give the rocket an
initial upward acceleration of 21 m/s*?

108 A 500.0 kg module is attached to a 400.0 kg shuttle craft,
which moves at 1000 m/s relative to the stationary main spaceship.
Then a small explosion sends the module backward with speed
100.0 m/s relative to the new speed of the shuttle craft. As meas-
ured by someone on the main spaceship, by what fraction did the
kinetic energy of the module and shuttle craft increase because of
the explosion?

109 ssM (a) How far is the center of mass of the Earth-Moon
system from the center of Earth? (Appendix C gives the masses of
Earth and the Moon and the distance between the two.) (b) What
percentage of Earth’s radius is that distance?

110 A 140g ball with speed 7.8 m/s strikes a wall perpendicu-
larly and rebounds in the opposite direction with the same speed.

pulse and (b) average force on the wall from the ball during the
elastic collision?

111 ssm A rocket sled with a mass of 2900 kg moves at 250 m/s
on a set of rails. At a certain point, a scoop on the sled dips into a
trough of water located between the tracks and scoops water into
an empty tank on the sled. By applying the principle of conserva-
tion of linear momentum, determine the speed of the sled after
920 kg of water has been scooped up. Ignore any retarding force on
the scoop.

112 SSM A pellet gun fires ten 2.0 g pellets per second with a
speed of 500 m/s. The pellets are stopped by a rigid wall. What are
(a) the magnitude of the momentum of each pellet, (b) the ki-
netic energy of each pellet, and (c) the magnitude of the average
force on the wall from the stream of pellets? (d) If each pellet is
in contact with the wall for 0.60 ms, what is the magnitude of the
average force on the wall from each pellet during contact? (e)
Why is this average force so different from the average force cal-
culated in (c)?

113 A railroad car moves under a grain elevator at a constant
speed of 3.20 m/s. Grain drops into the car at the rate of 540 kg/min.

at constant speed if friction is negligible?
