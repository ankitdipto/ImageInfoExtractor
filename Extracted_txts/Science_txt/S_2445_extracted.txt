116 Two particles P and Q are released from rest 1.0 m apart. P has
a mass of 0.10 kg, and Q a mass of 0.30 kg, P and Q attract each other
with a constant force of 1.0 x 10? N. No external forces act on the
system. (a) What is the speed of the center of mass of P and Q when
the separation is 0.50 m? (b) At what distance from P’s original posi-
tion do the particles collide?

117 A collision occurs between a 2.00 kg particle traveling with
velocity 7; = (—4.00 mis)i + (5.00 mis) and a 4.00 kg particle
traveling with velocity ¥> = (6.00 m/s)i +(—2.00 m/s)j. The colli-
sion connects the two particles. What then is their velocity in (a)
unit-vector notation and as a (b) magnitude and (c) angle?

118 In the two-sphere arrangement of Fig. 9-20, assume that
sphere 1 has a mass of 50 g and an initial height of 4; = 9.0 cm, and
that sphere 2 has a mass of 85 g. After sphere 1 is released and col-
lides elastically with sphere 2, what height is reached by (a) sphere
1 and (b) sphere 2? After the next (elastic) collision, what height is
reached by (c) sphere 1 and (d) sphere 2? (Hint: Do not use
rounded-off values.)

120 A body is traveling at 2.0 m/s along the positive direction of
an x axis; no net force acts on the body. An internal explosion sepa-

rates the body into two parts, each of 4.0 kg, and increases the total
kinetic energy by 16 J. The forward part continues to move in the
original direction of motion. What are the speeds of (a) the rear

121 An electron undergoes a one-dimensional elastic collision
with an initially stationary hydrogen atom. What percentage of the
electron’s initial kinetic energy is transferred to kinetic energy of
the hydrogen atom? (The mass of the hydrogen atom is 1840 times
the mass of the electron.)

122 A man (weighing 915 N) stands on a long railroad flatcar
(weighing 2415 N) as it rolls at 18.2 m/s in the positive direction of
an x axis, with negligible friction. Then the man runs along the flat-
car in the negative x direction at 4.00 m/s relative to the flatcar.
What is the resulting increase in the speed of the flatcar?

123 Anunmanned space probe (of mass m and speed v relative to.
the Sun) approaches the planet Jupiter (of mass M and speed V;rel-
ative to the Sun) as shown in Fig. 9-84. The spacecraft rounds the
planet and departs in the opposite direction. What is its speed (in
kilometers per second), relative to the Sun, after this slingshot en-
counter, which can be analyzed as a collision? Assume v = 10.5 km/s
and V, = 13.0 km/s (the orbital speed of Jupiter). The mass of Jupiter
is very much greater than the mass of the spacecraft (M > m).

124 A 0.550 kg ball falls directly down onto concrete, hitting it

125 An atomic nucleus at rest at the origin of an xy coordinate
system transforms into three particles. Particle 1, mass 16.7 x 10-77

127 During a lunar mission, it is necessary to increase the speed
of a spacecraft by 2.2 m/s when it is moving at 400 m/s relative to
the Moon. The speed of the exhaust products from the rocket en-
gine is 1000 m/s relative to the spacecraft. What fraction of the
initial mass of the spacecraft must be burned and ejected to accom-
plish the speed increase?
