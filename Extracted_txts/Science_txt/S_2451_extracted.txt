262 CHAPTER 10 ROTATION

Sample Problem 10.01

The disk in Fig. 10-Sa is rotating about its central axis like a
merry-go-round. The angular position 6(t) of a reference
line on the disk is given by

6 = —1.00 — 0.600 + 0.25077, x
1.00 — 0.600 + 0.2507? 10-9)

with tin seconds, @ in radians, and the zero angular position
as indicated in the figure. (If you like, you can translate all
this into Chapter 2 notation by momentarily dropping the
word “angular” from “angular position” and replacing the
symbol @ with the symbol x. What you then have is an equa-
tion that gives the position as a function of time, for the one-
dimensional motion of Chapter 2.)

(a) Graph the angular position of the disk versus time
from t = —3.0 s tot = 5.4. Sketch the disk and its angular
position reference line at t= —2.0s, 0s, and 4.0s, and
when the curve crosses the f axis.

KEY IDEA
The angular position of the disk is the angular position

(t) of its reference line, which is given by Eq. 10-9 as a function
of time ¢. So we graph Eq. 10-9; the result is shown in Fig. 10-Sb.

At t=-2, the disk
is at a positive
(counterclockwise)
angle. So, a positive
@ value is plotted.

Now, the disk is
at a zero angle.

Angular velocity derived from angular position

Calculations: To sketch the disk and its reference line at a
particular time, we need to determine @ for that time. To do
so, we substitute the time into Eq. 10-9. For t = —2.0 s, we get

@ = —1.00 — (0.600)(—2.0) + (0.250)(—2.0)?

360° -
1.2 rad = 1.2 rad Inrad 69°.
This means that at t = —2.0s the reference line on the disk
is rotated counterclockwise from the zero position by angle
1.2 rad = 69° (counterclockwise because @/is positive). Sketch
1 in Fig. 10-5b shows this position of the reference line.
Similarly, for t= 0, we find @= —1.00 rad = —57°,
which means that the reference line is rotated clockwise
from the zero angular position by 1.0 rad, or 57°, as shown
in sketch 3. For t=4.0s, we find @= 0.60 rad = 34°
(sketch 5). Drawing sketches for when the curve crosses
the ¢ axis is easy, because then @ = 0 and the reference line
is momentarily aligned with the zero angular position
(sketches 2 and 4).

 

(b) At what time fyi, does 6(f) reach the minimum
value shown in Fig. 10-5b? What is that minimum value?

 

This is a plot of the angle
of the disk versus time.
