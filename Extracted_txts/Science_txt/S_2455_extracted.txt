10-2 RotATION WITH CONSTANT ANGULAR ACCELERATION

Learning Objective

After reading this module, you should be able to...

10.14 For constant angular acceleration, apply the relation- angular velocity, angular acceleration, and elapsed time
ships between angular position, angular displacement, (Table 10-1).
Key Idea

@ Constant angular acceleration (a = constant) is an important special case of rotational motion. The appropriate kinematic

equations are

w= w+tat,
8 = ent + Sat,
oF = ai + 204 — A),

 

Rotation with Constant Angular Acceleration

In pure translation, motion with a constant linear acceleration (for example, that
of a falling body) is an important special case. In Table 2-1, we displayed a series
of equations that hold for such motion.

In pure rotation, the case of constant angular acceleration is also important,
and a parallel set of equations holds for this case also. We shall not derive them
here, but simply write them from the corresponding linear equations, substituting
equivalent angular quantities for the linear ones. This is done in Table 10-1, which
lists both sets of equations (Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15 to 2-18; 10-12 to 10-16).

Recall that Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15 are basic equations for constant linear
acceleration—the other equations in the Linear list can be derived from them.
Similarly, Eqs. 10-12 and 10-13 are the basic equations for constant angular
acceleration, and the other equations in the Angular list can be derived from
them. To solve a simple problem involving constant angular acceleration, you can
usually use an equation from the Angular list (if you have the list). Choose
an equation for which the only unknown variable will be the variable requested
in the problem. A better plan is to remember only Eqs. 10-12 and 10-13, and then
solve them as simultaneous equations whenever needed.

Iv] Checkpoint 2

In four situations, a rotating body has angular position 6() given by (a) @ = 31 — 4,
(b) 0= —5#3 + 4? + 6,(c) 6 = 2/? — 4/t, and (d) @ = Sf? — 3.To which situations do
the angular equations of Table 10-1 apply?
