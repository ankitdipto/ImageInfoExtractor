10-2 ROTATION WITH CONSTANT ANGULAR ACCELERATION

267

Sample Problem 10.03 Constant angular acceleration, grindstone

A grindstone (Fig. 10-8) rotates at constant angular acceler-
ation a = 0.35 rad/s’. At time ¢ = 0, it has an angular velocity
of w) = —4.6 rad/s and a reference line on it is horizontal, at
the angular position @ = 0.

(a) At what time after t= is the reference line at the
angular position @ = 5.0 rev?

KEY IDEA

 

The angular acceleration is constant, so we can use the rota-
tion equations of Table 10-1. We choose Eq. 10-13,
0 — 6 = wot + fat,

because the only unknown variable it contains is the desired
time t.

Calculations: Substituting known values and setting @ = 0
and @ = 5.0 rev = 10zrrad give us

10arad = (—4.6 rad/s)t + (0.35 rad/s)i?.

We measure rotation by using
this reference line.

Clockwise = negative
Counterclockwise = positive

Figure 10-8 A grindstone. At t = 0 the reference line (which we
imagine to be marked on the stone) is horizontal.

(We converted 5.0 rev to 107 rad to keep the units consis-
tent.) Solving this quadratic equation for ¢, we find

t= 32s. (Answer)

Now notice something a bit strange. We first see the wheel
when it is rotating in the negative direction and through the
6 = 0 orientation. Yet, we just found out that 32 s later it is at
the positive orientation of @=5.0 rev. What happened in
that time interval so that it could be at a positive orientation?

(b) Describe the grindstone’s rotation between t = 0 and
t=32s.

Description: The wheel is initially rotating in the negative
(clockwise) direction with angular velocity w = —4.6 rad/s,
but its angular acceleration a is positive. This initial opposi-
tion of the signs of angular velocity and angular accelera-
tion means that the wheel slows in its rotation in the nega-
tive direction, stops, and then reverses to rotate in the
positive direction. After the reference line comes back
through its initial orientation of @= 0, the wheel turns an
additional 5.0 rev by time t = 32s.

(c) At what time ¢ does the grindstone momentarily stop?

Calculation: We again go to the table of equations for con-
stant angular acceleration, and again we need an equation
that contains only the desired unknown variable t. However,
now the equation must also contain the variable w,so that we
can set it to 0 and then solve for the corresponding time t. We
choose Eq. 10-12, which yields

o-m _ 0-(-46 rad/s) _
a — 0.35 rad/s*

   

13s. (Answer)

Sample Problem 10.04 Constant angular acceleration, riding a Rotor

While you are operating a Rotor (a large, vertical, rotating
cylinder found in amusement parks), you spot a passenger in
acute distress and decrease the angular velocity of the cylin-
der from 3.40 rad/s to 2.00 rad/s in 20.0 rev, at constant angu-
lar acceleration. (The passenger is obviously more of a “trans-
lation person” than a “rotation person.”) =

(a) What is the constant angular acceleration during this
decrease in angular speed?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the cylinder’s angular acceleration is constant, we
can relate it to the angular velocity and angular displacement
via the basic equations for constant angular acceleration
(Eqs. 10-12 and 10-13).

Calculations: Let's first do a quick check to see if we can solve
the basic equations. The initial angular velocity is wp) = 3.40

rad/s, the angular displacement is @— @ = 20.0 rev, and the
angular velocity at the end of that displacement is w = 2.00
rad/s. In addition to the angular acceleration a that we want,
both basic equations also contain time t, which we do not
necessarily want.

To eliminate the unknown f, we use Eg. 10-12 to write

p= 24
@

which we then substitute into Eq. 10-13 to write

0-&= a(2—*) mn jo(2=*Y.
a a
Solving for a, substituting known data, and converting
20 rev to 125.7 rad, we find
w — « _ (2.00 rad/s)? — (3.40 rad/s)?
— 2(8= 6) 2(125.7 rad)

= —0.0301 rad/s*. (Answer)
