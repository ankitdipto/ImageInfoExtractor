Although this is fast (111 km/h or 68.7 mi/h), such speeds are
common in amusement parks and not alarming because (as
mentioned in Chapter 2) your body reacts to accelerations but
not to velocities. (It is an accelerometer, not a speedometer.)
From Eq. 10-26 we see that the linear speed is increasing as the
square of the time (but this increase will cut off at t= 2.30s).
Next, let’s tackle the angular acceleration by taking the
time derivative of Eq. 10-25:

= 6(6.39 x 10°? rad/s*)(2.20 s) = 0.843 rad/s”. (Answer)
The tangential acceleration then follows from Eq. 10-22:

d
ie (3c?) = 6ct

4, = ar = 6ctr (10-27)
= 6(6.39 X 102 rad/s?)(2.20 s)(33.1 m)
= 27.91 mis? ~ 27.9 mis’, (Answer)

or 2.8g (which is reasonable and a bit exciting). Equation
10-27 tells us that the tangential acceleration is increasing
with time (but it will cut off at t = 2.30 s). From Eq. 10-23,
we write the radial acceleration as

a, = wr.
Substituting from Eq. 10-25 leads us to

a, = (3cP)?r = 9¢t'r (10-28)
= 9(6.39 x 10-2 rad/s#)2(2.20 s)4(33.1 m)
= 28.49 mis? ~ 28.5 m/s*, (Answer)

or 2.9g (which is also reasonable and a bit exciting).

The radial and tangential accelerations are perpendicu-
lar to each other and form the components of the rider’s
acceleration @ (Fig. 10-10b). The magnitude of @ is given by

a=Va? + a? (10-29)
= V(2849 mis? + (27.91 mis?
= 39.9 mis’, (Answer)

or 4.1g (which is really exciting!). All these values are
acceptable.
To find the orientation of @, we can calculate the angle 0
shown in Fig. 10-10b:

However, instead of substituting our numerical results, let’s
use the algebraic results from Eqs. 10-27 and 10-28:

Get 2
@= tan” ( | = tan-(25) (10-30)

The big advantage of solving for the angle algebraically is that
we can then see that the angle (1) does not depend on the
ring’s radius and (2) decreases as t goes from 0 to 2.20 s. That
is, the acceleration vector d swings toward being radially in-
ward because the radial acceleration (which depends on f)
quickly dominates over the tangential acceleration (which
depends on only ¢). At our given time ¢ = 2.20 s, we have

D

@= tan? = 44.4. (Answer)

The rapidly rotating blade of a table saw certainly has kinetic energy due to that
rotation. How can we express the energy? We cannot apply the familiar formula
K = }mv’ to the saw as a whole because that would give us the kinetic energy

only of the saw’s center of mass, which is zero.
