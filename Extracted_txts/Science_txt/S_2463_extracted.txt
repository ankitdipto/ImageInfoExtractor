We need to relate the rotational inertia
around the axis at P to that around the
axis at the com.

with its center of mass at O.The parallel-
axis theorem (Eq. 10-36) relates the
rotational inertia of the body about an axis

through the center of mass (remember these two axes must be parallel). Then the
rotational inertia / about the given axis is
T= Tem + Mh? (10-36)

Think of the distance h as being the distance we have shifted the rotation axis
from being through the com.This equation is known as the parallel-axis theorem.
‘We shall now prove it.

(parallel-axis theorem).

Proof of the Parallel-Axis Theorem

Let O be the center of mass of the arbitrarily shaped body shown in cross section
in Fig. 10-12. Place the origin of the coordinates at O. Consider an axis through O
perpendicular to the plane of the figure, and another axis through point P paral-
lel to the first axis. Let the x and y coordinates of P be a and b.

Let dm be a mass element with the general coordinates x and y. The rota-
tional inertia of the body about the axis through P is then, from Eq. 10-35,

T= fran = fie-a+0- by] dm,
which we can rearrange as
I= foes y?) dm — 20 xam - 2 [ yam + iG +b?)dm. (10-37)

From the definition of the center of mass (Eq. 9-9), the middle two integrals of
Eq. 10-37 give the coordinates of the center of mass (multiplied by a constant)
