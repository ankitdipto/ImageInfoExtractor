10.29 Calculate the work done by a torque acting on a rotat-

ing body by integrating the torque with respect to the an-
gle of rotation.
10.30 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to relate the

work done by a torque to the resulting change in the rota-

tional kinetic energy of the body.

10.31 Calculate the work done by a constant torque by relat-
ing the work to the angle through which the body rotates.

10.32 Calculate the power of a torque by finding the rate at
which work is done.

10.33 Calculate the power of a torque at any given instant by
relating it to the torque and the angular velocity at that instant.

 

Key Ideas

@ The equations used for calculating work and power in rota-

tional motion correspond to equations used for translational

motion and are
%
Wwe= I 7d0

dw

and P

—_ = Tw.

dt

 

@ When ris constant, the integral reduces to
W= (0; — 6).

@ The form of the work—kinetic energy theorem used for
rotating bodies is

AK = K, — K, = }laf — $a? = W.

 

Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy

As we discussed in Chapter 7, when a force F causes a rigid body of mass m to ac-
celerate along a coordinate axis, the force does work W on the body. Thus, the
body’s kinetic energy (K = zmv?) can change. Suppose it is the only energy of the
body that changes. Then we relate the change AK in kinetic energy to the work W
with the work—kinetic energy theorem (Eq. 7-10), writing

AK = K;— K, = 4mv} — $mv}? = W  (work—kineticenergy theorem). (10-49)
For motion confined to an x axis, we can calculate the work with Eq. 7-32,
y
Wwe I Fdx (work, one-dimensional motion). (10-50)
%

This reduces to W= Fd when F is constant and the body’s displacement is d.
The rate at which the work is done is the power, which we can find with Eqs. 7-43

and 7-48,

Now let us consider a rotational situation that is similar. When a torque
accelerates a rigid body in rotation about a fixed axis, the torque does work W
on the body. Therefore, the body’s rotational kinetic energy (K = 31a?) can
change. Suppose that it is the only energy of the body that changes. Then we
can still relate the change AK in kinetic energy to the work W with the
work—kinetic energy theorem, except now the kinetic energy is a rotational

kinetic energy:

AK = K, — K, = Saf — 3Iu? = W  (work-kineticenergy theorem).

(10-52)

Here, J is the rotational inertia of the body about the fixed axis and @; and a, are
the angular speeds of the body before and after the work is done.
