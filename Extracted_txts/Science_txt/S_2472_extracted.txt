Also, we can calculate the work with a rotational equivalent of Eq. 10-50,

w= I © 7d (work, rotation about fixed axis), (10-53)
a

where 7 is the torque doing the work W, and 4, and 6 are the body’s angular
positions before and after the work is done, respectively. When + is constant,

Eg. 10-53 reduces to

W = (6-6)

(work, constant torque). (10-54)

The rate at which the work is done is the power, which we can find with the rota-

tional equivalent of Eq. 10-51,

(power, rotation about fixed axis). (10-55)

Table 10-3 summarizes the equations that apply to the rotation of a rigid body
about a fixed axis and the corresponding equations for translational motion.

Proof of Eqs. 10-52 through 10-55

Let us again consider the situation of Fig, 10-17, in which force F rotates a rigid
body consisting of a single particle of mass m fastened to the end of a massless
rod. During the rotation, force F does work on the body. Let us assume that the
only energy of the body that is changed by F is the kinetic energy. Then we can
apply the work —kinetic energy theorem of Eq. 10-49:

AK = K;- K,=W. (10-56)

Using K = }mv?and Eq. 10-18 (v = wr), we can rewrite Eq. 10-56 as

AK = 5mr2of — xmr2ap = Wz (10-57)

From Eq. 10-33, the rotational inertia for this one-particle body is J = mr?.

Substituting this into Eq. 10-57 yields

K = slo — 31a} = W,

which is Eq. 10-52. We derived it for a rigid body with one particle, but it holds for

any rigid body rotated about a fixed axis.

We next relate the work W done on the body in Fig. 10-17 to the torque r
on the body due to force F. When the particle moves a distance ds along its
