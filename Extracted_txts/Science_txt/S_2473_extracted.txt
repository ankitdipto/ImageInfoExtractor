CHAPTER 10 ROTATION

circular path, only the tangential component F, of the force accelerates the parti-
cle along the path. Therefore, only F, does work on the particle. We write that
work dW as F, ds. However, we can replace ds with r d6, where d@ is the angle

through which the particle moves. Thus we have
dW = F,r dé. (10-58)

From Eq. 10-40, we see that the product F,r is equal to the torque 7, so we can
rewrite Eq. 10-58 as
dW = rdé.

W= I 7d,

which is Eq. 10-53. It holds for any rigid body rotating about a fixed axis.
Equation 10-54 comes directly from Eq. 10-53.
We can find the power P for rotational motion from Eq. 10-59:
—4W _ 48

(10-59)

which is Eq. 10-55.

Sample Problem 10.11 Work, rotational kinetic energy, torque, disk

Let the disk in Fig. 10-19 start from rest at time t = 0 and
also let the tension in the massless cord be 6.0 N and the an-
gular acceleration of the disk be —24 rad/s”. What is its rota-
tional kinetic energy K at t= 2.5 s?

KEY IDEA

 

We can find K with Eq. 10-34 (K = Jw”). We already know
that J = 3MR?, but we do not yet know at t=2.5s.
However, because the angular acceleration a has the con-
stant value of —24 rad/s, we can apply the equations for
constant angular acceleration in Table 10-1.

Calculations: Because we want w and know aand «a (= 0),
we use Eq. 10-12:

@ = w+ at =0 + at = al.
Substituting w = atand J = MR? into Eq. 10-34, we find

K = 31? = 3(3MR?)(at)? = {M(Rat)?
= 4(2.5 kg)[(0.20 m)(—24 rad/s?)(2.5 s)?
= 905. (Answer)

KEY IDEA

 

‘We can also get this answer by finding the disk’s kinetic
energy from the work done on the disk.

Calculations: First, we relate the change in the kinetic
energy of the disk to the net work W done on the disk, using
the work—kinetic energy theorem of Eq. 10-52 (K;— K; = W).
With K substituted for K; and 0 for K;, we get

K=K,+W=0+ W=wW. (10-60)

Next we want to find the work W. We can relate W to
the torques acting on the disk with Eq. 10-53 or 10-54. The
only torque causing angular acceleration and doing work is
the torque due to force T on the disk from the cord, which is
equal to —TR. Because a is constant, this torque also must

be constant. Thus, we can use Eq. 10-54 to write
W = 7(6;— 6) = —TR(6,— @)- (10-61)

Because a is constant, we can use Eg. 10-13 to find
6 — 6;.With w; = 0,we have

0; — 6; = wit + Sat? = 0 + fat? = jat?

Now we substitute this into Eq. 10-61 and then substitute the
result into Eq. 10-60. Inserting the given values T = 6.0N
and a@ = —24 rad/s”, we have

K = W = -TR(6, — 6) = —TR(gat?) = —5TRat”
—4(6.0 N)(0.20 m)(—24 rad/s)(2.5 s)*
= 90J.
