Review & Summary

 

Angular Position To describe the rotation ofa rigid body about
a fixed axis, called the rotation axis, we assume a reference line is
fixed in the body, perpendicular to that axis and rotating with the
body. We measure the angular position 6 of this line relative to a fixed
direction. When @is measured in radians,

(10-1)

s
@=— (radian measure),
r

where s is the arc length of a circular path of radius rand angle 6.
Radian measure is related to angle measure in revolutions and de-
grees by

1 rev = 360° = 27rad. (10-2)
Angular Displacement A body that rotates about a rotation
axis, changing its angular position from @, to @;, undergoes an angu-

lar displacement
AO= 4, (10-4)

where A@is positive for counterclockwise rotation and negative for
clockwise rotation.

Angular Velocity and Speed Ifa body rotates through an
angular displacement A@in a time interval Af, its average angular
velocity «4. is

Ae

One = Fy (10-5)
The (instantaneous) angular velocity « of the body is

oe (10-6)

Both @,,, and w are vectors, with directions given by the right-hand
rule of Fig. 10-6. They are positive for counterclockwise rotation
and negative for clockwise rotation. The magnitude of the body’s
angular velocity is the angular speed.

Angular Acceleration If the angular velocity of a body
changes from @; to @ in a time interval At = h — f, the average
angular acceleration a,,, of the body is

= mm _ ho -
Soe = ar (10-7)
The (instantaneous) angular acceleration a of the body is
dw

Both a,, and a are vectors.

 

The Kinematic Equations for Constant Angular Accel-
eration Constant angular acceleration (a = constant) is an im-
portant special case of rotational motion. The appropriate kine-
matic equations, given in Table 10-1, are

@= w+ at, (10-12)
0— & = wf t+ far’, (10-13)
w& = a + 2a(0— A), (10-14)
0 — % = F(a + wt, (10-15)
0 — % = wt — fat”. (10-16)

moves in a circle with radius r. If the body rotates through an angle 6,
the point moves along an are with lengths given by

The linear velocity V of the point is tangent to the circle; the
point’s linear speed vis given by

The linear acceleration @ of the point has both tangential and

radial components. The tangential component is

where a is the magnitude of the angular acceleration (in radians
per second-squared) of the body. The radial component of @ is,

Rotational Kinetic Energy and Rotational Inertia The ki-
netic energy K of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by

K = jlo? (radian measure), (10-34)
in which /is the rotational inertia of the body, defined as
1=> my? (10-33)
for a system of discrete particles and defined as
I= | rdm (10-35)

for a body with continuously distributed mass. The r and r; in these
expressions represent the perpendicular distance from the axis of
rotation to each mass element in the body, and the integration is car-
ried out over the entire body so as to include every mass element.

The Parallel-Axis Theorem The parallel-axis theorem relates
the rotational inertia J of a body about any axis to that of the same
body about a parallel axis through the center of mass:

T= Toon, + MIP. (10-36)

Here h is the perpendicular distance between the two axes, and
Tom is the rotational inertia of the body about the axis through the
com. We can describe h as being the distance the actual rotation
axis has been shifted from the rotation axis through the com.

Torque Torque is a tuming or twisting action on a body about a ro-
tation axis due to a force F .If F is exerted at a point given by the po-
sition vector F relative to the axis, then the magnitude of the torque is

r=rF=r,F =1Fsind, (10-40, 10-41, 10-39)
where F, is the component of F perpendicular to 7 and ¢ is the an-
gle between 7 and F. The quantity r, is the perpendicular distance
between the rotation axis and an extended line running through
the F vector. This line is called the line of action of F, and r, is
called the moment arm of F.. Similarly, r is the moment arm of F.
