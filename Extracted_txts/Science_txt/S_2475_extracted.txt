286 CHAPTER 10 ROTATION

The SI unit of torque is the newton-meter (N-m). A torque +
is positive if it tends to rotate a body at rest counterclockwise and
negative if it tends to rotate the body clockwise.

Newton’s Second Law in Angular Form The rotational
analog of Newton’s second law is

Toot = Le, (10-45)
where 7,,, is the net torque acting on a particle or rigid body, /is the ro-
tational inertia of the particle or body about the rotation axis, and a is
the resulting angular acceleration about that axis.

Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy The equations used
for calculating work and power in rotational motion correspond to

3 A force is applied to the rim of a disk that can rotate like
a merry-go-round, so as to change its angular velocity. Its initial
and final angular velocities, respectively, for four situations are:
(a) —2 rad/s, 5 rad/s; (b) 2 rad/s, 5 rad/s; (c) —2 rad/s, —5 rad/s; and
(d) 2 rad/s, —5 rad/s. Rank the situations according to the work
done by the torque due to the force, greatest first.

disk of Fig. 10-22a. Is the angular velocity of the disk positive, nega-
tive, or zero at (a) f= 1s, (b) f= 2s, and (c) ¢ = 3s? (d) Is the an-
gular acceleration positive or negative?

5 In Fig. 10-23, two forces F, and F act on a disk that turns about
its center like a merry-go-round. The forces maintain the indicated

 

gular speed constant, should we in-
crease, decrease, or maintain the mag-
nitude of F,? Do forces (b) F; and (c)
F, tend to rotate the disk clockwise or -
counterclockwise?

bar, but it is stationary. If the angle between the bar and F; is now
decreased from 90° and the bar is still not to turn, should F, be
made larger, made smaller, or left the same?
