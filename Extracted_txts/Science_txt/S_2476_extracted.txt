10 Figure 10-27 shows three flat disks (of the same radius) that
can rotate about their centers like merry-go-rounds. Each disk con-
sists of the same two materials, one denser than the other (density is
mass per unit volume). In disks 1 and 3, the denser material forms
the outer half of the disk area. In disk 2, it forms the inner half of the
disk area. Forces with identical magnitudes are applied tangentially
to the disk, either at the outer edge or at the interface of the two ma-
terials, as shown. Rank the disks according to (a) the torque about
the disk center, (b) the rotational inertia about the disk center, and
(c) the angular acceleration of the disk, greatest first.

end at a. In Fig. 10-28b, the stick is reversed and pivoted at the steel

the same as that of Fig. 10-28b?

*1 A good baseball pitcher can throw a baseball toward home
plate at 85 mi/h with a spin of 1800 rev/min. How many revolutions
does the baseball make on its way to home plate? For simplicity,
assume that the 60 ft path is a straight line.

minute hand, and (c) the hour hand of a smoothly running analog
watch? Answer in radians per second.

°°3 <= When a slice of buttered toast is accidentally pushed
over the edge of a counter, it rotates as it falls. If the distance to the
floor is 76 cm and for rotation less than 1 rev, what are the (a)
smallest and (b) largest angular speeds that cause the toast to hit
and then topple to be butter-side down?

“7 The wheel in Fig. 10-30 has eight equally spaced spokes and
a radius of 30 cm. It is mounted on a fixed axle and is spinning at 2.5
rev/s. You want to shoot a 20-cm-long arrow parallel to this axle and

through the wheel without hitting any
of the spokes. Assume that the arrow
and the spokes are very thin. (a) What
minimum speed must the arrow have?

axle and rim of the wheel you aim? If
so, what is the best location?
