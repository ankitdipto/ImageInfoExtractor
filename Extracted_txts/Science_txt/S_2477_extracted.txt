e18 A pulsar isa rapidly rotating neutron star that emits a radio
beam the way a lighthouse emits a light beam. We receive a radio
pulse for each rotation of the star. The period T of rotation is found
by measuring the time between pulses. The pulsar in the Crab neb-
ula has a period of rotation of T = 0.033 s that is increasing at the
rate of 1.26 X 10-5 s/y. (a) What is the pulsar’s angular acceleration

°24 A vinyl record is played by rotating the record so that an ap-
proximately circular groove in the vinyl slides under a stylus.
Bumps in the groove run into the stylus, causing it to oscillate. The
equipment converts those oscillations to electrical signals and then
to sound. Suppose that a record turns at the rate of 33; rev/min, the
groove being played is at a radius of 10.0 cm, and the bumps in the
groove are uniformly separated by 1.75 mm. At what rate (hits per
second) do the bumps hit the stylus?

r, =10cm is coupled by belt B to
wheel C of radius r¢ = 25 cm. The an-
gular speed of wheel A is increased
from rest at a constant rate of
1.6 rad/s’. Find the time needed for
wheel C to reach an angular speed of
100 rev/min, assuming the belt does
not slip. (Hint: If the belt does not slip, the linear speeds at the two
rims must be equal.)
