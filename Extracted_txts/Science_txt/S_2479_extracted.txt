°°43 SSM WWW The uniform solid Rotation
block in Fig. 10-38 has mass 0.172kg
and edge lengths a =3.5cm, b= 84

cm, and c = 1.4 cm. Calculate its rota-

tional inertia about an axis through

one corner and perpendicular to the

large faces.

“44 Four identical particles of
mass 0.50 kg each are placed at the
vertices of a 2.0m X 2.0m square
and held there by four massless rods, which form the sides of the
square. What is the rotational inertia of this rigid body about an
axis that (a) passes through the midpoints of opposite sides and
lies in the plane of the square, (b) passes through the midpoint of
one of the sides and is perpendicular to the plane of the square,
and (c) lies in the plane of the square and passes through two di-
agonally opposite particles?

°45 SSM ILW The body in
Fig. 10-39 is pivoted at O, and
two forces act on it as shown. If
7, =130m, m1 =2.15m, A=
4.20N, Fy =4.90N, 6; =75.0°,
and @, = 60.0°, what is the net
torque about the pivot?

°46 The body in Fig, 10-40 is
pivoted at O. Three forces act
on it: Fy = 10 Nat point A, 8.0
m from O; Fz = 16N at B, 4.0
m from O; and Fc = 19 N at C,
3.0 m from O. What is the net
torque about O?

°47 SSM A small ball of mass
0.75 kg is attached to one end
of a 1.25-m-long massless rod,
and the other end of the rod is hung from a pivot. When the resulting
pendulum is 30° from the vertical, what is the magnitude of the gravi-
tational torque calculated about the pivot?

ward force of 111 N is applied to the pedal by the rider. What is the
magnitude of the torque about the pedal arm’s pivot when the arm

speed about her center of mass changes from zero to 6.20 rad/s in 220
ms. Her rotational inertia about her center of mass is 12.0 kg-m?.

lar acceleration and (b) the average external

about its central axis through point O. Forces are applied as shown:
F, = 6.0N, F, =4.0N, F; = 2.0N, and F, = 5.0N. Also, r = 5.0. cm
and R = 12 cm. Find the (a) magnitude and (b) direction of the an-
gular acceleration of the cylinder. (During the rotation, the forces
maintain their same angles relative to the cylinder.)

disk that can rotate around its center like a
merry-go-round. The disk has a radius of A

2.00 cm and a mass of 20.0 grams and is ini- /2

54 <8 In a judo foot-sweep E

move, you sweep your opponent’s
left foot out from under him while

pulling on his gi (uniform) toward a
that side. As a result, your oppo- en aX
nent rotates around his right foot Q v

and onto the mat. Figure 10-44 h
shows a simplified diagram of

your opponent as you face him,

with his left foot swept out. The

rotational axis is through point O.

The gravitational force F,on him _ =

effectively acts at his center of a

mass, which is a horizontal dis-
tance d = 28 cm from point O. His
mass is 70 kg, and his rotational in-
ertia about point O is 65 kg-m’. What is the magnitude of his initial
angular acceleration about point O if your pull F, on his gi is (a) neg-
ligible and (b) horizontal with a magnitude of 300 N and applied at
height h = 1.4m?
