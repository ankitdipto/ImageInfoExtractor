Module 10-8 Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy

°58 (a) If R= 12cm, M = 400 g, and m = 50 g in Fig. 10-19, find
the speed of the block after it has descended 50 cm starting from
rest. Solve the problem using energy conservation principles.
(b) Repeat (a) with R = 5.0 cm.

*59 An automobile crankshaft transfers energy from the engine
to the axle at the rate of 100 hp (= 74.6 kW) when rotating at a
speed of 1800 rev/min. What torque (in newton-meters) does the
crankshaft deliver?

*60 A thin rod of length 0.75 m and mass 0.42 kg is suspended
freely from one end. It is pulled to one side and then allowed to swing
like a pendulum, passing through its lowest position with angular
speed 4.0 rad/s. Neglecting friction and air resistance, find (a) the
rod’s kinetic energy at its lowest position and (b) how far above that
position the center of mass rises.

*61 A.32.0 kg wheel, essentially a thin hoop with radius 1.20 m, is
rotating at 280 rev/min. It must be brought to a stop in 15.0s.
(a) How much work must be done to stop it? (b) What is the
required average power?

62 _ In Fig. 10-35, three 0.0100 kg particles have been glued toa
rod of length L=6.00cm and negligible mass and can rotate
around a perpendicular axis through point O at one end. How
much work is required to change the rotational rate (a) from 0 to
20.0 rad/s, (b) from 20.0 rad/s to 40.0 rad/s, and (c) from 40.0 rad/s to
60.0 rad/s? (d) What is the slope of a plot of the assembly’s kinetic
energy (in joules) versus the square of its rotation rate (in radians-
squared per second-squared)?

°°63 SSM ILW A meter stick is held vertically with one end on
the floor and is then allowed to fall. Find the speed of the other end
just before it hits the floor, assuming that the end on the floor does

servation of energy principle.)

 

PROBLEMS 291

64 A uniform cylinder of radius 10cm and mass 20kg is
mounted so as to rotate freely about a horizontal axis that is paral-
lel to and 5.0 cm from the central longitudinal axis of the cylinder.
(a) What is the rotational inertia of the cylinder about the axis of
rotation? (b) If the cylinder is released from rest with its central
longitudinal axis at the same height as the axis about which the
cylinder rotates, what is the angular speed of the cylinder as it
passes through its lowest position?

65 @ <= A tall, cylindrical chimney falls over when its base
is ruptured. Treat the chimney as a thin rod of length 55.0 m. At the
instant it makes an angle of 35.0° with the vertical as it falls, what
are (a) the radial acceleration of the top, and (b) the tangential ac-
celeration of the top. (Hint: Use energy considerations, not a torque.)
(c) At what angle dis the tangential acceleration equal to g?

66 © A uniform spherical shell of mass M = 4.5 kg and radius
R =8.5 cm can rotate about a vertical axis on frictionless bearings
(Fig, 10-47). A massless cord passes around the equator of the shell,
over a pulley of rotational inertia J = 3.0 X 10- kgm? and radius
r =5.0cm, and is attached to a small object of mass m = 0.60 kg.
There is no friction on the pulley’s axle; the cord does not slip on
the pulley. What is the speed of the object when it has fallen 82 cm
after being released from rest? Use energy considerations.

+67 @ Figure 10-48 shows a rigid as-
sembly of a thin hoop (of mass m and ra-
dius R = 0.150 m) and a thin radial rod
(of mass m and length L = 2.00R). The
assembly is upright, but if we give it a
slight nudge, it will rotate around a hori-
zontal axis in the plane of the rod and
hoop, through the lower end of the rod.
Assuming that the energy given to the
assembly in such a nudge is negligible,
what would be the assembly’s angular speed about the rotation axis
when it passes through the upside-down (inverted) orientation?
