83 In Fig. 10-41, two blocks, of mass m, = 400 g and m, = 600 g, are
connected by a massless cord that is wrapped around a uniform disk
of mass M = 500 g and radius R = 12.0 cm. The disk can rotate with-
out friction about a fixed horizontal axis through its center; the cord
cannot slip on the disk. The system is released from rest. Find (a) the
magnitude of the acceleration of the blocks, (b) the tension T; in the
cordat the left, and (c) the tension 7 in the cord at the right.

84 SE At 7:14 a.m. on June 30, 1908, a huge explosion
occurred above remote central Siberia, at latitude 61° N and lon-
gitude 102° E; the fireball thus created was the brightest flash
seen by anyone before nuclear weapons. The Tunguska Event,
which according to one chance witness “covered an enormous part
of the sky,” was probably the explosion of a stony asteroid about 140
m wide. (a) Considering only Earth’s rotation, determine how much
later the asteroid would have had to arrive to put the explosion
above Helsinki at longitude 25° E. This would have obliterated the
city. (b) If the asteroid had, instead, been a metallic asteroid, it could
have reached Earth’s surface. How much later would such an
asteroid have had to arrive to put the impact in the Atlantic Ocean
at longitude 20° W? (The resulting tsunamis would have wiped out
coastal civilization on both sides of the Atlantic.)

go-round), where another rod of negligible mass _ Figure 10-54
