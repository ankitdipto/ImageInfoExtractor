11.03 Calculate the kinetic energy of a body in smooth rolling as
the sum of the translational kinetic energy of the center of mass
and the rotational kinetic energy around the center of mass.

11.04 Apply the relationship between the work done ona
smoothly rolling object and the change in its kinetic energy.

11.05 For smooth rolling (and thus no sliding), conserve me-
chanical energy to relate initial energy values to the values
at a later point.

Key Ideas
@ A smoothly rolling wheel has kinetic energy
K = oom? + MVFcq
where J, is the rotational inertia of the wheel about its cen-
ter of mass and M is the mass of the wheel.
@ If the wheel is being accelerated but is still rolling smoothly,

the acceleration of the center of mass @,,,, is related to the

11.06 Draw a free-body diagram of an accelerating body that is
smoothly rolling on a horizontal surface or up or down a ramp.
11.07 Apply the relationship between the center-of-mass
acceleration and the angular acceleration.
11.08 For smooth rolling of an object up or down a
ramp, apply the relationship between the object's
acceleration, its rotational inertia, and the angle of
the ramp.

The Kinetic Energy of Rolling

Let us now calculate the kinetic energy of the rolling wheel as measured by the
stationary observer. If we view the rolling as pure rotation about an axis through
P in Fig. 11-6, then from Eq. 10-34 we have

K = jlo”, (11-3)

in which w is the angular speed of the wheel and Jp is the rotational inertia of the
wheel about the axis through P. From the parallel-axis theorem of Eq. 10-36
(I = Icom + Mh’), we have

Ip = Teom + MR?, (11-4)

in which M is the mass of the wheel, J, is its rotational inertia about an axis
through its center of mass, and R (the wheel’s radius) is the perpendicular
distance h. Substituting Eq. 11-4 into Eq. 11-3, we obtain

K = shom@? + $MR70?,

and using the relation Vom = @R (Eq. 11-2) yields

K = doom @? + $MV 2m (11-5)

‘We can interpret the term $Leom as the kinetic energy associated with the
rotation of the wheel about an axis through its center of mass (Fig. 11-4a), and the
term 3MV25m as the kinetic energy associated with the translational motion of the
wheel's center of mass (Fig. 11-4b).Thus, we have the following rule:

Ok) A rolling object has two types of kinetic energy: a rotational kinetic energy
Glo?) due to its rotation about its center of mass and a translational kinetic
energy (3Mv2m) due to translation of its center of mass.
