Sample Problem 11.01 Ball rolling down a ramp

A uniform ball, of mass M = 6.00kg and radius R, rolls
smoothly from rest down a ramp at angle @ = 30.0° (Fig. 11-8).
(a) The ball descends a vertical height h = 1.20 m to reach the
bottom of the ramp. What is its speed at the bottom?

KEY IDEAS

 

The mechanical energy E of the ball—Earth system is con-
served as the ball rolls down the ramp. The reason is that the
only force doing work on the ball is the gravitational force, a
conservative force. The normal force on the ball from the
ramp does zero work because it is perpendicular to the
ball’s path. The frictional force on the ball from the ramp
does not transfer any energy to thermal energy because the
ball does not slide (it rolls smoothly).
Thus, we conserve mechanical energy (E; = E;):

Ky + U;= Ki + Ui, (11-11)

where subscripts f and i refer to the final values (at the
bottom) and initial values (at rest), respectively. The gravita-
tional potential energy is initially U; = Mgh (where M is the
ball’s mass) and finally U; = 0. The kinetic energy is initially
K; = 0. For the final kinetic energy K;, we need an addi-
tional idea: Because the ball rolls, the kinetic energy in-
volves both translation and rotation, so we include them
both by using the right side of Eq. 11-5.
Calculations: Substituting into Eq. 11-11 gives us
Geom” + 5MVv25m) + 0 = 0 + Mgh, (11-12)

where J,,m is the ball’s rotational inertia about an axis
through its center of mass, V.om is the requested speed at the
bottom, and w is the angular speed there.

Because the ball rolls smoothly, we can use Eq. 11-2 to
substitute Vigq/R for w to reduce the unknowns in Eq. 11-12.

Doing so, substituting 2MR> for Icom (from Table 10-2f), and
then solving for Vcom give us

= VA@)gh = V(2)(9.8 m/s*)(1.20 m)

= 4.10 m/s.
Note that the answer does not depend on M or R.

(b) What are the magnitude and direction of the frictional
force on the ball as it rolls down the ramp?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the ball rolls smoothly, Eq. 11-9 gives the frictional
force on the ball.

Calculations: Before we can use Eq. 11-9, we need the
ball’s acceleration dom,. from Eq. 11-10:

__ gsin 0 __ gsin 0
Geom ~~ TF Toom/MR2 1+ MIPIM?

Note that we needed neither mass M nor radius R to find
com x- Thus, any size ball with any uniform mass would have
this smoothly rolling acceleration down a 30.0° ramp.

‘We can now solve Eq. 11-9 as

fs = ~hom

(Answer)

Note that we needed mass M but not radius R. Thus, the
frictional force on any 6.00 kg ball rolling smoothly down
a 30.0° ramp would be 8.40 N regardless of the ball’s ra-
dius but would be larger for a larger mass.

down its string.

11.10 Identify that a yo-yo is effectively an object that rolls
smoothly up or down a ramp with an incline angle of 90°.

Key Idea

11.11 For a yo-yo moving up or down its string, apply the rela-
tionship between the yo-yo's acceleration and its rotational
inertia.

11.12 Determine the tension in a yo-yo's string as the yo-yo
moves up or down its string.

 

@ A yo-yo, which travels vertically up or down a string, can be treated as a wheel rolling along an inclined plane at angle @ = 90°.
