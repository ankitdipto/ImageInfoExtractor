ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM

Sample Problem 11.02 Torque on a particle due to a force

In Fig. 11-11a, three forces, each of magnitude 2.0 N, act ona
particle. The particle is in the xz plane at point A given by
position vector 7, where r = 3.0 m and @ = 30°. What is the
torque, about the origin O, due to each force?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the three force vectors do not lie in a plane, we
must use cross products, with magnitudes given by Eq. 11-15
(7 = rF sin #) and directions given by the right-hand rule.

Calculations: Because we want the torques with respect to
the origin O, the vector 7 required for each cross product
is the given position vector. To determine the angle ¢ be-
tween 7 and each force, we shift the force vectors of Fig. 11-
11a, each in turn, so that their tails are at the origin. Figures
11-115, c, and d, which are direct views of the xz plane, show
the shifted force vectors F, F, and F, respectively. (Note
how much easier the angles between the force vectors and

the position vector are to see.) In Fig. 11-11d, the angle be-
tween the directions of 7 and Fy is 90° and the symbol ®@
means F; is directed into the page. (For out of the page, we
would use ©.)

Now, applying Eq. 11-15, we find

7 = rF, sin ¢; = (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 150°) = 3.0 N-m,
1 = rFysin ¢> = (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 120°) = 5.2 N-m,
and = = rF;sin d; = (3.0 m)(2.0 N)(sin 90°)
=6.0N-m. (Answer)

Next, we use the right-hand rule, placing the fingers of
the right hand so as to rotate 7 into F through the smaller of
the two angles between their directions. The thumb points in
the direction of the torque. Thus 7; is directed into the page in
Fig. 11-11b; 75 is directed out of the page in Fig. 11-11c; and
T; is directed as shown in Fig. 11-11d. All three torque vec-
tors are shown in Fig. 11-1le.
