ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM

to tail. From Fig. 11-12a, we see that Eq. 11-19 can be rewritten as

€=rp,=rmy,, (11-20)

where p, is the component of p perpendicular to 7 and v, is the component
of V perpendicular to 7. From Fig. 11-12b, we see that Eq. 11-19 can also be

rewritten as

€=rp=rm, (11-21)

where r, is the perpendicular distance between O and the extension of pj’.
Important. Note two features here: (1) angular momentum has meaning

only with respect to a specified origin and (2) its direction is always perpendicu-

lar to the plane formed by the position and linear momentum vectors 7 and p’.

lv] Checkpoint 4

In part a of the figure, particles 1 and 2 move around point O in circles
with radii 2 mand 4 m. In part b, particles 3 and 4 travel along straight
lines at perpendicular distances of 4 m and 2 m from point O. Particle 5
moves directly away from O. Alll five particles have the same mass and
the same constant speed. (a) Rank the particles according to the magni-
tudes of their angular momentum about point O, greatest first. (b)
Which particles have negative angular momentum about point O?

 

Sample Problem 11.03 Angular momentum of a two-particle system

Figure 11-13 shows an overhead view of two particles moving
at constant momentum along horizontal paths. Particle 1, with
momentum magnitude p, = 5.0 kg-m/s, has position vector 7;
and will pass 2.0 m from point O. Particle 2, with momentum
magnitude p, = 2.0 kg -m/s, has position vector 7} and will pass
4.0 m from point O. What are the magnitude and direction of
the net angular momentum L about point O of the two-
particle system?

KEY IDEA

To find L, we can first find the individual angular momenta
re and @ and then add them. To evaluate their magnitudes,
we can use any one of Egs. 11-18 through 11-21. However,
Eg. 11-21 is easiest, because we are given the perpendicular
distances r,; (= 2.0 m) and r,5 (= 4.0m) and the momen-
tum magnitudes p, and p>.

Calculations: For particle 1,Eq. 11-21 yields
€; =rypi = (2.0 m)(5.0 kg- m/s)
= 10kg-m7s.
To find the direction of vector 4, we use Eq. 11-18 and the
right-hand rule for vector products. For 7; X pj, the vector
product is out of the page, perpendicular to the plane of

Fig. 11-13. This is the positive direction, consistent with the
counterclockwise rotation of the particle’s position vector

F, around O as particle 1 moves. Thus, the angular momen-
tum vector for particle 1 is

€, = +10kg-m7/s.
Similarly, the magnitude of Cris
€y = rp = (4.0m)(2.0 kg: m/s)
= 8.0 kg-m’/s,
and the vector product 7; X p> is into the page, which is the
negative direction, consistent with the clockwise rotation of

Fy around O as particle 2 moves. Thus, the angular momen-
tum vector for particle 2 is

€, = —8.0 kg-m’/s.
The net angular momentum for the two-particle system is
L=,+ € = +10kg-m*/s + (—8.0 kg: m7/s)
= +2.0kg-m’/s. (Answer)

The plus sign means that the system’s net angular momen-
tum about point O is out of the page.
