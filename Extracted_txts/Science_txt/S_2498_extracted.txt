the generic cross product. Because 7 lacks any z component
and because ¥ lacks any y or z component, the only nonzero
term in the generic cross product is the very last one (—_b,a,)k.
So, let’s cut to the (mathematical) chase by writing

7 X V = —(—4.00r — 1.00)(5.00)k = (20.0r + 5.00)k m/s.

Note that, as always, the cross product produces a vector
that is perpendicular to the original vectors.

To finish up Eq. 11-18, we multiply by the mass, finding

€ = (0.500 kg)[(20.0r + 5.00)k m/s]

= (10.0 + 2.50)kkg: m2/s. (Answer)

The torque about the origin then immediately follows from

which is in the positive direction of the z axis.

Our result for € tells us that the angular momentum is
in the positive direction of the z axis. To make sense of that
positive result in terms of the rotation of the position vector,

t=1.00s, 7, = ~3.00i + 5.00jm
t=2.00s, 7, = —10.0i + 5.00jm

By drawing these results as in Fig. 11-14), we see that 7 ro-
tates counterclockwise in order to keep up with the particle.
That is the positive direction of rotation. Thus, even though
the particle is moving in a straight line, it is still moving
counterclockwise around the origin and thus has a positive
angular momentum.

We can also make sense of the direction of € by applying
the right-hand rule for cross products (here 7 X V, or, if you
like, mr X V, which gives the same direction). For any mo-
ment during the particle’s motion, the fingers of the right
hand are first extended in the direction of the first vector in
the cross product (7) as indicated in Fig. 11-14c. The orienta-
tion of the hand (on the page or viewing screen) is then ad-
justed so that the fingers can be comfortably rotated about
the palm to be in the direction of the second vector in the
cross product (¥) as indicated in Fig. 11-14d. The outstretched
thumb then points in the direction of the result of the cross
product. As indicated in Fig. 11-14e, the vector is in the posi-
tive direction of the z axis (which is directly out of the plane
of the figure), consistent with our previous result. Figure
11-14e also indicates the direction of 7, which is also in the
positive direction of the z axis because the angular momen-
tum is in that direction and is increasing in magnitude.
