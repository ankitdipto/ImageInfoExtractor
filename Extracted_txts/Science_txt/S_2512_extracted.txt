°36 Figure 11-43 shows three rotating, uniform disks that are cou-
pled by belts. One belt runs around the rims of disks A and C. Another
belt runs around a central hub on disk A and the rim of disk B. The
belts move smoothly without slippage on the rims and hub. Disk A has
radius R; its hub has radius 0.5000R; disk B has radius 0.2500R; and
disk C has radius 2.000R. Disks B and C have the same density (mass
per unit volume) and thickness. What is the ratio of the magnitude of
the angular momentum of disk C to that of disk B?

°43 In Fig. 11-47, two skaters, each

of mass 50 kg, approach each other 6

along parallel paths separated by

3.0 m. They have opposite velocities — ~~)
of 14 ms each. One skater carries y
one end of a long pole of negligible
mass, and the other skater grabs the
other end as she passes. The skaters
then rotate around the center of the pole. Assume that the friction
between skates and ice is negligible. What are (a) the radius of the
circle, (b) the angular speed of the skaters, and (c) the kinetic energy
of the two-skater system? Next, the skaters pull along the pole until
they are separated by 1.0m. What then are (d) their angular speed
and (e) the kinetic energy of the system? (f) What provided the en-
ergy for the increased kinetic energy?
