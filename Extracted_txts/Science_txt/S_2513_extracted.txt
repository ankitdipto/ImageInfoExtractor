°47 ssM A track is mounted on a
large wheel that is free to turn with
negligible friction about a vertical
axis (Fig, 11-48). A toy train of mass
mis placed on the track and, with the
system initially at rest, the train's
electrical power is turned on. The train reaches speed 0.15 m/s with
respect to the track. What is the wheel’s angular speed if its mass is
1.1m and its radius is 0.43 m? (Treat it as a hoop, and neglect the
mass of the spokes and hub.)

°48 A Texas cockroach walks from
the center of a circular disk (that ro- @,
tates like a merry-go-round without

external torques) out to the edge at
radius R. The angular speed of the = 0,

cockroach-disk system for the walk is
given in Fig, 11-49 (@, = 5.0 rad/s and 0 R

of the disk does the cockroach have?

*49 Two disks are mounted (like a merry-go-round) on low-
friction bearings on the same axle and can be brought together so
that they couple and rotate as one unit. The first disk, with rota-
tional inertia 3.30 kg-m? about its central axis, is set spinning coun-
terclockwise at 450 rev/min. The second disk, with rotational inertia
6.60 kg-m? about its central axis, is set spinning counterclockwise
at 900 rev/min. They then couple together. (a) What is their angular
speed after coupling? If instead the second disk is set spinning
clockwise at 900 rev/min, what are their (b) angular speed and
(c) direction of rotation after they couple together?

°50 The rotor of an electric motor has rotational inertia /,, =
2.0 X 10-3kg- m? about its central axis. The motor is used to
change the orientation of the space probe in which it is mounted.
The motor axis is mounted along the central axis of the probe; the
probe has rotational inertia J,=12kg-m’ about this axis.
Calculate the number of revolutions of the rotor required to turn

the probe through 30° about its central axis.

°51 SSM ILW A wheel is rotating freely at angular speed
800 rev/min on a shaft whose rotational inertia is negligible. A sec-
ond wheel, initially at rest and with twice the rotational inertia of the
first, is suddenly coupled to the same shaft. (a) What is the angular
speed of the resultant combination of the shaft and two wheels?
(b) What fraction of the original rotational kinetic energy is lost?

+52 © A cockroach of mass m lies on the rim of a uniform disk of
mass 4.00m that can rotate freely about its center like a merry-go-
round. Initially the cockroach and disk rotate together with an angu-
lar velocity of 0.260 rad/s. Then the cockroach walks halfway to the
center of the disk. (a) What then is the angular velocity of the cock-
roach-disk system? (b) What is the ratio K/K of the new kinetic en-
ergy of the system to its initial kinetic energy? (c) What accounts for
the change in the kinetic energy?

+53 © In Fig. 11-50 (an overhead
view), a uniform thin rod of length
0.500 m and mass 4.00 kg can rotate
in a horizontal plane about a verti-
cal axis through its center. The rod is
at rest when a 3.00g bullet traveling
in the rotation plane is fired into one
end of the rod. In the view from

ROLLING, TORQUE, AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM

above, the bullet’s path makes angle @= 60.0° with the rod (Fig, 11-
50). If the bullet lodges in the rod and the angular velocity of the rod
is 10 rad/s immediately after the collision, what is the bullet’s speed
just before impact?

54 @ Figure 11-51 shows an
overhead view of a ring that can
rotate about its center like a merry-

go-round. Its outer radius R is

0.800 m, its inner radius R; is R,/2.00, WN

its mass M is 8.00 kg, and the mass of
the crossbars at its center is neg-
ligible. It initially rotates at an angu-
lar speed of 8.00 rad/s with a cat of
mass m = M/4.00 on its outer edge, at
radius Rj. By how much does the cat increase the kinetic energy of
the cat—ring system if the cat crawls to the inner edge, at radius R,?

#55 A horizontal vinyl record of mass 0.10 kg and radius 0.10 m
rotates freely about a vertical axis through its center with an angu-
lar speed of 4.7 rad/s and a rotational inertia of 5.0 X 10-4 kg-m?.
Putty of mass 0.020 kg drops vertically onto the record from above
and sticks to the edge of the record. What is the angular speed of
the record immediately afterwards?

56 <= In a long jump, an athlete leaves the ground with an
initial angular momentum that tends to rotate her body forward,
threatening to ruin her landing, To counter this tendency, she rotates
her outstretched arms to “take up” the angular momentum (Fig. 11-
18). In 0.700 s, one arm sweeps through 0.500 rev and the other arm
sweeps through 1.000 rev. Treat each arm as a thin rod of mass 4.0 kg
and length 0.60 m, rotating around one end. In the athlete's reference
frame, what is the magnitude of the total angular momentum of the
arms around the common rotation axis through the shoulders?

57 A uniform disk of mass 10m and radius 3.0r can rotate
freely about its fixed center like a merry-go-round. A smaller uni-
form disk of mass m and radius r lies on top of the larger disk,
concentric with it. Initially the two disks rotate together with an an-
gular velocity of 20 rad/s. Then a slight disturbance causes the smaller
disk to slide outward across the larger disk, until the outer edge of the
smaller disk catches on the outer edge of the larger disk. Afterward,
the two disks again rotate together (without further sliding). (a) What
then is their angular velocity about the center of the larger disk? (b)
What is the ratio K/K, of the new kinetic energy of the two-disk sys-
tem to the system’s initial kinetic energy?

58 A horizontal platform in the shape of a circular disk rotates on
a frictionless bearing about a vertical axle through the center of the
disk. The platform has a mass of 150 kg, a radius of 2.0m, and a rota-
tional inertia of 300 kg -m? about the axis of rotation. A 60 kg student
walks slowly from the rim of the platform toward the center. If the an-
gular speed of the system is 1.5 rad/s when the student starts at the
rim, what is the angular speed when she is 0.50 m from the center?

pendicular to the rod at the instant of ejection. If the particle’s speed
v, is 6.00 m/s greater than the speed of the rod end just after ejec-
tion, what is the value of v,?
