60 In Fig. 11-53,a 1.0 g bulletiis fired A
into a 0.50 kg block attached to the end
of a 0.60m nonuniform rod of mass
0.50 kg, The block—rod—bullet system
then rotates in the plane of the figure,
about a fixed axis at A. The rotational
inertia of the rod alone about that axis
at A is 0.060 kg -m”. Treat the block as a
particle. (a) What then is the rotational
inertia of the block—rod—bullet system
about point A? (b) If the angular speed
of the system about A just after impact
is 4.5 rad/s, what is the bullet’s speed
just before impact?

“61 The uniform rod (length 0.60 m,
mass 1.0kg) in Fig, 11-54 rotates in the
plane of the figure about an axis through
one end, with a rotational inertia of 0.12
kg-m’. As the rod swings through its
lowest position, it collides with a 0.20 kg
putty wad that sticks to the end of the
rod. If the rod’s angular speed just before
collision is 2.4 rad/s, what is the angular
speed of the rod—putty system immedi-
ately after collision?

lar speed @ and a rotational inertia consisting of two parts:
Joy = 1.44 kgm for her leg extended outward at angle 6 = 90.0°
to her body and Jy, = 0.660 kg +m? for the rest of her body (pri-
marily her trunk). Near her maximum height she holds both legs at
angle 6 = 30.0° to her body and has angular speed «; (Fig. 11-196).

65 SSM WWW Two 2.00kg balls are attached to the ends of a
thin rod of length 50.0 cm and negli-
gible mass. The rod is free to rotate in
a vertical plane without friction
about a horizontal axis through its
center. With the rod initially horizon-
tal (Fig. 11-57), a 50.0g wad of wet
putty drops onto one of the balls, hit-
ting it with a speed of 3.00 m/s and then sticking to it. (a) What is the
angular speed of the system just after the putty wad hits? (b) What is
the ratio of the kinetic energy of the system after the collision to that
of the putty wad just before? (c) Through what angle will the system
rotate before it momentarily stops?

66 @ In Fig. 11-58, a small 50g
block slides down a frictionless sur-
face through height = 20cm and
then sticks to a uniform rod of mass
100 g and length 40 cm. The rod pivots
about point O through angle @

67 @ Figure 11-59 is an over-
head view of a thin uniform rod of
length 0.600 m and mass M rotating
horizontally at 80.0 rad/s counter-
clockwise about an axis through its center. A particle of mass
M/3.00 and traveling horizontally at speed 40.0 m/s hits the rod
and sticks. The particle’s path is perpendicular to the rod at the
instant of the hit, at a distance d from the rod’s center. (a) At
what value of d are rod and particle stationary after the hit?
(b) In which direction do rod and particle rotate if d is greater
than this value?

Module 11-9 Precession of a Gyroscope

68 A top spins at 30 rev/s about an axis that makes an angle of
30° with the vertical. The mass of the top is 0.50 kg, its rotational in-
ertia about its central axis is 5.0 X 10-+kg-m/, and its center of
mass is 4.0 cm from the pivot point. If the spin is clockwise from an
overhead view, what are the (a) precession rate and (b) direction of
the precession as viewed from overhead?

“69 A certain gyroscope consists of a uniform disk with a 50cm
radius mounted at the center of an axle that is 11 cm long and of
negligible mass. The axle is horizontal and supported at one end. If
the spin rate is 1000 rev/min, what is the precession rate?
