sion with a 4.00 kg particle that is moving horizontally over the

81 SSM A uniform wheel
of mass 10.0 kg and radius
0.400 m is mounted rigidly
on a massless axle through
its center (Fig. 11-62). The
radius of the axle is 0.200

nation about its central axis
is 0.600 kg-m?. The wheel is
initially at rest at the top of a surface that is inclined at angle 9 =
30.0° with the horizontal; the axle rests on the surface while the
wheel extends into a groove in the surface without touching the
surface. Once released, the axle rolls down along the surface
smoothly and without slipping. When the wheel-axle combination
has moved down the surface by 2.00 m, what are (a) its rotational
