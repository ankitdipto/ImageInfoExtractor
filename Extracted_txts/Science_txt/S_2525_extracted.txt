Choosing the
rotation axis
here eliminates
the torques
due to these
forces.

These horizontal
forces balance.

(it is the horizontal dashed line shown in Fig. 12-7c). Then r,
is the perpendicular distance between O and the line of ac-
tion. In Fig. 12-7c, r, extends along the y axis and is equal to
the height h. We similarly draw lines of action for the gravita-
tional force vectors Mg and mg’ and see that their moment
arms extend along the x axis. For the distance a shown in Fig.
12-7a, the moment arms are a/2 (the firefighter is halfway up
the ladder) and a/3 (the ladder’s center of mass is one-third of
the way up the ladder), respectively. The moment arms for F,,.
and ae are zero because the forces act at the origin.

Now, with torques written in the form r, F,the balancing
equation Ty. = 0 becomes

—(h)(F) + (a/2)(Mg) + (a/3)(mg)

+ (O)(Fox) + (O)(Fpy) = 0. (12-21)
(A positive torque corresponds to counterclockwise rotation
and a negative torque corresponds to clockwise rotation.)

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle
made by the ladder in Fig. 11-7a, we find that

a= VI? —f =758m.

Then Eq. 12-21 gives us

9.8 mis?)(7.58 m)(72/2 kg + 45/3 kg)
9.3m
= 407N~410N. (Answer)

Now we need to use the force balancing equations and
Fig. 12-7d.The equation F).;,, = 0 gives us

ed rd Os
so F,, = Fy = 410N. (Answer)
The equation Fy. = 0 gives us
Fy — Mg — mg = 0,
so. Fy =(M + m)g = (72 kg + 45 kg)(9.8 m/s”)

= 11466N ~ 1100N. (Answer)
