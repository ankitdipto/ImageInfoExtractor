Sample Problem 12.05 Stress and strain of elongated rod

One end of a steel rod of radius R=9.5 mm and length
L=81 cm is held in a vise. A force of magnitude
F = 62 kN is then applied perpendicularly to the end face
(uniformly across the area) at the other end, pulling di-
rectly away from the vise. What are the stress on the rod
and the elongation AL and strain of the rod?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Because the force is perpendicular to the end face and
uniform, the stress is the ratio of the magnitude F of the
force to the area A. The ratio is the left side of Eq. 12-23.
(2) The elongation AL is related to the stress and Young’s
modulus E by Eq. 12-23 (F/A = E AL/L). (3) Strain is the
ratio of the elongation to the initial length L.

Calculations: To find the stress, we write

Sample Problem 12.06 Balancing a wobbly table

A table has three legs that are 1.00 m in length and a fourth
leg that is longer by d = 0.50 mm, so that the table wobbles
slightly. A steel cylinder with mass M = 290 kg is placed
on the table (which has a mass much less than M) so that
all four legs are compressed but unbuckled and the table
is level but no longer wobbles. The legs are wooden cylin-
ders with cross-sectional area A = 1.0 cm?; Young’s mod-
ulus is E = 1.3 x 10!° N/m’. What are the magnitudes of the
forces on the legs from the floor?

KEY IDEAS

We take the table plus steel cylinder as our system. The situ-
ation is like that in Fig. 12-9, except now we have a steel
cylinder on the table. If the tabletop remains level, the legs
must be compressed in the following ways: Each of the short
legs must be compressed by the same amount (call it AL)
and thus by the same force of magnitude F;. The single long
leg must be compressed by a larger amount AL, and thus by
a force with a larger magnitude F,. In other words, for a
level tabletop, we must have
AL,= AL, +d. (12-26)
From Eq. 12-23, we can relate a change in length to the
force causing the change with AL = FL/AE, where L is the
original length of a leg. We can use this relation to replace ALy
and AL, in Eq. 12-26. However, note that we can approximate
the original length L as being the same for all four legs.

Calculations: Making those replacements and that approxi-

The yield strength for structural steel is 2.5 x 10°N/m?, so
this rod is dangerously close to its yield strength.

‘We cannot solve this equation because it has two unknowns,
F,and F;.

To get a second equation containing F, and F3, we can use
a vertical y axis and then write the balance of vertical forces
(Footy = 0) as

3F, + Fy— Mg=0, (12-28)

where Mg is equal to the magnitude of the gravitational force
on the system. (Three legs have force F, on them.) To solve
the simultaneous equations 12-27 and 12-28 for, say, Fy, we
first use Eq. 12-28 to find that F, = Mg — 3F;. Substituting
that into Eq. 12-27 then yields, after some algebra,

From Eq. 12-28 we then find
F, = Mg — 3F; = (290 kg)(9.8 m/s?) — 3(548 N)
=12kN (Answer)

You can show that the three short legs are each compressed
by 0.42 mm and the single long leg by 0.92 mm.
