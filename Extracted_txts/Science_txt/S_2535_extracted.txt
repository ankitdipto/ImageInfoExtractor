°12 In Fig. 12-30, trying to get his car out of mud, a man ties one
end of a rope around the front bumper and the other end tightly
around a utility pole 18 m away. He then pushes sideways on the
rope at its midpoint with a force of 550 N, displacing the center of
the rope 0.30 m, but the car barely moves. What is the magnitude of
the force on the car from the rope? (The rope stretches somewhat.)

°13 Figure 12-31 shows the
anatomical structures in the
lower leg and foot that are
involved in standing on tip-
toe, with the heel raised
slightly off the floor so that
the foot effectively contacts
the floor only at point P.
Assume distance a= 5.0 cm,
distance b= 15cm, and the
person’s weight W=900N.
Of the forces acting on the
foot, what are the (a) magni-
tude and (b) direction (up or down) of the force at point A from
the calf muscle and the (c) magnitude and (d) direction (up or
down) of the force at point B from the lower leg bones?

form mass 50.0kg, is suspended
from a building by two cables. The
scaffold has dozens of paint cans
stacked on it at various points. The total mass of the paint cans is
75.0 kg. The tension in the cable at the right is 722 N. How far
horizontally from that cable is the center of mass of the system of
paint cans?

*15 iw Forces F,, F,, and F, act on the structure of Fig. 12-33,
shown in an overhead view. We wish to put the structure in equilib-
rium by applying a fourth force, at a point such as P. The fourth
force has vector components F;, and F,. We are given that a = 2.0 m,
b =3.0m,c = 1.0m, F, = 20N,F, = 10 Nand F; = 5.0 N.Find (a)
F,,(b) F,,and (c) d.

°16 A uniform cubical crate is 0.750 m on each side and weighs
500 N. It rests on a floor with one edge against a very small, fixed
obstruction. At what least height above the floor must a horizontal
force of magnitude 350 N be applied to the crate to tip it?

CHAPTER 12 EQUILIBRIUM AND ELASTICITY

°17 In Fig. 12-34, a uniform beam of
weight 500N and length 3.0 m is sus-
pended horizontally. On the left it is
hinged to a wall; on the right it is sup-
ported by a cable bolted to the wall at
distance D above the beam. The least
tension that will snap the cable is 1200
N. (a) What value of D corresponds to
that tension? (b) To prevent the cable
from snapping, should D be increased
or decreased from that value?

18 @ In Fig. 12-35, horizontal scaf-
fold 2, with uniform mass m = 30.0
kg and length L,=2.00m, hangs
from horizontal scaffold 1, with uni-
form mass m, = 50.0 kg. A 20.0 kg
box of nails lies on scaffold 2, cen-
tered at distance d = 0.500 m from
the left end. What is the tension T in
the cable indicated?

°19 To crack a certain nut in a nut-
cracker, forces with magnitudes of at
least 40 N must act on its shell from
both sides. For the nutcracker of Fig.
12-36, with distances L = 12 cm and
d=2.6cm, what are the force com-
ponents F, (perpendicular to the
handles) corresponding to that 40 N?

21 ILW The system in Fig, 12-38 is
in equilibrium. A concrete block of
mass 225 kg hangs from the end of
the uniform strut of mass 45.0 kg. A
cable runs from the ground, over
the top of the strut, and down to the
block, holding the block in place.
