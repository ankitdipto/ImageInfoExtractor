rock climber is in a lie-back climb
along fissure, with hands pulling on
one side of the fissure and feet
pressed against the opposite side.
The fissure has width w= 0.20m,
and the center of mass of the climber
is a horizontal distance d = 040m
from the fissure. The coefficient of
static friction between hands and
rock is 4; = 0.40, and between boots
and rock it is zy = 1.2. (a) What is the

least horizontal pull by the hands and push by the feet that
will keep the climber stable? (b) For the horizontal pull of
(a), what must be the vertical distance A between hands and feet?

If the climber encounters wet rock, so
that ; and pw are reduced, what hap-
pens to (c) the answer to (a) and (d)
the answer to (b)?

+23 @ In Fig. 12-40, one end of a
uniform beam of weight 222 N is
hinged to a wall; the other end is sup-
ported by a wire that makes angles
4 = 30.0° with both wall and beam.
Find (a) the tension in the wire and the
(b) horizontal and (c) vertical compo-
nents of the force of the hinge on the
beam.

24 @ <Me In Fig. 12-41, a climber
with a weight of 533.8 N is held by a
belay rope connected to her climbing
harness and belay device: the force of
the rope on her has a line of action
through her center of mass. The indi-
cated angles are @=40.0° and $=
30.0°. If her feet are on the verge of
sliding on the vertical wall, what is the
coefficient of static friction between
her climbing shoes and the wall?

25 SSM WWW In Fig. 12-42, what
magnitude of (constant) force F ap-
plied horizontally at the axle of the
wheel is necessary to raise the wheel
over a step obstacle of height
h = 3.00 cm? The wheel's radius is r=
6.00 cm, and its mass is m = 0.800 kg.

27 @ In Fig. 12-44, a 15 kg block is
held in place via a pulley system. The
person’s upper arm is vertical; the fore-
arm is at angle @ = 30° with the horizon-
tal. Forearm and hand together have a
mass of 2.0 kg, with a center of mass at dis-
tance d, = 15 cm from the contact point of
the forearm bone and the upper-arm bone
(humerus). The triceps muscle pulls verti-

contact point. Distance d; is 35 cm. What are the (a) magnitude and
(b) direction (up or down) of the force on the forearm from the tri-
ceps muscle and the (c) magnitude and (d) direction (up or down) of

the force on the forearm from the humerus?

“28 @ In Rig. 12-45, suppose the
length L of the uniform bar is 3.00 m
and its weight is 200. Also, let the
block’s weight W = 300 N and the an-
gle 6 = 30.0°. The wire can withstand
a maximum tension of 500 N. (a) What
is the maximum possible distance x
before the wire breaks? With the
block placed at this maximum x, what
are the (b) horizontal and (c) vertical
components of the force on the bar
from the hinge at A?

29 A door has a height of 2.1m
along a y axis that extends vertically
upward and a width of 0.91 m along an
x axis that extends outward from the
hinged edge of the door.A hinge 030m
from the top and a hinge 0.30m from
the bottom each support half the door’s
mass, which is 27kg. In unit-vector
notation, what are the forces on the
door at (a) the top hinge and (b) the
bottom hinge?

square sign, of edge length L = 2.00 m, is
hung from a horizontal rod of length
dj, = 3.00 m and negligible mass. A ca-
ble is attached to the end of the rod
