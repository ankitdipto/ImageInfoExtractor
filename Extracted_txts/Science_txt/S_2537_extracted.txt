and to a point on the wall at distance d, = 4.00 m above the point
where the rod is hinged to the wall. (a) What is the tension in the
cable? What are the (b) magnitude and (c) direction (left or right)
of the horizontal component of the force on the rod from the wall,
and the (d) magnitude and (e) direction (up or down) of the verti-
cal component of this force?
31 @ In Fig. 12-47, a
nonuniform bar is suspended
at rest in a horizontal position
by two massless cords. One
cord makes the angle @=
36.9° with the vertical; the
other makes the angle ¢=
53.1° with the vertical. If the
length L of the bar is 6.10 m,
compute the distance x from
the left end of the bar to its center of mass.

°°32 In Fig. 12-48, the driver of a car on a horizontal road makes
an emergency stop by applying the brakes so that all four wheels
lock and skid along the road. The coefficient of kinetic friction be-
tween tires and road is 0.40. The separation between the front and
rear axles is L = 4.2 m, and the center of mass of the car is located
at distance d = 1.8 m behind the front axle and distance h = 0.75 m
above the road. The car weighs 11 KN. Find the magnitude of (a)
the braking acceleration of the car, (b) the normal force on each
rear wheel, (c) the normal force on each front wheel, (d) the brak-
ing force on each rear wheel, and (e) the braking force on each
front wheel. (Hint: Although the car is not in translational equilib-
rium, it is in rotational equilibrium.)

the beam at distance y from the lower end. The beam remains
vertical because of a cable attached at the upper end, at angle @
with the horizontal. Figure 12-49b gives the tension Tin the cable
as a function of the position of the applied force given asa fraction
y/L of the beam length. The scale of the T axis is set by T, = 600 N.
Figure 12-49c gives the magnitude F,, of the horizontal force on the
beam from the hinge, also as a function of y/L. Evaluate (a) angle @
and (b) the magnitude of F,.

+34 In Fig. 12-45, a thin horizontal bar AB of negligible weight
and length L is hinged to a vertical wall at A and supported at B
by a thin wire BC that makes an angle @ with the horizontal. A
block of weight W can be moved anywhere along the bar; its posi-
tion is defined by the distance x from the wall to its center of
mass. As a function of x, find (a) the tension in the wire, and the
(b) horizontal and (c) vertical components of the force on the bar
from the hinge at A.

°°35 SSM WWW A cubical boxis filled with sand and weighs 890
N. We wish to “roll” the box by pushing horizontally on one of the
upper edges. (a) What minimum force is required? (b) What mini-
mum coefficient of static friction between box and floor is re-
quired? (c) If there is a more efficient way to roll the box, find the
smallest possible force that would have to be applied directly to
the box to roll it. (Hint: At the onset of tipping, where is the normal
force located?)

°°36 <M Figure 12-50 shows a 70 kg climber
hanging by only the crimp hold of one hand on
the edge of a shallow horizontal ledge in a
rock wall. (The fingers are pressed down to
gain purchase.) Her feet touch the rock wall
at distance H=2.0 m directly below her
crimped fingers but do not provide any sup-
port. Her center of mass is distance a = 0.20
m from the wall. Assume that the force from
the ledge supporting her fingers is equally
shared by the four fingers. What are the values
of the (a) horizontal component F, and (b)
vertical component F, of the force on each
fingertip?

37 @ In Fig. 12-51, a uniform plank, with a
length L of 6.10 m and a weight of 445 N, rests
on the ground and against a frictionless roller at
the top of a wall of height h = 3.05 m. The plank
remains in equilibrium for any value of 6 = 70°
but slips if @ < 70°. Find the coefficient of static
friction between the plank and the ground.
