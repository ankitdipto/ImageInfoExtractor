+47 A tunnel of length L = 150 m, height H = 7.2 m, and width
5.8m (with a flat roof) is to be constructed at distance d = 60m
beneath the ground. (See Fig, 12-58.) The tunnel roof is to be sup-
ported entirely by square steel columns, each with a cross-sectional
area of 960 cmv. The mass of 1.0 cm’ of the ground material is 2.8 g,
(a) What is the total weight of the ground material the columns must
support? (b) How many columns are needed to keep the compres-
sive stress on each column at one-half its ultimate strength?

aluminum wire that is stretched
by a machine pulling in opposite
directions at the two ends of the
wire. The scale of the stress axis is
set by s = 7.0, in units of

sect, its volume remained constant. If the weight of the insect
puts the thread on the verge of breaking, what is the insect’s
mass? (A spider’s web is built to break if a potentially harmful in-
sect, such as a bumble bee, becomes snared in the web.)

compressed. Then force F of magnitude 220 N is applied perpendi-

Additional Problems

52 After a fall, a 95 kg rock climber finds himself dangling from
the end of a rope that had been 15 m long and 9.6 mm in diameter
but has stretched by 2.8 cm. For the rope, calculate (a) the strain,

(b) the stress, and (c) the Young’s modulus.

53 ssM In Fig. 12-63,a rectangular

slab of slate rests on a bedrock sur-

face inclined at angle @= 26°. The

slab has length L = 43 m, thickness Ch
T=25m,and width W=12m, and \ \

1.0 cm’ of it has a mass of 3.2 g. The
coefficient of static friction between
slab and bedrock is 0.39. (a)
Calculate the component of the
gravitational force on the slab parallel to the bedrock surface. (b)
Calculate the magnitude of the static frictional force on the slab.
By comparing (a) and (b), you can see that the slab is in danger of
sliding, This is prevented only by chance protrusions of bedrock.
(c) To stabilize the slab, bolts are to be driven perpendicular to the
bedrock surface (two bolts are shown). If each bolt has a cross-
sectional area of 6.4 cm? and will snap under a shearing stress of
3.6 X 108 N/m?, what is the minimum number of bolts needed?
Assume that the bolts do not affect the normal force.

54 A uniform ladder whose length

is 5.0m and whose weight is 400 N

leans against a frictionless vertical

wall. The coefficient of static friction

between the level ground and the

foot of the ladder is 0.46. What is the A
greatest distance the foot of the lad-
der can be placed from the base of
the wall without the ladder immedi-
ately slipping?

(mass 10 kg) is in equilibrium, but it
would slip if block B (mass 5.0 kg)
were any heavier. For angle @ = 30°,
what is the coefficient of static fric-
tion between block A and the sur-
face below it?
