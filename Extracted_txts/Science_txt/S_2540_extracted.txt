Atits left end, it is hinged to the building wall; at its right end, it has
a roller that can roll along the building wall. There is no vertical
force on the roller from the building, only a horizontal force with
magnitude F,, The horizontal distance between the buildings is
D = 4.00 m. The rise of the ramp is h = 0.490 m. A man walks
across the ramp from the left. Figure 12-65b gives F,, as a function
of the horizontal distance x of the man from the building at the
left. The scale of the Fj, axis is set by a = 20 KN and b = 25 KN.
What are the masses of (a) the ramp and (b) the man?

inclined at angle @= 45° from the

58 In Fig. 12-67a,a uniform 40.0 kg

Vertical lines across the beam mark
off equal lengths. Two of the lines are
centered over the rollers; a 10.0 kg
package of tamales is centered over
roller B. What are the magnitudes of
the forces on the beam from (a)
roller A and (b) roller B? The beam

right-hand end is centered over @

roller B (Fig. 12-67b). What now are

construction bucket is suspended
by a cable A that is attached at O
to two other cables B and C, mak-
ing angles 6, = 51.0° and @ = 66.0°
with the horizontal. Find the ten-
sions in (a) cable A, (b) cable B,
and (c) cable C. (Hint: To avoid
solving two equations in two un-
knowns, position the axes as
shown in the figure.)

60 In Fig. 12-69, a package of mass
m hangs from a short cord that is tied
to the wall via cord 1 and to the ceil-
ing via cord 2. Cord 1 is at angle 6 =
40° with the horizontal; cord 2 is at an-
gle @. (a) For what value of @ is the
tension in cord 2 minimized? (b) In
terms of mg, what is the minimum ten-
sion in cord 2?

61 ILW The force F in Fig. 12-70
keeps the 6.40 kg block and the pulleys in
equilibrium. The pulleys have negligible
mass and friction. Calculate the tension T in
the upper cable. (Hint: When a cable wraps
halfway around a pulley as here, the magni-
tude of its net force on the pulley is twice
the tension in the cable.)

62 A mine elevator is supported by a sin-
gle steel cable 2.5 cm in diameter. The total
mass of the elevator cage and occupants is
670 kg. By how much does the cable stretch
when the elevator hangs by (a) 12 m of ca-
ble and (b) 362m of cable? (Neglect the
mass of the cable.)

63 <8 Four bricks of length L, identi-

cal and uniform, are stacked on top of o1

another (Fig. 12-71) in such a way that

part of each extends beyond the

one beneath. Find, in terms of a

64 In Fig. 12-72, two identical, uni-
form, and frictionless spheres, each of
mass m, rest in a rigid rectangular con-
tainer. A line connecting their centers is
at 45° to the horizontal. Find the
magnitudes of the forces on the spheres
from (a) the bottom of the container,
(b) the left side of the container,
(c) the right side of the container, and
(d) each other. (Hint: The force of one
sphere on the other is directed along
the center—center line.) Figure 12-72 Problem 64.

65 In Fig. 12-73, a uniform beam z
with a weight of 60 N and a length of
3.2 m is hinged at its lower end, and
a horizontal force F of magnitude
50 N acts at its upper end. The beam
is held vertical by a cable that makes
angle @ = 25° with the ground and is
attached to the beam at height h =
2.0 m. What are (a) the tension in
the cable and (b) the force on the
beam from the hinge in unit-vector
notation?
