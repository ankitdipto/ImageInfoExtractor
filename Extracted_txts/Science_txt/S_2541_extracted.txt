66 A uniform beam is 5.0 m long
and has a mass of 53 kg, In Fig. 12-
74, the beam is supported in a hori-
zontal position by a hinge and a ca-
ble, with angle @= 60°. In unit-vector
notation, what is the force on the beam
from the hinge?

length of 85.5 cm. How much stress must be applied to the cube to

68 A construction worker at- Q
tempts to lift a uniform beam off the

floor and raise it to a vertical posi-

tion. The beam is 2.50 m long and

weighs 500 N.Atacertaininstantthe @
worker holds the beam momentarily
at rest with one end at distance d =
1.50 m above the floor, as shown in
Fig. 12-75, by exerting a force P on
the beam, perpendicular to the
beam. (a) What is the magnitude P?
(b) What is the magnitude of the (net) force of the floor on the
beam? (c) What is the minimum value the coefficient of static
friction between beam and floor can have in order for the beam
not to slip at this instant?

69 SSM In Fig. 12-76, a uniform rod of mass m is
hinged to a building at its lower end, while its upper
end is held in place by a rope attached to the wall. If
angle 6, = 60°, what value must angle @; have so
that the tension in the rope is equal to mg/2?

70 A 73kg man stands on a level bridge of
length L. He is at distance L/4 from one end. The
bridge is uniform and weighs 2.7 KN. What are the
magnitudes of the vertical forces on the bridge from
its supports at (a) the end farther from him and (b) the nearer end?

tal floor. The coefficient of static friction between cube and floor is
uA horizontal pull P is applied perpendicular to one of the verti-
cal faces of the cube, at a distance 7.0 cm above the floor on the
vertical midline of the cube face. The magnitude of P is gradually
increased. During that increase, for what values of «« will the cube
eventually (a) begin to slide and (b) begin to tip? (Hint: At the
onset of tipping, where is the normal force located?)

72. The system in Fig, 12-77 is in equilibrium. The angles are 6, = 60°
and 6 = 20°, and the ball has mass M = 2.0 kg. What is the tension

CHAPTER 12 EQUILIBRIUM AND ELASTICITY

73 ssM A uniform ladder is 10m
long and weighs 200N. In
Fig, 12-78, the ladder leans against
a vertical, frictionless wall at height
h=8.0m above the ground. A
horizontal force F is applied to the
ladder at distance d = 2.0m from
its base (measured along the lad-
der). (a) If force magnitude F = 50
N, what is the force of the ground
on the ladder, in unit-vector nota-
tion? (b) If F = 150 N, what is the
force of the ground on the ladder,
also in unit-vector notation? (c) Suppose the coefficient of static
friction between the ladder and the ground is 0.38; for what mini-
mum value of the force magnitude F will the base of the ladder
just barely start to move toward the wall?

74 A pan balance is made up of a rigid, massless rod with a hang-
ing pan attached at each end. The rod is supported at and free to
rotate about a point not at its center. It is balanced by unequal
masses placed in the two pans. When an unknown mass m is placed
in the left pan, it is balanced by a mass m placed in the right pan;
when the mass m is placed in the right pan, it is balanced by a mass
my in the left pan. Show that m = Vimym).

75 The rigid square frame in A GC 7
Fig. 12-79 consists of the four side bars
AB, BC, CD, and DA plus two diago-
nal bars AC and BD, which pass each
other freely at E. By means of the turn-
buckle G, bar AB is put under tension,
as if its ends were subject to horizontal,
outward forces T of magnitude 535 N.
(a) Which of the other bars are in ten-
sion? What are the magnitudes of (b)
the forces causing the tension in those bars and (c) the forces caus-
ing compression in the other bars? (Hint: Symmetry considera-
tions can lead to considerable simplification in this problem.)

76 A gymnast with mass 46.0kg 7 3
stands on the end of a uniform bal- ——}
ance beam as shown in Fig. 12-80. The L.
beam is 5.00 mlong and has a mass of
250 kg (excluding the mass of the two
supports). Each support is 0.540m
from its end of the beam. In unit-vec-
tor notation, what are the forces on
the beam due to (a) support 1 and
(b) support 2?

77 Figure 12-81 shows a 300 kg
cylinder that is horizontal. Three
steel wires support the cylinder
from a ceiling. Wires 1 and 3 are at-
tached at the ends of the cylinder,
and wire 2 is attached at the cen-
ter. The wires each have a cross-
sectional area of 2.00 X 10-° m’.
Initially (before the cylinder was put in place) wires 1 and 3
were 2.0000 m long and wire 2 was 6.00 mm longer than that.
Now (with the cylinder in place) all three wires have been
stretched. What is the tension in (a) wire 1 and (b) wire 2?
