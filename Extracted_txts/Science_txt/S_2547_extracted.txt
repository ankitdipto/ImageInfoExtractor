Sample Problem 13.01

Figure 13-4a shows an arrangement of three particles, parti-
cle 1 of mass m, = 6.0 kg and particles 2 and 3 of mass ny =
mz, = 4.0 kg, and distance a = 2.0 cm. What is the net gravi-
tational force Fact on particle 1 due to the other particles?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Because we have particles, the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force on particle 1 due to either of the other particles is
given by Eq. 13-1 (F= Gmymy/?). (2) The direction of either
gravitational force on particle 1 is toward the particle responsi-
ble for it. (3) Because the forces are not along a single axis, we
cannot simply add or subtract their magnitudes or their compo-
nents to get the net force. Instead, we must add them as vectors.

Calculations: From Eq. 13-1, the magnitude of the force Tam
on particle 1 from particle 2 is

particle 3 is

Net gravitational force, 2D, three particles

Force F'\7is directed in the positive direction of the y axis (Fig.
13-4b) and has only the y component Fp. Similarly, Fy is di-
rected in the negative direction of the x axis and has only the x
component —F); (Fig. 13-4c). (Note something important: We
draw the force diagrams with the tail of a force vector an-
chored on the particle experiencing the force. Drawing them
in other ways invites errors, especially on exams.)

To find the net force ao on particle 1, we must add
the two forces as vectors (Figs. 13-4d and e). We can do so on
a vector-capable calculator. However, here we note that
—F,3 and Fy are actually the x and y components of F ince
Therefore, we can use Eq. 3-6 to find first the magnitude and
then the direction of F gee The magnitude is

Fie = V (Fo)? + (Fa)
= V(4.00 x 10-° Ny? + ( x 10-°NP
=41x 10°N (Answer)

Relative to the positive direction of the x axis, Eq. 3-6 gives
the direction of er as

Fy 4.00 x 10°°N
—— = tan —— 16".

Fy" —1.00 x 10-°N

Is this a reasonable direction (Fig. 13-4)? No, because the
direction of ees must be between the directions of Fy and
F 3. Recall from Chapter 3 that a calculator displays only
one of the two possible answers to a tan”! function. We find
the other answer by adding 180°:

—76° + 180° = 104°,

6= tan?!

which is a reasonable direction for F\ net (Fig. 13-4g).

on the particle. In this limit, the sum of Eq. 13-5 becomes an integral and we have

A= [ar

in which the integral is taken over the entire extended object and we drop the
subscript “net.” If the extended object is a uniform sphere or a spherical shell, we
can avoid the integration of Eq. 13-6 by assuming that the object’s mass is
concentrated at the object’s center and using Eq. 13-1.
