(pulls) on particle 1,

not the forces on

(pull) on particle 1
due to particle 2.

Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to. . .

13.06 Distinguish between the free-fall acceleration and the
gravitational acceleration.

Key Ideas

13.07 Calculate the gravitational acceleration near but out-
side a uniform, spherical astronomical body.

13.08 Distinguish between measured weight and the magni-
tude of the gravitational force.

 

@ The gravitational acceleration a, of a particle (of mass m) is
due solely to the gravitational force acting on it. When the
particle is at distance r from the center of a uniform, spheri-
cal body of mass M, the magnitude F of the gravitational
force on the particle is given by Eq. 13-1. Thus, by Newton's
second law,

F=ma,,
which gives

GM

y=
@ Because Earth's mass is not distributed uniformly, because
the planet is not perfectly spherical, and because it rotates,
the actual free-fall acceleration g of a particle near Earth dif-
fers slightly from the gravitational acceleration @,, and the par-
ticle's weight (equal to mg) differs from the magnitude of the
gravitational force on it.
