Figure 13-6 (a) A crate sitting on a scale at Earth’s equator, as seen by an observer
positioned on Earth’s rotation axis at some point above the north pole. (b) A free-body
diagram for the crate, with a radial r axis extending from Earth’s center. The gravitational
force on the crate is represented with its equivalent md. The normal force on the crate
from the scale is Fy. Because of Earth’s rotation, the crate has a centripetal acceleration &
that is directed toward Earth’s center.

as Earth turns, the crate has a centripetal acceleration @ directed toward
Earth’s center. From Eq. 10-23 (a, = wr), we know this acceleration is equal to
wR, where w is Earth’s angular speed and R is the circle’s radius (approxi-
mately Earth’s radius). Thus, we can write Newton’s second law for forces
along the r axis (Fyet, = ma,) as

Fy — ma, = m(—@R). (13-12)

The magnitude Fy of the normal force is equal to the weight mg read on the scale.
With mg substituted for Fy, Eq. 13-12 gives us

mg = ma, — m(w°R), (13-13)

Thus, the measured weight is less than the magnitude of the gravitational force
on the crate, because of Earth’s rotation.
Acceleration Difference. To find a corresponding expression for g and a,, we

cancel m from Eq. 13-13 to write
g=a,— oR, (13-14)

Thus, the measured free-fall acceleration is less than the gravitational accelera-

Equator. The difference between accelerations g and a, is equal to wR and
is greatest on the equator (for one reason, the radius of the circle traveled by the
crate is greatest there). To find the difference, we can use Eq. 10-5 (w = A@/At)
and Earth’s radius R = 6.37 X 10° m. For one rotation of Earth, @ is 27 rad and
the time period Atis about 24 h. Using these values (and converting hours to sec-
onds), we find that g is less than a, by only about 0.034 m/s? (small compared to
9.8 m/s”). Therefore, neglecting the difference in accelerations g and a, is often
justified. Similarly, neglecting the difference between weight and the magnitude
of the gravitational force is also often justified.
