13-5 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY

This is Newton’s law of gravitation (Eq. 13-1). The minus sign indicates that the
force on mass m points radially inward, toward mass M.

Escape Speed

If you fire a projectile upward, usually it will slow, stop momentarily, and return
to Earth. There is, however, a certain minimum initial speed that will cause it to
move upward forever, theoretically coming to rest only at infinity. This minimum
initial speed is called the (Earth) escape speed.

Consider a projectile of mass m, leaving the surface of a planet (or some
other astronomical body or system) with escape speed v. The projectile has a
kinetic energy K given by mv and a potential energy U given by Eq. 13-21:

GMm
R”

in which M is the mass of the planet and R is its radius.

When the projectile reaches infinity, it stops and thus has no kinetic energy.
It also has no potential energy because an infinite separation between two bod-
ies is our zero-potential-energy configuration. Its total energy at infinity is
therefore zero. From the principle of conservation of energy, its total energy at
the planet’s surface must also have been zero, and so

U=-—

 

K+U =m? +(-

This yields v= (13-28)

Note that v does not depend on the direction in which a projectile is fired
from a planet. However, attaining that speed is easier if the projectile is fired in
the direction the launch site is moving as the planet rotates about its axis. For
example, rockets are launched eastward at Cape Canaveral to take advantage of
the Cape’s eastward speed of 1500 km/h due to Earth’s rotation.

Equation 13-28 can be applied to find the escape speed of a projectile from
any astronomical body, provided we substitute the mass of the body for M and
the radius of the body for R. Table 13-2 shows some escape speeds.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

You move a ball of mass m away from a sphere of mass M. (a) Does the gravitational
potential energy of the system of ball and sphere increase or decrease? (b) Is positive
work or negative work done by the gravitational force between the ball and the sphere?
