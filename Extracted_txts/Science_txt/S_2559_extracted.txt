a triangle with base r A@ and height r. Since the area of a triangle is one-half of the
base times the height, AA ~ 376. This expression for AA becomes more exact
as At (hence A@) approaches zero. The instantaneous rate at which area is being
swept out is then

in which is the angular speed of the line connecting Sun and planet, as the line
rotates around the Sun.

Figure 13-13b shows the linear momentum Pp of the planet, along with the radial
and perpendicular components of p. From Eq. 11-20 (L = rp,), the magnitude of
the angular momentum L of the planet about the Sun is given by the product of r
and p,, the component of p’ perpendicular to r. Here, for a planet of mass m,

L= 1p. = (r)(m,) = (mar)
= mre, (13-31)

where we have replaced v, with its equivalent wr (Eq. 10-18). Eliminating rw
between Eqs. 13-30 and 13-31 leads to

If dA/dt is constant, as Kepler said it is, then Eq. 13-32 means that L must also be
constant—angular momentum is conserved. Kepler’s second law is indeed
equivalent to the law of conservation of angular momentum.

o 3, THE LAW OF PERIODS: The square of the period of any planet is propor-
tional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.

To see this, consider the circular orbit of Fig. 13-14, with radius r (the radius of
a circle is equivalent to the semimajor axis of an ellipse). Applying Newton’s
second law (F = ma) to the orbiting planet in Fig. 13-14 yields

ae = (m)(w"r). (13-33)

 

Here we have substituted from Eg. 13-1 for the force magnitude F and used
Eq. 10-23 to substitute w*r for the centripetal acceleration. If we now use Eq. 10-20
to replace w with 27/T, where T is the period of the motion, we obtain Kepler’s
third law:

f= (4) 1? (lawof periods). (13-34)

The quantity in parentheses is a constant that depends only on the mass M of the
central body about which the planet orbits.

Equation 13-34 holds also for elliptical orbits, provided we replace r with
a, the semimajor axis of the ellipse. This law predicts that the ratio T?/a’ has es-
sentially the same value for every planetary orbit around a given massive
body. Table 13-3 shows how well it holds for the orbits of the planets of the
solar system.

Iv] Checkpoint 4

Satellite 1 is in a certain circular orbit around a planet, while satellite 2 is in a larger
circular orbit. Which satellite has (a) the longer period and (b) the greater speed?
