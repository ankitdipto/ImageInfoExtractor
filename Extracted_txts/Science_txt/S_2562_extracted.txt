Sample Problem 13.05 Mechanical energy of orbiting bowling ball

A playful astronaut releases a bowling ball, of mass m =
7.20 kg, into circular orbit about Earth at an altitude h of
350 km.

(a) What is the mechanical energy E of the ball in its orbit?

KEY IDEA

We can get E from the orbital energy, given by Eq. 13-40
(E = —GMm/2r), if we first find the orbital radius r. (It is
not simply the given altitude.)

Calculations: The orbital radius must be

r=R+h= 6370 km + 350 km = 6.72 X 10°m,
in which R is the radius of Earth. Then, from Eq. 13-40 with
Earth mass M = 5.98 x 10*4kg, the mechanical energy is

(Answer)

(b) What is the mechanical energy Ey of the ball on the
launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center (before launch)?
From there to the orbit, what is the change AE in the ball’s
mechanical energy?

KEY IDEA

 

On the launchpad, the ball is not in orbit and thus Eq. 13-40
does not apply. Instead, we must find Ey = Ko + Up, where
Ko is the ball’s kinetic energy and Up is the gravitational po-
tential energy of the ball—Earth system.

Calculations: To find Up, we use Eq. 13-21 to write

= —4.51 X 10°J = —451 ML.
The kinetic energy Ko of the ball is due to the ball’s motion
with Earth’s rotation. You can show that Ky is less than 1 MJ,
which is negligible relative to Up. Thus, the mechanical en-
ergy of the ball on the launchpad is
Ey = Ky + Up) ~ 0 — 451 MJ = —451 MI. (Answer)
The increase in the mechanical energy of the ball from
launchpad to orbit is
AE = E— Ey = (—214M5) — (—451 MJ)
= 237 MI. (Answer)
This is worth a few dollars at your utility company.

Obviously the high cost of placing objects into orbit is not
due to their required mechanical energy.

Sample Problem 13.06 Transforming a circular orbit into an elliptical orbit

A spaceship of mass m = 4.50 X 10? kgis ina circular Earth
orbit of radius r = 8.00 x 10° mand period Ty = 118.6 min =
7.119 X 10° s when a thruster is fired in the forward direction
to decrease the speed to 96.0% of the original speed. What is
the period T of the resulting elliptical orbit (Fig. 13-17)?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The orbit of an elliptical orbit is related to the semima-
jor axis a by Kepler’s third law, written as Eq. 13-34 (T? =
47°r/GM) but with a replacing r. (2) The semimajor axis a
is related to the total mechanical energy E of the ship by
Eq. 13-42 (E = —GMmi2a), in which Earth’s mass is M =
5.98 x 10% kg. (3) The potential energy of the ship at radius
r from Earth’s center is given by Eq. 13-21 (U = —GMmir).

Calculations: Looking over the Key Ideas, we see that we
need to calculate the total energy E to find the semimajor
axis a, so that we can then determine the period of the ellipti-
cal orbit. Let’s start with the kinetic energy, calculating it just
after the thruster is fired. The speed v just then is 96% of the
initial speed vp, which was equal to the ratio of the circumfer-

ence of the initial circular orbit to the initial period of the or-
bit. Thus, just after the thruster is fired, the kinetic energy is
