374 CHAPTER 13 GRAVITATION

Just after the thruster is fired, the ship is still at orbital
radius r, and thus its gravitational potential energy is
__GMm

ir
_ _ (6.67 X 10-" N-m*/kg?)(5.98 X 10% kg)(4.50 X 103kg)
~ 8.00 x 10°m

w=

= —2.2436 x 10" J.
‘We can now find the semimajor axis by rearranging Eq. 13-42,
substituting a for r, and then substituting in our energy results:

_GMm ___GMm
2E (K+ U)

_ (667 X 10°! N-m*/kg?)(5.98 X 10% kg)(4.50 X 10°kg)
~ 2(1.0338 X 10" J — 2.2436 x 10'4J)

= 7418 X 10°m.

 

13-8 EINSTEIN AND GRAVITATION

OK, one more step to go. We substitute a for r in Eq. 13-34
and then solve for the period T, substituting our result for a:

47a? yr
T=
Car
42°(7.418 X 10°m)?

n
= (a X 10-1 N- m/kg2)(5.98 X ae!
= 6.356 X 10°s = 106 min. (Answer)

This is the period of the elliptical orbit that the ship takes af-
ter the thruster is fired. It is less than the period Tp for the cir-
cular orbit for two reasons. (1) The orbital path length is now
less. (2) The elliptical path takes the ship closer to Earth
everywhere except at the point of firing (Fig. 13-17). The re-
sulting decrease in gravitational potential energy increases
the kinetic energy and thus also the speed of the ship.

13.24 Explain Einstein's principle of equivalence.

Key Idea

13.25 Identify Einstein's model for gravitation as being due to
the curvature of spacetime.

@ Einstein pointed out that gravitation and acceleration are equivalent. This principle of equivalence led him to a theory of gravi-
tation (the general theory of relativity) that explains gravitational effects in terms of a curvature of space.

 

Einstein and Gravitation

Principle of Equivalence

Albert Einstein once said: “I was ... in the patent office at Bern when all of a
sudden a thought occurred to me: ‘If a person falls freely, he will not feel his
own weight.’ I was startled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me.
It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.”

Thus Einstein tells us how he began to form his general theory of relativity.
The fundamental postulate of this theory about gravitation (the gravitating of
objects toward each other) is called the principle of equivalence, which says that
gravitation and acceleration are equivalent. If a physicist were locked up in a
small box as in Fig. 13-18, he would not be able to tell whether the box was at

Figure 13-18 (a) A physicist in a box rest-
ing on Earth sees a cantaloupe falling
with acceleration a = 9.8 m/s”. (b) If he
and the box accelerate in deep space at
9.8 m/s’, the cantaloupe has the same
acceleration relative to him. It is not
possible, by doing experiments within
the box, for the physicist to tell which
situation he is in. For example, the plat-
form scale on which he stands reads
the same weight in both situations. (a)
