Moon. What is the ratio Fo,,/Feart, Of these two forces? (The aver-

of the universe, tiny black holes might still wander through the
universe. If one with a mass of 1 X10! kg (and a radius of only
1X 10°! m) reached Earth, at what distance from your head
would its gravitational pull on you match that of Earth’s?

particle C, of mass 75.0m,, is to be placed

hollow inside a lead sphere of radius
R = 4.00 cm; the surface of the hol-
low passes through the center of the
sphere and “touches” the right
side of the sphere. The mass of the
sphere before hollowing was M =
2.95 kg. With what gravitational
force does the hollowed-out lead sphere attract a small sphere
of mass m = 0.431 kg that lies at a distance d = 9.00 cm from
the center of the lead sphere, on the straight line connecting the
centers of the spheres and of the hollow?
