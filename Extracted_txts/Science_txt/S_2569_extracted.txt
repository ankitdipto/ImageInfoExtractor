380 CHAPTER 13 GRAVITATION

Particle B, at xyz coordinates (2.00d, 1.00d, 2.004), has mass 2.00m,,
and particle C, at coordinates (—1.00d, 2.00d, —3.00d), has mass
3.00m,. A fourth particle D, with mass 4.00m,, is to be placed near
the other particles. In terms of distance d, at what (a) x,(b) y,and (c) z
coordinate should D be placed so that the net gravitational force on
A from B, C,and D is zero?

16 @ In Fig. 13-40, a particle
of mass m, = 0.67 kg is a dis- 7%
tance d = 23 cm from one end of
a uniform rod with length L =
3.0 mand mass M = 5.0 kg. What
is the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force Fon the particle from the rod?

Module 13-3 Gravitation Near Earth’s Surface

17 (a) What will an object weigh on the Moon's surface if it
weighs 100 N on Earth’s surface? (b) How many Earth radii must
this same object be from the center of Earth if it is to weigh the
same as it does on the Moon?

°18 <= Mountain pull. A large mountain can slightly affect the
direction of “down” as determined by a plumb line. Assume that
we can model a mountain as a sphere of radius R = 2.00 km and
density (mass per unit volume) 2.6 x 10° kg/m*. Assume also that
we hang a 0.50 m plumb line at a distance of 3R from the sphere’s
center and such that the sphere pulls horizontally on the lower
end. How far would the lower end move toward the sphere?

*19 SSM At what altitude above Earth’s surface would the
gravitational acceleration be 4.9 m/s”?

*20 Mile-high building. In 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright proposed
the construction of a mile-high building in Chicago. Suppose the
building had been constructed. Ignoring Earth’s rotation, find
the change in your weight if you were to ride an elevator from the
street level, where you weigh 600 N, to the top of the building.

°°21 \LW Certain neutron stars (extremely dense stars) are
believed to be rotating at about 1 rev/s. If such a star has a radius of
20 km, what must be its minimum mass so that material on its sur-
face remains in place during the rapid rotation?

°°22 The radius R;, and mass M,, of a black hole are related by
R, = 2GM,/c?, where c is the speed of light. Assume that the gravi-
tational acceleration a, of an object at a distance r, = 1.001, from
the center of a black hole is given by Eq. 13-11 (it is, for large black
holes). (a) In terms of M,, find a, atr,.(b) Doesa, at r, increase or de-
crease as M,, increases? (c) What is a, at r, for a very large black hole
whose mass is 1.55 X 10" times the solar mass of 1.99 x 10" kg?
(d) If an astronaut of height 1.70 mis at r, with her feet down, what is
the difference in gravitational acceleration between her head and
feet? (e) Is the tendency to stretch the astronaut severe?

23 One model for a certain planet has a core of radius R and mass
M surrounded by an outer shell of inner radius R, outer radius 2R,
and mass 4M. If M=4.1 x 10*kg and

R = 6.0 X 10° m, what is the gravitational

acceleration of a particle at points (a) R g
and (b) 3R from the center of the planet?

shells, when the particle is located at radial distance (a) a, (b) b,
and (c) c.

25 A solid sphere has a uniformly distributed mass of 1.0 x 10*
kg and a radius of 1.0 m. What is the magnitude of the gravitational
force due to the sphere on a particle of mass m when the particle is
located at a distance of (a) 1.5 m and (b) 0.50 m from the center of
the sphere? (c) Write a general expression for the magnitude
of the gravitational force on the particle at a distance r= 1.0m
from the center of the sphere.

“26 A uniform solid sphere of radius R produces a gravitational
acceleration of a, on its surface. At what distance from the sphere’s
center are there points (a) inside and (b) outside the sphere where
the gravitational acceleration is a,/3?

*°27 Figure 13-42 shows, not to scale, a cross section through
the interior of Earth. Rather than being uniform throughout,
Earth is divided into three zones: an outer crust, a mantle, and an
inner core. The dimensions of these zones and the masses con-
tained within them are shown on the figure. Earth has a total
mass of 5.98 X 10™ kg and a radius of 6370 km. Ignore rotation
and assume that Earth is spherical. (a) Calculate a, at the sur-
face. (b) Suppose that a bore hole (the Mohole) is driven to the
crust—mantle interface at a depth of 25.0 km; what would be the
value of a, at the bottom of the hole? (c) Suppose that Earth
were a uniform sphere with the same total mass and size. What
would be the value of a, at a depth of 25.0 km? (Precise mea-
surements of a, are sensitive probes of the interior structure of
Earth, although results can be clouded by local variations in
mass distribution.)

28 @ Assume a planet is a uniform sphere of radius R that
(somehow) has a narrow radial tunnel through its center
(Fig. 13-7). Also assume we can position an apple anywhere
along the tunnel or outside the sphere. Let Fr be the magnitude
of the gravitational force on the apple when it is located at
the planet’s surface. How far
from the surface is there a point
where the magnitude is }F, if
we move the apple (a) away
from the planet and (b) into
the tunnel?
