a circular orbit at an altitude of 160 km above Earth’s surface?

°44 A satellite is put in a circular orbit about Earth with a radius
equal to one-half the radius of the Moon’s orbit. What is its period
of revolution in lunar months? (A lunar month is the period of rev-
olution of the Moon.)

cular orbit of radius 9.4 X 10°m with a period of 7h 39 min.

°46 The first known collision between space debris and a func-
tioning satellite occurred in 1996: At an altitude of 700 km, a year-
old French spy satellite was hit by a piece of an Ariane rocket. A
stabilizing boom on the satellite was demolished, and the satellite
