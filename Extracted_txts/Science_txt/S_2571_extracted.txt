was sent spinning out of control. Just before the collision and in
kilometers per hour, what was the speed of the rocket piece rela-
tive to the satellite if both were in circular orbits and the collision
was (a) head-on and (b) along perpendicular paths?

°47 SSM WWW The Sun, which is 2.2 x 10° m from the center
of the Milky Way galaxy, revolves around that center once every
2.5 X 108 years. Assuming each star in the Galaxy has a mass equal
to the Sun’s mass of 2.0 x 10° kg, the stars are distributed uni-
formly in a sphere about the galactic center, and the Sun is at the
edge of that sphere, estimate the number of stars in the Galaxy.

°48 The mean distance of Mars from the Sun is 1.52 times that of
Earth from the Sun. From Kepler's law of periods, calculate the
number of years required for Mars to make one revolution around
the Sun; compare your answer with the value given in Appendix C.

°49 A comet that was seen in April 574 by Chinese astronomers
on a day known by them as the Woo Woo day was spotted again in
May 1994. Assume the time between observations is the period of
the Woo Woo day comet and its eccentricity is 0.9932. What are (a)
the semimajor axis of the comet's orbit and (b) its greatest distance
from the Sun in terms of the mean orbital radius Rp of Pluto?

°50 <= An orbiting satellite stays over a certain spot on the
equator of (rotating) Earth. What is the altitude of the orbit (called
a geosynchronous orbit)?

°51 SSM A satellite, moving in an elliptical orbit, is 360 km above
Earth’s surface at its farthest point and 180 km above at its closest point.
Calculate (a) the semimajor axis and (b) the eccentricity of the orbit.

°52 The Sun’s center is at one focus of Earth’s orbit. How far
from this focus is the other focus, (a) in meters and (b) in terms of
the solar radius, 6.96 X 10°m? The eccentricity is 0.0167, and the
semimajor axis is 1.50 X 10" m.

°°53 A 20kg satellite has a circular orbit with a period of 2.4 h
and a radius of 8.0 X 10°m around a planet of unknown mass. If
the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration on the surface of
the planet is 8.0 m/s”, what is the radius of the planet?

54 @ Hunting a black hole.
Observations of the light from a
certain star indicate that it is part of
a binary (two-star) system. This visi-
ble star has orbital speed v = 270
kmi&s, orbital period T = 1.70 days,
and approximate mass m, = 6M,,
where M, is the Sun’s mass, 1.99 X
10° kg. Assume that the visible star
and its companion star, which is
dark and unseen, are both in circu- a -
lar orbits (Fig. 13-47). What integer til
multiple of M, gives the approxi-

mate mass my of the dark star?

*°55 In 1610, Galileo used his telescope to discover four moons
around Jupiter, with these mean orbital radii a and periods T:

Name a (108 m) T (days)
Io 422 177
Europa 671 3.55
Ganymede 10.7 7.16
Callisto 188 16.7

 

(a) Plot log a (y axis) against log T (x axis) and show that you get a
straight line. (b) Measure the slope of the line and compare it with
the value that you expect from Kepler’s third law. (c) Find the mass
of Jupiter from the intercept of this line with the y axis.

56 In 1993 the spacecraft Galileo sent an image (Fig. 13-48) of
asteroid 243 Ida and a tiny orbiting moon (now known as Dactyl), the
first confirmed example of an asteroid—moon system. In the image,
the moon, which is 1.5 km wide, is 100 km from the center of the as-
teroid, which is 55 km long, Assume the moon’s orbit is circular witha
period of 27 h. (a) What is the mass of the asteroid? (b) The volume
of the asteroid, measured from the Galileo images, is 14 100 km’.
What is the density (mass per unit volume) of the asteroid?

°°57 ILW In a certain binary-star system, each star has the same
mass as our Sun, and they revolve about their center of mass. The
distance between them is the same as the distance between Earth
and the Sun. What is their period of revolution in years?

58 © The presence of an unseen planet orbiting a distant star
can sometimes be inferred from the motion of the star as we see
it. As the star and planet orbit the center of mass of the
star—planet system, the star moves toward and away from us with
what is called the /ine of sight velocity, a motion that can be de-
tected. Figure 13-49 shows a graph of the line of sight velocity ver-
sus time for the star 14 Herculis. The star’s mass is believed to be
0.90 of the mass of our Sun. Assume that only one planet orbits the
star and that our view is along the plane of the orbit. Then approxi-
mate (a) the planet’s mass in terms of Jupiter’s mass m, and (b) the
planet's orbital radius in terms of Earth’s orbital radius r;.

59 Three identical stars of mass M form an equilateral triangle
that rotates around the triangle’s center as the stars move in a com-
mon circle about that center. The triangle has edge length L. What
is the speed of the stars?
