moving if it fell from rest through a distance of 1.0 m on such a star?
(Assume the star does not rotate.)

73 Figure 13-53 is a graph of the kinetic energy K of an asteroid
versus its distance r from Earth’s center, as the asteroid falls di-
rectly in toward that center. (a) What is the (approximate) mass of
the asteroid? (b) What is its speed at r = 1.945 x 107 m?

74 <%= The mysterious visitor that appears in the enchanting
story The Little Prince was said to come from a planet that “was
scarcely any larger than a house!” Assume that the mass per unit
volume of the planet is about that of Earth and that the planet does
not appreciably spin. Approximate (a) the free-fall acceleration on
the planet’s surface and (b) the escape speed from the planet.

75 tw The masses and coordinates of three spheres are as
follows: 20 kg, x = 0.50m, y = 1.0m; 40 kg, x = —1.0m,y = —1.0 m;
60 kg, x = 0 m, y = —0.50 m. What is the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force on a 20 kg sphere located at the origin due to these
three spheres?

76 ssM A very early, simple satellite consisted of an inflated
spherical aluminum balloon 30m in diameter and of mass
20 kg. Suppose a meteor having a mass of 7.0 kg passes within 3.0
m of the surface of the satellite. What is the magnitude of the gravi-
tational force on the meteor from the satellite at the closest ap-
proach?

77 ® Four uniform spheres, with masses m4 = 40 kg, mp = 35 kg,
mc = 200 kg, and mp = 50 kg, have (x, y) coordinates of (0,50 cm),
(0,0), (80 cm, 0), and (40 cm, 0), respectively. In unit-vector nota-
tion, what is the net gravitational force on sphere B due to the
other spheres?

78 (a) In Problem 77, remove sphere A and calculate the gravi-
tational potential energy of the remaining three-particle system.
(b) If A is then put back in place, is the potential energy of the
four-particle system more or less than that of the system in (a)?
(c) In (a), is the work done by you to remove A positive or nega-

tive? (d) In (b), is the work done by Lot dts

(Fig. 13-54). The two orbiting stars are al- = “

period of revolution of the stars. Problem 79.

80 The fastest possible rate of rotation of a planet is that for which the
gravitational force on material at the equator just barely provides the
centripetal force needed for the rotation. (Why?) (a) Show that the
corresponding shortest period of rotation is

Vee

where p is the uniform density (mass per unit volume) of the
spherical planet. (b) Calculate the rotation period assuming a
density of 3.0 g/cm’, typical of many planets, satellites, and
asteroids. No astronomical object has ever been found to be
spinning with a period shorter than that determined by this
analysis.

   

81 SSM Ina double-star system, two stars of mass 3.0 X 10 kg
each rotate about the system’s center of mass at radius 1.0 X 10"! m.
(a) What is their common angular speed? (b) If a meteoroid
passes through the system’s center of mass perpendicular to
their orbital plane, what minimum speed must it have at the
center of mass if it is to escape to “infinity” from the two-star
system?

82 A satellite is in elliptical orbit with a period of 8.00 x 10* s
about a planet of mass 7.00 X 10% kg. At aphelion, at radius 4.5
10’ m, the satellite’s angular speed is 7.158 X 10-5 rad/s. What is its
angular speed at perihelion?

83 ssM Ina shuttle craft of mass m = 3000 kg, Captain Janeway
orbits a planet of mass M = 9.50 X 10% kg, in a circular orbit of ra-
dius r = 4.20 x 107 m. What are (a) the period of the orbit and (b)
the speed of the shuttle craft? Janeway briefly fires a forward-
pointing thruster, reducing her speed by 2.00%. Just then, what are
(c) the speed, (d) the kinetic energy, (e) the gravitational potential
energy, and (f) the mechanical energy of the shuttle craft? (g)
What is the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit now taken by the
craft? (h) What is the difference between the period of the original
circular orbit and that of the new elliptical orbit? (i) Which orbit
has the smaller period?

84 Consider a pulsar, a collapsed star of extremely high density,
with a mass M equal to that of the Sun (1.98 x 10° kg), a radius R
of only 12 km, and a rotational period T of 0.041 s. By what per-
centage does the free-fall acceleration g differ from the gravita-
tional acceleration a, at the equator of this spherical star?

85 iLw A projectile is fired vertically from Earth’s surface with an
initial speed of 10 km/s. Neglecting air drag, how far above the sur-
face of Earth will it go?

86 An object lying on Earth’s equator is accelerated (a) toward the
center of Earth because Earth rotates, (b) toward the Sun because
Earth revolves around the Sun in an almost circular orbit, and
(c) toward the center of our galaxy because the Sun moves around
the galactic center. For the latter, the period is 2.5 x 10° y and the
radius is 2.2 x 10°” m. Calculate these three accelerations as multi-
ples of g = 9.8 m/s’.

87 (a) If the legendary apple of Newton could be released from
rest at a height of 2m from the surface of a neutron star with a
mass 1.5 times that of our Sun and a radius of 20 km, what would be
the apple’s speed when it reached the surface of the star? (b) If the
apple could rest on the surface of the star, what would be the approxi-
mate difference between the gravitational acceleration at the top and
at the bottom of the apple? (Choose a reasonable size for an apple;
the answer indicates that an apple would never survive near a neu-
tron star.)
