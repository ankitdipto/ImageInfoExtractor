the area), we can write Eq. 14-3 as

p= = (pressure of uniform force on flat area), (14-4)
where Fis the magnitude of the normal force on area A.

We find by experiment that at a given point in a fluid at rest, the pressure p
defined by Eq. 14-4 has the same value no matter how the pressure sensor is
oriented. Pressure is a scalar, having no directional properties. It is true that
the force acting on the piston of our pressure sensor is a vector quantity, but
Eg. 14-4 involves only the magnitude of that force, a scalar quantity.

The SI unit of pressure is the newton per square meter, which is given a spe-
cial name, the pascal (Pa). In metric countries, tire pressure gauges are calibrated
in kilopascals. The pascal is related to some other common (non-SI) pressure
units as follows:

1atm = 1.01 x 10° Pa = 760 torr = 14.7 Ib/in2.

The atmosphere (atm) is, as the name suggests, the approximate average pressure
of the atmosphere at sea level. The torr (named for Evangelista Torricelli, who
invented the mercury barometer in 1674) was formerly called the millimeter of
mercury (mm Hg). The pound per square inch is often abbreviated psi. Table 14-2

shows some pressures.

Sample Problem 14.01 Atmospheric pressure and force

A living room has floor dimensions of 3.5 m and 4.2 manda
height of 2.4 m.

(a) What does the air in the room weigh when the air pres-
sure is 1.0 atm?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The air’s weight is equal to mg, where m is its mass.
(2) Mass m is related to the air density p and the air volume
V by Eq. 14-2 (p = mV).

Calculation: Putting the two ideas together and taking the
density of air at 1.0 atm from Table 14-1, we find

mg = (pV)g
= (1.21 kg/m3)(3.5 m X 4.2 m X 2.4m)(9.8 m/s?)
= 418N ~ 420N. (Answer)

This is the weight of about 110 cans of Pepsi.

(b) What is the magnitude of the atmosphere’s downward
force on the top of your head, which we take to have an area
of 0.040 m??

KEY IDEA

 

When the fluid pressure p ona surface of area A is uniform,
the fluid force on the surface can be obtained from Eq. 14-4
(p=FIA).

Calculation: Although air pressure varies daily, we can
approximate that p = 1.0 atm. Then Eq. 14-4 gives

1.01 x 105 N/m?

F=pA= (1.0 aimy( aan

= 40x 10°N. (Answer)

This large force is equal to the weight of the air column from
the top of your head to the top of the atmosphere.
