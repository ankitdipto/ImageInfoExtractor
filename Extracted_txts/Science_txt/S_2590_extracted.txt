14-7 BERNOULLI’S EQUATION 401

Sample Problem 14.05 A water stream narrows as it falls

Figure 14-18 shows how the stream of water emerging from a
faucet “necks down” as it falls. This change in the horizontal
cross-sectional area is characteristic of any laminar (non-
turbulant) falling stream because the gravitational force
increases the speed of the stream. Here the indicated cross-
sectional areas are Ag = 1.2 cm? and A = 0.35 cm’. The two
levels are separated by a vertical distance h = 45 mm. What
is the volume flow rate from the tap?

Figure 4-18 As water falls from a tap, its speed in-
creases. Because the volume flow rate must be the
same at all horizontal cross sections of the stream,
the stream must “neck down” (narrow).

KEY IDEA

 

The volume flow rate through the higher cross section must
be the same as that through the lower cross section.

Calculations: From Eq. 14-24, we have
Apyy = Av, (14-26)

where vp and v are the water speeds at the levels correspon-
ding to Ap and A. From Eq. 2-16 we can also write, because

the water is falling freely with acceleration g,
v? = vi + 2gh. (14-27)

Eliminating v between Eqs. 14-26 and 14-27 and solving for
Vo, we obtain

 

= 0.286 m/s = 28.6 cm/s.

From Eq. 14-24, the volume flow rate Ry is then
Ry = Aovo = (1.2 cm?)(28.6 cm/s)

= 34 cm/s. (Answer)

Key Idea

@ Applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to the flow of an ideal fluid leads to Bernoulli's equation:

p + 3pv? + pgy = aconstant

along any tube of flow.

Bernoulli's Equation

Figure 14-19 represents a tube through which an ideal fluid is flowing at a steady
rate. In a time interval At, suppose that a volume of fluid AV, colored purple in
Fig. 14-19, enters the tube at the left (or input) end and an identical volume,
