14-7 BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

First, we apply energy conservation in the form of the work—kinetic energy
theorem,
W = AK, (14-31)

which tells us that the change in the kinetic energy of our system must equal the
net work done on the system. The change in kinetic energy results from the
change in speed between the ends of the tube and is

AK = $Am v3 — 3Am v}
= 5p AV(v3 — v3), (14-32)
in which Am (= p AV) is the mass of the fluid that enters at the input end and
leaves at the output end during a small time interval At.
The work done on the system arises from two sources. The work W, done by

the gravitational force (Am g) on the fluid of mass Am during the vertical lift of
the mass from the input level to the output level is

W, = —Am g(y2 ~ yi)
= ~pgAV(y2 ~ yi): (14-33)
This work is negative because the upward displacement and the downward gravi-
tational force have opposite directions.

Work must also be done on the system (at the input end) to push the entering
fluid into the tube and by the system (at the output end) to push forward the fluid
that is located ahead of the emerging fluid. In general, the work done by a force
of magnitude F, acting on a fluid sample contained in a tube of area A to move
the fluid through a distance Av, is

F Ax = (pA)(Ax) = p(A Ax) = p AV.

The work done on the system is then p; AV, and the work done by the system
is —p) AV. Their sum W, is

W, = —p2AV + pi AV

= ~(P2~ pi)AV. (14-34)

The work—kinetic energy theorem of Eq. 14-31 now becomes

W=W, + W, =AK.
Substituting from Eqs. 14-32, 14-33, and 14-34 yields

~ pg AV(y2 = yr) ~ AV(p2 ~ pr) = 30 AV(¥3 ~ v4).

This, after a slight rearrangement, matches Eq. 14-28, which we set out to prove.
