poured slowly from a teapot spout
can double back under the spout for
a considerable distance (held there
by atmospheric pressure) before
detaching and falling. In Fig. 14-23,
the four points are at the top or bot-
tom of the water layers, inside or
outside. Rank those four points ac-
cording to the gauge pressure in the water there, most positive first.

water flows smoothly toward the right. The radii of the pipe sec-
tions are indicated. In which arrangements is the net work done on
a unit volume of water moving from the leftmost section to the
rightmost section (a) zero, (b) positive, and (c) negative?

8 A rectangular block is pushed
face-down into three liquids, in
turn. The apparent weight W,,,, of
the block versus depth A in the
three liquids is plotted in Fig. 14-26.
Rank the liquids according to their
weight per unit volume, greatest
first.

10 We have three containers with different liquids. The gauge
pressure p, versus depth / is plotted in Fig. 14-28 for the liquids.
In each container, we will fully submerge a rigid plastic bead.
Rank the plots according to the magnitude of the buoyant force
on the bead, greatest first.

Module 14-1 Fluids, Density, and Pressure

#7 WW A fish maintains its depth in fresh water by adjusting the
air content of porous bone or air sacs to make its average density
the same as that of the water. Suppose that with its air sacs col-
lapsed, a fish has a density of 1.08 g/cm}. To what fraction of its ex-
panded body volume must the fish inflate the air sacs to reduce its
density to that of water?

°2 A partially evacuated airtight container has a tight-fitting lid
of surface area 77 m? and negligible mass. If the force required to
remove the lid is 480 N and the atmospheric pressure is 1.0 X 10°
Pa, what is the internal air pressure?

°3 ssM Find the pressure increase in the fluid in a syringe when a
nurse applies a force of 42 N to the syringe’s circular piston, which
has a radius of 1.1 cm.

°4 Three liquids that will not mix are poured into a cylindrical con-
tainer. The volumes and densities of the liquids are 0.50 L, 2.6 g/cm’;
0.25 L, 1.0 g/em*; and 0.40 L, 0.80 g/cm’. What is the force on the
bottom of the container due to these liquids? One liter = 1 L =
1000 cm’. (Ignore the contribution due to the atmosphere.)

*5 ssmM An office window has dimensions 3.4 m by 2.1 m. As a
result of the passage of a storm, the outside air pressure drops to
0.96 atm, but inside the pressure is held at 1.0 atm. What net force
pushes out on the window?

#6 You inflate the front tires on your car to 28 psi. Later, you measure
your blood pressure, obtaining a reading of 120/80, the readings being
in mm Hg. In metric countries (whichis to say,most of the world), these
pressures are customarily reported in kilopascals (kPa). In kilopascals,
what are (a) your tire pressure and (b) your blood pressure?
