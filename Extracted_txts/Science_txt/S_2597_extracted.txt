°°20 The L-shaped fish tank shown in
Fig, 14-33 is filled with water and is open at
the top. If d= 5.0 m, what is the (total)
force exerted by the water (a) on face A
and (b) on face B?

sels with their bases at the same level each

9°22 ME g-LOC in dogfights. When a pilot takes a tight turn at high
speed in a modem fighter airplane, the blood pressure at the brain
level decreases, blood no longer perfuses the brain, and the blood in
the brain drains. If the heart maintains the (hydrostatic) gauge pressure
in the aorta at 120 torr (or mm Hg) when the pilot undergoes a hori-
zontal centripetal acceleration of 4g, what is the blood pressure (in
torr) at the brain, 30 cm radially inward from the heart? The perfusion
in the brain is small enough that the vision switches to black and white
and narrows to “tunnel vision” and the pilot can undergo g-LOC (“g-
induced loss of consciousness”). Blood density is 1.06 X 10° kg/m’.

23 @ In analyzing certain geo-
logical features, it is often appro-
priate to assume that the pressure
at some horizontal level of com-
pensation, deep inside Earth, is the
same over a large region and is
equal to the pressure due to the
gravitational force on the overly-
ing material. Thus, the pressure on
the level of compensation is given
by the fluid pressure formula. This
model requires, for one thing, that
mountains have roots of continen-
tal rock extending into the denser
mantle (Fig. 14-34). Consider a mountain of height H = 6.0 km
on a continent of thickness T = 32 km. The continental rock has
a density of 2.9 g/cm’, and beneath this rock the mantle has a
density of 3.3 g/cm*. Calculate the depth D of the root. (Hint: Set
the pressure at points a and b equal; the depth y of the level of
compensation will cancel out.)

about a horizontal line through O

parallel to the (long) width of the dam. This torque tends to rotate the
dam around that line, which would cause the dam to fail. (c) Find the

Module 14-3 Measuring Pressure

°25 In one observation, the column in a mercury barometer (as is
shown in Fig, 14-5a) has a measured height h of 740.35 mm. The tem-
perature is —5.0°C, at which temperature the density of mercury p is
1.3608 X 10*kg/m*. The free-fall acceleration g at the site of the barom-

 

eter is 9.7835 m/s*. What is the atmospheric pressure at that site in pas-
cals and in torr (which is the common unit for barometer readings)?

°26 To suck lemonade of density 1000 kg/m‘ up a straw to a maxi-
mum height of 4.0cm, what minimum gauge pressure (in atmo-
spheres) must you produce in your lungs?

27 ssM What would be the height of the atmosphere if the
air density (a) were uniform and (b) decreased linearly to zero
with height? Assume that at sea level the air pressure is 1.0 atm
and the air density is 1.3 kg/m’.

Module 14-4 Pascal’s Principle
°28 A piston of cross-sectional
area a is used in a hydraulic press to
exert a small force of magnitude f on
the enclosed liquid. A connecting 7
pipe leads to a larger piston of cross-
sectional area A (Fig. 14-36). (a) What
force magnitude F will the larger pis-
ton sustain without moving? (b) If
the piston diameters are 3.80 cm and
53.0 cm, what force magnitude on the small piston will balance a 20.0
KN force on the large piston?

29 In Fig. 14-37, a spring of spring Beam
constant 3.00 X 104N/m is between a Container ie
rigid beam and the output piston of a Spring. =
hydraulic lever. An empty container :
with negligible mass sits on the input
piston. The input piston has area A;,and
the output piston has area 18.0A,.
Initially the spring is at its rest length.
How many kilograms of sand must be
(slowly) poured into the container to compress the spring by 5.00 cm?

Module 14-5 Archimedes’ Principle

+30 A 5.00 kg object is released from rest while fully submerged
in a liquid. The liquid displaced by the submerged object has a
mass of 3.00 kg. How far and in what direction does the object
move in 0.200 s, assuming that it moves freely and that the drag
force on it from the liquid is negligible?

volume V submerged and in oil with 0.90V submerged. Find the den-
sity of (a) the wood and (b) the oil.

length L = 0.600 m and mass 450 kg

tank of liquid of density 1030 kg/m’.
Find (a) the magnitude of the total
downward force on the top of the
cube from the liquid and the atmo-
sphere, assuming atmospheric pres-
sure is 1.00 atm, (b) the magnitude
of the total upward force on the bot-
tom of the cube, and (c) the tension
in the rope. (d) Calculate the magnitude of the buoyant force on
the cube using Archimedes’ principle. What relation exists among
all these quantities?
