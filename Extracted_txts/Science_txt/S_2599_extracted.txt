Module 14-6 The Equation of Continuity
°49 <M Canal effect. Figure 14-45
shows an anchored barge that ex-
tends across a canal by distance
d = 30m and into the water by dis-
tance b =12m. The canal has a
width D=55m, a water depth
H = 14m, and a uniform water-flow
speed v, = 1.5 m/s. Assume that the
flow around the barge is uniform. As
the water passes the bow, the water
level undergoes a dramatic dip
known as the canal effect. If the dip
has depth A = 0.80 m, what is the water speed alongside the boat
through the vertical cross sections at (a) point a and (b) point b?
The erosion due to the speed increase is a common concern to hy-
draulic engineers.

50 Figure 14-46 shows two ? cos
sections of an old pipe system wu LL

that runs through a hill, with dy dy
distances d, = dy = 30m and D

D=110m. On each side of
the hill, the pipe radius is
2.00 cm. However, the radius of the pipe inside the hill is no longer
known. To determine it, hydraulic engineers first establish that water
flows through the left and right sections at 2.50 m/s. Then they re-
lease a dye in the water at point A and find that it takes 88.8s to
reach point B. What is the average radius of the pipe within the hill?

°51 SSM A garden hose with an internal diameter of 1.9 cm is
connected to a (stationary) lawn sprinkler that consists merely of
a container with 24 holes, each 0.13 cm in diameter. If the water
in the hose has a speed of 0.91 m/s, at what speed does it leave the
sprinkler holes?

°52 Two streams merge to form a river. One stream has a width
of 8.2 m, depth of 3.4 m, and current speed of 2.3 m/s. The other
stream is 6.8 m wide and 3.2 m deep, and flows at 2.6 mis. If the
river has width 10.5 m and speed 2.9 m/s, what is its depth?

°°53 SSM Water is pumped steadily out of a flooded basement at
5.0 m/s through a hose of radius 1.0 cm, passing through a window
3.0 m above the waterline. What is the pump’s power?

54 © The water flowing through a 1.9 cm (inside diameter) pipe
flows out through three 1.3 cm pipes. (a) If the flow rates in the
three smaller pipes are 26, 19, and 11 L/min, what is the flow rate in
the 1.9 cm pipe? (b) What is the ratio of the speed in the 1.9 cm pipe
to that in the pipe carrying 26 L/min?

55 How much work is done by pressure in forcing 1.4m} of
water through a pipe having an internal diameter of 13 mm if the
difference in pressure at the two ends of the pipe is 1.0 atm?

°56 Suppose that two tanks, 1 and 2, each with a large opening at
the top,contain different liquids. A small hole is made in the side of
each tank at the same depth / below the liquid surface, but the
hole in tank 1 has half the cross-sectional area of the hole in tank 2.
(a) What is the ratio p;/p) of the densities of the liquids if the mass
flow rate is the same for the two holes? (b) What is the ratio
Ry;/Ry2 of the volume flow rates from the two tanks? (c) At one in-
stant, the liquid in tank 1 is 12.0 cm above the hole. If the tanks are
to have equal volume flow rates, what height above the hole must
the liquid in tank 2 be just then?

 

°57 ssM A cylindrical tank with a large diameter is filled
with water to a depth D = 0.30 m. A hole of cross-sectional area
A = 65cm? in the bottom of the tank allows water to drain out. (a)
What is the drainage rate in cubic meters per second? (b) At what
distance below the bottom of the tank is the cross-sectional area of
the stream equal to one-half the area of the hole?

58 The intake in Fig. 14-47 has
cross-sectional area of 0.74 m? and
water flow at 0.40 m/s. At the outlet,
distance D = 180m below the in-
take, the cross-sectional area is
smaller than at the intake and the
water flows out at 9.5 m/s into
equipment. What is the pressure dif-
ference between inlet and outlet?

*59 SSM Water is moving with a speed of 5.0 m/s through a pipe
with a cross-sectional area of 4.0 cm?. The water gradually descends
10 mas the pipe cross-sectional area increases to 8.0 cm”. (a) What
is the speed at the lower level? (b) If the pressure at the upper level
is 1.5 X 105 Pa, what is the pressure at the lower level?

°60 Models of torpedoes are sometimes tested in a horizontal pipe of
flowing water, much as a wind tunnel is used to test model airplanes.
Consider a circular pipe of internal diameter 25.0 cm and a torpedo
model aligned along the long axis of the pipe. The model has a 5.00. cm
diameter and is to be tested with water flowing past it at 2.50 m/s. (a)
With what speed must the water flow in the part of the pipe that is
unconstricted by the model? (b) What will the pressure difference be
between the constricted and unconstricted parts of the pipe?

*61 ILW A water pipe having a 2.5 cm inside diameter carries wa-
ter into the basement of a house at a speed of 0.90 m/s and a pres-
sure of 170 kPa. If the pipe tapers to 1.2 cm and rises to the second
floor 7.6m above the input point, what are the (a) speed and
(b) water pressure at the second floor?

62 A pitot tube (Fig. 14-48) is used to determine the air-
speed of an airplane. It consists of an outer tube with a number of
small holes B (four are shown) that allow air into the tube; that
tube is connected to one arm of a U-tube. The other arm of the
U-tube is connected to hole A at the front end of the device, which
points in the direction the plane is headed. At A the air becomes
stagnant so that v, = 0. At B, however, the speed of the air presum-
ably equals the airspeed v of the plane. (a) Use Bernoulli’s equation

tains alcohol and the level difference h is 26.0 cm. What is the
plane’s speed relative to the air? The density of the air is 1.03 kg/m?
and that of alcohol is 810 kg/m’.
