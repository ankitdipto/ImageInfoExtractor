65 SSM WWW A venturi meter is used to measure the flow
speed of a fluid in a pipe. The meter is connected between two
sections of the pipe (Fig. 14-50); the cross-sectional area A of the
entrance and exit of the meter matches the pipe’s cross-sectional
area. Between the entrance and exit, the fluid flows from the
pipe with speed V and then through a narrow “throat” of cross-
sectional area a with speed v. A manometer connects the wider
portion of the meter to the narrower portion. The change in the
fluid’s speed is accompanied by a change Ap in the fluid’s pressure,
which causes a height difference h of the liquid in the two arms of
the manometer. (Here Ap means pressure in the throat minus pres-
sure in the pipe.) (a) By applying Bernoulli's equation and the
equation of continuity to points 1 and 2 in Fig. 14-50, show that

 

where p is the density of the fluid. (b) Suppose that the fluid is
fresh water, that the cross-sectional areas are 64 cm? in the pipe
and 32 cm? in the throat, and that the pressure is 55 kPa in the pipe
and 41 kPa in the throat. What is the rate of water flow in cubic
meters per second?

°°66 <%= Consider the venturi tube of Problem 65 and Fig. 14-50
without the manometer. Let A equal Sa. Suppose the pressure p; at A
is 2.0 atm. Compute the values of (a) the speed V at A and (b) the
speed v at a that make the pressure p at a equal to zero. (c) Compute
the corresponding volume flow rate if the diameter at A is 5.0. cm.
The phenomenon that occurs at a when p) falls to nearly zero is
known as cavitation. The water vaporizes into small bubbles.

72 @ A very simplified schem-

atic of the rain drainage system for a home is shown in Fig. 14-55.
Rain falling on the slanted roof runs off into gutters around the
roof edge; it then drains through downspouts (only one is
shown) into a main drainage pipe M below the basement, which
carries the water to an
even larger pipe below the
street. In Fig. 14-55, a floor
drain in the basement is
also connected to drain-
age pipe M. Suppose the
following apply:

height A, = 11m, (2) the
floor drain has height hy =
