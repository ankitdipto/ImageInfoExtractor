the water striking the roof goes through pipe M, (6) the initial speed
of the water in a downspout is negligible, and (7) the wind speed is
negligible (the rain falls vertically).

At what rainfall rate, in centimeters per hour, will water from
pipe M reach the height of the floor drain and threaten to flood
the basement?

73 About one-third of the body of a person floating in the
Dead Sea will be above the waterline. Assuming that the human
body density is 0.98 g/cm’, find the density of the water in the
Dead Sea. (Why is it so much greater than 1.0 g/cm}?)

74 A simple open U-tube contains mercury. When 11.2 cm of
water is poured into the right arm of the tube, how high above its
initial level does the mercury rise in the left arm?

75 <M Ifa bubble in sparkling water accelerates upward at the
rate of 0.225 m/s* and has a radius of 0.500 mm, what is its mass?
Assume that the drag force on the bubble is negligible.

76 <%= Suppose that your body has a uniform density of 0.95
times that of water. (a) If you float in a swimming pool, what frac-
tion of your body’s volume is above the water surface?

Quicksand is a fluid produced when water is forced up into
sand, moving the sand grains away from one another so they are no
longer locked together by friction. Pools of quicksand can form when
water drains underground from hills into valleys where there are
sand pockets (b) If you float in a deep pool of quicksand that has a
density 1.6 times that of water, what fraction of your body’s volume is
above the quicksand surface? (c) Are you unable to breathe?

77 A glass ball of radius 2.00 cm sits at the bottom of a container
of milk that has a density of 1.03 g/cm’. The normal force on the
ball from the container’s lower surface has magnitude 9.48 x 10-7 N.
What is the mass of the ball?

78 <$6= Caught in an avalanche, a skier is fully submerged in
flowing snow of density 96 kg/m*. Assume that the average density
of the skier, clothing, and skiing equipment is 1020 kg/m’, What
percentage of the gravitational force on the skier is offset by the
buoyant force from the snow?

79 An object hangs froma spring balance. The balance registers
30 N in air, 20 N when this object is immersed in water, and 24 N
when the object is immersed in another liquid of unknown den-
sity. What is the density of that other liquid?

80 Inan experiment, a rectangular block with height h is allowed
to float in four separate liquids. In the first liquid, which is water, it
floats fully submerged. In liquids A, B, and C, it floats with heights
h/2, 2h/3, and h/4 above the liquid surface, respectively. What are
the relative densities (the densities relative to that of water) of
(a) A,(b) B, and (c) C?

81 ssm Figure 14-30 shows a modified U-tube: the right arm is
shorter than the left arm. The open end of the right arm is height
d = 10.0cm above the laboratory bench. The radius throughout
the tube is 1.50 cm. Water is gradually poured into the open end of
the left arm until the water begins to flow out the open end of the
right arm. Then a liquid of density 0.80 g/cm’ is gradually added to
the left arm until its height in that arm is 8.0 cm (it does not mix
with the water). How much water flows out of the right arm?

82 What is the acceleration of a rising hot-air balloon if the ratio
of the air density outside the balloon to that inside is 1.39? Neglect
the mass of the balloon fabric and the basket.

83 <= Figure 14-56 shows a
siphon, which is a device for
removing liquid from a container.
Tube ABC must initially be filled,
but once this has been done, liquid
will flow through the tube until the
liquid surface in the container is
level with the tube opening at A.
The liquid has density 1000 kg/m’
and negligible viscosity. The dis-
tances shown are hy, = 25cm, d=
12cm, and hy = 40cm. (a) With
what speed does the liquid emerge ch
from the tube at C? (b) If the at-
mospheric pressure is 1.0 X 105 Pa,
what is the pressure in the liquid at
the topmost point B? (c) Theoretically, what is the greatest possi-
ble height /; that a siphon can lift water?

84 <= When you cough, you expel air at high speed through the
trachea and upper bronchi so that the air will remove excess mucus
lining the pathway. You produce the high speed by this procedure: You
breathe in a large amount of air, trap it by closing the glottis (the nar-
row opening in the larynx), increase the air pressure by contracting
the lungs, partially collapse the trachea and upper bronchi to narrow
the pathway, and then expel the air through the pathway by suddenly
reopening the glottis. Assume that during the expulsion the volume
flow rate is 7.0 X 10-3 m/s. What multiple of 343 m/s (the speed of
sound v,) is the airspeed through the trachea if the trachea diameter
(a) remains its normal value of 14 mm and (b) contracts to 5.2 mm?

85 A tin can has a total volume of 1200 cm’
and a mass of 130 g. How many grams of lead
shot of density 11.4 g/cm? could it carry with-
out sinking in water?

86 The tension in a string holding a solid
block below the surface of a liquid (of density
greater than the block) is T) when the container

given an upward acceleration of 0.250g, what
multiple of Ty gives the tension in the string?
