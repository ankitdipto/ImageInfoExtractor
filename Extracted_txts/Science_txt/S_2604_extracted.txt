Figure 15-2 (a) A sequence of “freeze-frames” (taken at equal time intervals) showing the position ofa par-
ticle as it oscillates back and forth about the origin of an x axis, between the limits +x,, and —x,,.(b)The
vector arrows are scaled to indicate the speed of the particle. The speed is maximum when the particle is at
the origin and zero when it is at +x,,.If the time ris chosen to be zero when the particle is at +,,,then the
particle returns to +x», at /= T,where Tis the period of the motion. The motion is then repeated. (c)
Rotating the figure reveals the motion forms a cosine function of time, as shown in (d). (e) The speed (the
slope) changes.
