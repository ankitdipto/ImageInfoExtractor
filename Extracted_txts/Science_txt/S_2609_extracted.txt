420 CHAPTER 15 OSCILLATIONS

Sample Problem 15.01

A block whose mass m is 680 g is fastened to a spring whose
spring constant k is 65 N/m. The block is pulled a distance
x = 11 cm from its equilibrium position at x = 0 on a fric-
tionless surface and released from rest at t = 0.

(a) What are the angular frequency, the frequency, and the
period of the resulting motion?

KEY IDEA

 

The block-spring system forms a linear simple harmonic
oscillator, with the block undergoing SHM.

Calculations: The angular frequency is given by Eq. 15-12:

k 65 N/m
a= = 0.68kg = 9.78 rad/s

 

=~ 9.8 rad/s. (Answer)
The frequency follows from Eq. 15-5, which yields
Sa screen EC omnes)
Qa 2arad
The period follows from Eq. 15-2, which yields
T= 7 = oe = 0.64s = 640 ms. (Answer)

(b) What is the amplitude of the oscillation?

KEY IDEA

 

With no friction involved, the mechanical energy of the spring—
block system is conserved.

Reasoning: The block is released from rest 11 cm from its
equilibrium position, with zero kinetic energy and the
elastic potential energy of the system at a maximum. Thus,
the block will have zero kinetic energy whenever it is
again 11 cm from its equilibrium position, which means it
will never be farther than 11 cm from that position. Its

maximum displacement is 11 cm:

(c) What is the maximum speed v,, of the oscillating block,
and where is the block when it has this speed?

KEY IDEA

 

The maximum speed v,,, is the velocity amplitude ax,,, in Eq. 15-6.
Calculation: Thus, we have
Vin = @Xm = (9.78 rad/s)(0.11 m)

=11m/s. (Answer)

Block-spring SHM, amplitude, acceleration, phase constant

This maximum speed occurs when the oscillating block is
rushing through the origin; compare Figs. 15-6a and 15-6b,
where you can see that the speed is a maximum whenever
x=0.

(d) What is the magnitude a,,, of the maximum acceleration
of the block?

KEY IDEA

 

The magnitude a,, of the maximum acceleration is the accel-
eration amplitude w°x,, in Eq. 15-7.

Calculation: So, we have
Gm = Xm = (9.78 rad/s)?(0.11 m)

=U ms. (Answer)

This maximum acceleration occurs when the block is at the
ends of its path, where the block has been slowed to a stop
so that its motion can be reversed. At those extreme
points, the force acting on the block has its maximum mag-
nitude; compare Figs. 15-6a and 15-6c, where you can see
that the magnitudes of the displacement and acceleration
are maximum at the same times, when the speed is zero, as
you can see in Fig. 15-6b.

(e) What is the phase constant ¢ for the motion?

Calculations: Equation 15-3 gives the displacement of the
block as a function of time. We know that at time t= 0,
the block is located at x =x,,. Substituting these initial
conditions, as they are called, into Eq. 15-3 and canceling x,,
give us

1=cos ¢. (15-14)
Taking the inverse cosine then yields
= Orad. (Answer)

(Any angle that is an integer multiple of 27rrad also satisfies
Eq. 15-14; we chose the smallest angle.)

(f) What is the displacement function x(t) for the
spring —block system?

Calculation: The function x(t) is given in general form by
Eg. 15-3. Substituting known quantities into that equation
gives us
x(0) = %p cost + 6)
= (0.11 m) cos[(9.8 rad/s)t + 0]
= 0.11 cos(9.8F), (Answer)

where xis in meters and fis in seconds.
