15-2 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

Sample Problem 15.02 Finding SHM phase constant from displacement and velocity

At t = 0, the displacement x(0) of the block in a linear oscil-
lator like that of Fig. 15-7 is —8.50 cm. (Read x(0) as “x at
time zero.”) The block’s velocity v(0) then is —0.920 m/s,
and its acceleration a(0) is +47.0 m/s*.

(a) What is the angular frequency of this system?

KEY IDEA

With the block in SHM, Egs. 15-3, 15-6, and 15-7 give its dis-
placement, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, and each
contains w.

Calculations: Let’s substitute t=0 into each to see
whether we can solve any one of them for w. We find

X(0) = Xp cos f, (15-15)
v(0) = —ax,, sin d, (15-16)
and a(0) = — aX, cos d. (15-17)

In Eg. 15-15, w has disappeared. In Eqs. 15-16 and 15-17, we
know values for the left sides, but we do not know x,, and ¢.
However, if we divide Eq. 15-17 by Eq. 15-15, we neatly elim-
inate both x,, and ¢ and can then solve for was

_ a0) _ 47.0 m/s
&*\ x0) V —0.0850m
= 23.5 rad/s. (Answer)
(b) What are the phase constant ¢ and amplitude x,,?

Calculations: We know w and want ¢ and x,,. If we divide
Eg. 15-16 by Eq. 15-15, we eliminate one of those unknowns
and reduce the other to a single trig function:

v0) — -ax,sing _

 

 

x0) x,cosé is
Solving for tan , we find
v(0) —0.920 m/s
t = SS
(0) (23.5 rad/s)(—0.0850 m)
= —0.461.

This equation has two solutions:
b= -25 and ¢=180° + (—25°) = 155°.

Normally only the first solution here is displayed by a calcu-
lator, but it may not be the physically possible solution. To
choose the proper solution, we test them both by using them
to compute values for the amplitude x,,,. From Eq. 15-15, we
find that if ¢ = —25°, then

_x(0) _ —0.0850. m
or a cos(—25°)

 

= —0.094 m.

We find similarly that if ¢= 155°, then x,, = 0.094 m.
Because the amplitude of SHM must be a positive constant,
the correct phase constant and amplitude here are

= 155° and x,, =0.094m=9.4cm. (Answer)

15.21 Sketch a graph of the kinetic energy, potential energy,
and total energy of a spring—block oscillator, first as a func-
tion of time and then as a function of the oscillator's position.

when itis entirely potential energy.

Let’s now examine the linear oscillator of Chapter 8, where we saw that the energy
transfers back and forth between kinetic energy and potential energy, while the sum
of the two—the mechanical energy E of the oscillator—remains constant. The
