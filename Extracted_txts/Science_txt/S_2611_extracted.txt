OY) pressed—that is, on x(t). We can use Eqs. 8-11 and 15-3 to find
U(t) = $kx? = 3x3, cos*(wt + 6). (15-18)
KY) Caution: A function written in the form cos” A (as here) means (cos A)’ and is not

the same as one written cos A”, which means cos(A’).

The kinetic energy of the system of Fig. 15-7 is associated entirely with the
block. Its value depends on how fast the block is moving —that is, on v(t). We can
use Eq. 15-6 to find

U(x) + K(x) If we use Eq. 15-12 to substitute k/m for w, we can write Eq. 15-19 as

The mechanical energy follows from Eqs. 15-18 and 15-20 and is

as functions of time f for a linear harmon-
ic oscillator. Note that all energies are
positive and that the potential energy and
the kinetic energy peak twice during
every period. (b) Potential energy U(x),
kinetic energy K(x), and mechanical energy
E as functions of position x for a linear
harmonic oscillator with amplitude x,,.

For x = 0 the energy is all kinetic, and for
‘Xm it is all potential.

The mechanical energy of a linear oscillator is indeed constant and independent of
time. The potential energy and kinetic energy of a linear oscillator are shown as
functions of time ¢ in Fig. 15-8a and as functions of displacement x in Fig. 15-8). In
any oscillating system, an element of springiness is needed to store the potential en-
ergy and an element of inertia is needed to store the kinetic energy.

In Fig, 15-7, the block has a kinetic energy of 3 J and the spring has an elastic potential
energy of 2 J when the block is at x = +2.0 cm. (a) What is the kinetic energy when

the block is atx = 0? What is the elastic potential energy when the block is at (b)

x = —2.0cm and (c)x = —X,?

 

 

Sample Problem 15.03 SHM potential energy, kinetic energy, mass dampers

Many tall buildings have mass dampers, which are anti-sway
devices to prevent them from oscillating in a wind. The de-
vice might be a block oscillating at the end of a spring and
on a lubricated track. If the building sways, say, eastward,
the block also moves eastward but delayed enough so that
when it finally moves, the building is then moving back
westward. Thus, the motion of the oscillator is out of step
with the motion of the building.

Suppose the block has mass m = 2.72 X 10° kg and is de-
signed to oscillate at frequency f= 10.0 Hz and with ampli-
tude x, =20.0 cm. ea a8

(a) What is the total mechanical energy E of the spring—
block system?

KEY IDEA

 

The mechanical energy E (the sum of the kinetic energy
K = jmv’ of the block and the potential energy U = 5kx? of
the spring) is constant throughout the motion of the oscillator.
Thus, we can evaluate E at any point during the motion.

Calculations: Because we are given amplitude x,,, of the os-
cillations, let’s evaluate E when the block is at position x = x,,,
