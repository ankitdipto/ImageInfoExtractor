15-3 AN ANGULAR SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

where it has velocity v = 0. However, to evaluate U at that
point, we first need to find the spring constant k. From
Eq. 15-12 (@ = Vkim) and Eq.15-5 (w = 2-7f),we find
k = mo = m(2af)*
= (2.72 X 10° kg)(277)?(10.0 Hz)”
= 1.073 x 10° N/m.
We can now evaluate E as
E=K+ U= mv? + 5k?
= 0 + 5(1.073 x 10? N/m)(0.20 m)?

= 2.147 x 1073 ~ 2.1 x 107J. (Answer)

423

(b) What is the block’s speed as it passes through the equi-
librium point?

Calculations: We want the speed at x=0, where the
potential energy is U = $x = Oand the mechanical energy
is entirely kinetic energy. So, we can write

E=K +U =3my + 5ke
2147 X 107 J = 4(2.72 x 105 kg)? + 0,
or v= 12.6 m/s. (Answer)

Because E is entirely kinetic energy, this is the maximum
speed v,,.

@ A torsion pendulum consists of an object suspended on a wire. When the wire is twisted and then released, the object oscil-
lates in angular simple harmonic motion with a period given by

T = 2m, s
K

where J is the rotational inertia of the object about the axis of rotation and « is the torsion constant of the wire.

 

An Angular Simple Harmonic Oscillator

Figure 15-9 shows an angular version of a simple harmonic oscillator; the element
of springiness or elasticity is associated with the twisting of a suspension wire
rather than the extension and compression of a spring as we previously had. The
device is called a torsion pendulum, with torsion referring to the twisting.

Tf we rotate the disk in Fig. 15-9 by some angular displacement 6 from its rest
position (where the reference line is at @ = 0) and release it, it will oscillate about
that position in angular simple harmonic motion. Rotating the disk through an
angle @in either direction introduces a restoring torque given by

Figure 15-9 A torsion pendulum is an angular
version of a linear simple harmonic oscilla-
tor. The disk oscillates in a horizontal plane;
the reference line oscillates with angular
amplitude 9,,. The twist in the suspension
wire stores potential energy as a spring does
and provides the restoring torque.

Here « (Greek kappa) is a constant, called the torsion constant, that depends on
the length, diameter, and material of the suspension wire.

Comparison of Eq. 15-22 with Eq. 15-10 leads us to suspect that Eq. 15-22 is
the angular form of Hooke’s law, and that we can transform Eq. 15-13, which
gives the period of linear SHM, into an equation for the period of angular SHM:
We replace the spring constant k in Eq. 15-13 with its equivalent, the constant
