424 CHAPTER 15 OSCILLATIONS

« of Eq. 15-22, and we replace the mass m in Eq. 15-13 with its equivalent, the
rotational inertia J of the oscillating disk. These replacements lead to

Figure 15-10a shows a thin rod whose length L is 12.4 cm and
whose mass m is 135 g, suspended at its midpoint from a long
wire. Its period T,, of angular SHM is measured to be 2.53 s.
An irregularly shaped object, which we call object X, is then
hung from the same wire, as in Fig. 15-10b, and its period T,, is
found to be 4.76 s. What is the rotational inertia of object XY
about its suspension axis?

KEY IDEA

 

The rotational inertia of either the rod or object X is related
to the measured period by Eq. 15-23.

Calculations: In Table 10-2e, the rotational inertia of a thin
rod about a perpendicular axis through its midpoint is given as
mL. Thus, we have, for the rod in Fig, 15-10a,

I, = mL? = (45)(0.135 kg)(0.124 m)?
= 1.73 x 10 kg-m?,

Now let us write Eq. 15-23 twice, once for the rod and once
for object X:

The constant «, which is a property of the wire, is the same for
both figures; only the periods and the rotational inertias differ.

Let us square each of these equations, divide the second
by the first, and solve the resulting equation for J, The result is

15.27 Describe the motion of an oscillating simple pendulum.

15.28 Draw a free-body diagram of a pendulum bob with the
pendulum at angle @ to the vertical.

15.29 For small-angle oscillations of a simple pendulum, relate
the period T (or frequency f) to the pendulum's length L.
15.30 Distinguish between a simple pendulum and a physical

pendulum.

15.31 For small-angle oscillations of a physical pendulum, re-
late the period T (or frequency f) to the distance h be-
tween the pivot and the center of mass.

15.32 For an angular oscillating system, determine the angu-
lar frequency w from either an equation relating torque r
and angular displacement @ or an equation relating angular
acceleration a and angular displacement 6.

15.33 Distinguish between a pendulum's angular frequency
«@ (having to do with the rate at which cycles are com-
pleted) and its d@/dt (the rate at which its angle with the
vertical changes).

15.34 Given data about the angular position @ and rate of
change dé/dt at one instant, determine the phase constant
and amplitude 4,,.

15.35 Describe how the free-fall acceleration can be mea-
sured with a simple pendulum.

15.36 For a given physical pendulum, determine the location
of the center of oscillation and identify the meaning of that
phrase in terms of a simple pendulum.

form circular motion.
