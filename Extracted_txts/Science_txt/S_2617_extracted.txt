Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion

In 1610, Galileo, using his newly constructed telescope, discovered the four prin-
cipal moons of Jupiter. Over weeks of observation, each moon seemed to him to
be moving back and forth relative to the planet in what today we would call
simple harmonic motion; the disk of the planet was the midpoint of the motion.
The record of Galileo’s observations, written in his own hand, is actually still
available. A. P. French of MIT used Galileo’s data to work out the position of the
moon Callisto relative to Jupiter (actually, the angular distance from Jupiter as
seen from Earth) and found that the data approximates the curve shown in Fig.
15-14. The curve strongly suggests Eq. 15-3, the displacement function for simple
harmonic motion. A period of about 16.8 days can be measured from the plot, but
itis a period of what exactly? After all, a moon cannot possibly be oscillating back
and forth like a block on the end of a spring, and so why would Eq. 15-3 have
anything to do with it?

Actually, Callisto moves with essentially constant speed in an essentially cir-
cular orbit around Jupiter. Its true motion —far from being simple harmonic—
is uniform circular motion along that orbit. What Galileo saw— and what you can
see with a good pair of binoculars and a little patience—is the projection of this
uniform circular motion on a line in the plane of the motion. We are led by
Galileo’s remarkable observations to the conclusion that simple harmonic

measurements approximate this curve, which suggests simple harmonic motion. At Jupiter's
mean distance from Earth, 10 minutes of arc corresponds to about 2 x 10° km. (Based on A. P.
