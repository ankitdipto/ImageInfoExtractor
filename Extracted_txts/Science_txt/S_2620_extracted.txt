15-5 DAMPED SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

 

Figure 15-17 The displacement function x(f) for the damped oscillator of Fig. 15-16. The ampli-
tude, which is x, e~”"”, decreases exponentially with time.

Substituting dx/dt for v and d?x/dt? for a and rearranging give us the differential
equation

ax dx
—> + b— + kx = 0. 15-41
"ae dt * ( )

The solution of this equation is

X(t) = Xp e7"!" cos(w't + ), (15-42)

where x,,, is the amplitude and w’ is the angular frequency of the damped oscilla-
tor. This angular frequency is given by

(15-43)

 

If b = 0 (there is no damping), then Eq. 15-43 reduces to Eq. 15-12 (# = Vk/m)
for the angular frequency of an undamped oscillator, and Eq. 15-42 reduces to
Eg. 15-3 for the displacement of an undamped oscillator. If the damping constant
is small but not zero (so that b < Vkm), then w! ~ w.

Damped Energy. We can regard Eq. 15-42 as a cosine function whose amplitude,
which is x, e7""™", gradually decreases with time, as Fig. 15-17 suggests. For an un-
damped oscillator, the mechanical energy is constant and is given by Eq. 15-21 (E =
3kx3,). If the oscillator is damped, the mechanical energy is not constant but decreases
with time. If the damping is small, we can find E(¢) by replacing x,, in Eq. 15-21 with
Xm e7”"”, the amplitude of the damped oscillations. By doing so, we find that

E(t) = phot,e™, (15-44)

which tells us that, like the amplitude, the mechanical energy decreases exponen-
tially with time.

Here are three sets of values for the spring constant, damping constant, and mass
for the damped oscillator of Fig, 15-16. Rank the sets according to the time re-
quired for the mechanical energy to decrease to one-fourth of its initial value,
greatest first.
