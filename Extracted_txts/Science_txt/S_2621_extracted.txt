Sample Problem 15.06 Damped harmonic oscillator, time to decay, energy

For the damped oscillator of Fig. 15-16, m= 250g, k=
85 N/m, and b = 70 g/s.

(a) What is the period of the motion?
KEY IDEA

 

Because b < Vkm = 4.6 kg/s, the period is approximately
that of the undamped oscillator.

Calculation: From Eq. 15-13, we then have

_ mM _ 0.25 kg _
T=20 5 = 20 85Nim > 024s

(b) How long does it take for the amplitude of the damped
oscillations to drop to half its initial value?

 

(Answer)

KEY IDEA

The amplitude at time ¢ is displayed in Eq. 15-42 as x, e~%".

Calculations: The amplitude has the value x,, at t = 0. Thus,
we must find the value of t for which

Xm€ Xm

Canceling x,, and taking the natural logarithm of the equa-
tion that remains, we have In} on the right side and

In(e~#2") = —bt/2m

on the left side. Thus,
p= amin 3 _ = (2)(0.25 kg)(In 3)
b 0.070 kg/s
=5.0s. (Answer)
Because T = 0.34 s, this is about 15 periods of oscillation.
(c) How long does it take for the mechanical energy to drop
to one-half its initial value?

KEY IDEA

From Eq. 15-44, the mechanical energy at time fis $kx3,, e”.

Calculations: The mechanical energy has the value
3k, att = 0.Thus, we must find the value of t for which

Bev eM" = 3k).

If we divide both sides of this equation by 3k, and solve for
tas we did above, we find

= (025 kg)(In 3) _
—  b 0.070 kgs
This is exactly half the time we calculated in (b), or about

7.5 periods of oscillation. Figure 15-17 was drawn to illus-
trate this sample problem.

Learning Objectives

 

After reading this module, you should be able to...

15.43 Distinguish between natural angular frequency w and
driving angular frequency wz.

15.44 For a forced oscillator, sketch a graph of the oscillation
amplitude versus the ratio «,/w of driving angular fre-

quency to natural angular frequency, identify the approxi-
mate location of resonance, and indicate the effect of in-
creasing the damping constant.

15.45 Fora given natural angular frequency «, identify the ap-
proximate driving angular frequency «w, that gives resonance.

 

Key Ideas
@ If an external driving force with angular frequency a, acts
onan oscillating system with natural angular frequency «, the
system oscillates with angular frequency w,.

@ The velocity amplitude v,,, of the system is greatest when

gq = @,

a condition called resonance. The amplitude x,,, of the system
is (approximately) greatest under the same condition.

Forced Oscillations and Resonance

A person swinging in a swing without anyone pushing it is an example of free
oscillation. However, if someone pushes the swing periodically, the swing has
