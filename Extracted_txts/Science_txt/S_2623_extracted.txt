434 CHAPTER 15 OSCILLATIONS

Review & Summary

Frequency The frequency f of periodic, or oscillatory, motion is
the number of oscillations per second. In the SI system, it is mea-
sured in hertz:

1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1 s~'. (15-1)

Period The period Tis the time required for one complete oscil-
lation, or eyele. It is related to the frequency by

T=—. (15-2)

Simple Harmonic Motion In simple harmonic motion (SHM),
the displacement x(t) of a particle from its equilibrium position is
described by the equation

Xn COs(cot + ) (15-3)

in which x,, is the amplitude of the displacement, wt + ¢ is the
phase of the motion, and ¢ is the phase constant. The angular fre-
quency wis related to the period and frequency of the motion by

Differentiating Eq. 15-3 leads to equations for the particle’s SHM

velocity and acceleration as functions of time:

(angular frequency). (15-5)

v= ax, sin(ot + 4) (15-6)
and a = —wx,, cos(wt + $) (15-7)

In Eq. 15-6, the positive quantity wx,, is the velocity amplitude v,,
of the motion. In Eq. 15-7, the positive quantity wx, is the aeceler-
ation amplitude a,, of the motion.

(acceleration).

The Linear Oscillator A particle with mass m that moves un-
der the influence of a Hooke’s law restoring force given by F =
—kx exhibits simple harmonic motion with

o=, [z (angular frequency) (15-12)

and T = 2n,} (period). (15-13)

Such a system is called a linear simple harmonic oscillator.

Energy A particle in simple harmonic motion has, at any time,
kinetic energy K = jmv* and potential energy U = 3kx°. If no fric-
tion is present, the mechanical energy E = K + U remains con-
stant even though K and U change.

Pendulums Examples of devices that undergo simple
harmonic motion are the torsion pendulum of Fig. 15-9, the simple
pendulum of Fig. 15-11, and the physical pendulum of Fig. 15-12.
Their periods of oscillation for small oscillations are, respectively,

T =27V ilk (torsion pendulum), (15-23)
T=27VLig (simple pendulum), (15-28)
T=22Vilmgh (physical pendulum). (15-29)

Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion
Simple harmonic motion is the projection of uniform circular
motion onto the diameter of the circle in which the circular motion
occurs. Figure 15-15 shows that all parameters of circular motion
(position, velocity, and acceleration) project to the corresponding
values for simple harmonic motion.

Damped Harmonic Motion The mechanical energy E ina real
oscillating system decreases during the oscillations because external
forces, such as a drag force, inhibit the oscillations and transfer me-
chanical energy to thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion
are then said to be damped. If the damping force is given by F, =
—bv, where Vis the velocity of the oscillator and b is a damping con-
stant, then the displacement of the oscillator is given by

X(t) = Xp, eP!2" cos(w't + 4), (15-42)

where w’, the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is

given by

If the damping constant is small (b < Vkm), then w' ~ w, where w
is the angular frequency of the undamped oscillator. For small b,
the mechanical energy E of the oscillator is given by

E(t) ~ 3k, eo. (15-44)

Forced Oscillations and Resonance If an external
driving force with angular frequency @, acts on an oscillating sys-
tem with natural angular frequency , the system oscillates with
angular frequency w,. The velocity amplitude v,, of the system is
greatest when

(15-46)
a condition called resonance. The amplitude x,, of the system is
(approximately) greatest under the same condition.
