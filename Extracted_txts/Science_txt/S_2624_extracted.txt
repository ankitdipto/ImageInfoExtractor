so that it is a plot of acceleration a
versus time f for the spring—block
oscillator that is shown in Fig. 15-

the x(f) curves for three
experiments involving a
particular spring—box
system oscillating in
SHM. Rank the curves
according to (a) the sys-
tem’s angular frequency,
(b) the spring’s poten-
tial energy at time t= 0,
(c) the box’s kinetic en-
ergy at t=0, (d) the
box’s speed at f = 0, and (e) the box’s maximum kinetic energy, great-
est first.

are rigidly connected by identical rods
of negligible mass. Each pendulum is

10 You are to build the oscillation
transfer device shown in Fig, 15-27. It

consists of two spring—block systems
hanging from a flexible rod. When e e@ e
the spring of system 1 is stretched ( (0) (9)

and then released, the resulting SHM
of system 1 at frequency f, oscillates
the rod. The rod then exerts a driving force on system 2, at the same
frequency f,. You can choose from four springs with spring constants
k of 1600, 1500, 1400, and 1200 N/m, and four blocks with masses m of
800, 500, 400, and 200 kg. Mentally determine which spring should go
with which block in each of the two systems to maximize the ampli-
tude of oscillations in system 2.

11 In Fig. 15-28, a spring—block
system is put into SHM in two ex-
periments. In the first, the block is
pulled from the equilibrium position
through a displacement d; and then dy
released. In the second, it is pulled . .

through a greater displacement d, and then released. Are the
(a) amplitude, (b) period, (c) frequency, (d) maximum kinetic en-
ergy, and (e) maximum potential energy in the second experiment
greater than, less than, or the same as those in the first experiment?

 

12 Figure 15-29 gives, for three situations, the displacements x(f)
of a pair of simple harmonic oscillators (A and B) that are identical
except for phase. For each pair, what phase shift (in radians and in
degrees) is needed to shift the curve for A to coincide with the
curve for B? Of the many possible answers, choose the shift with
the smallest absolute magnitude.
