°°21 ILw In Fig. 15-31, two

springs are attached to a block vy (cm/s)
that can oscillate over a fric- ¥,
tionless floor. If the left spring
is removed, the block oscil-
lates at a frequency of 30 Hz.
If, instead, the spring on the
right is removed, the block os-
cillates at a frequency of 45
Hz. At what frequency does
the block oscillate with both
springs attached?

+22 @ Figure 15-34 shows
block 1 of mass 0.200 kg slid-
ing to the right over a friction-
less elevated surface at a
speed of 8.00 m/s. The block
undergoes an elastic collision
with stationary block 2, which
is attached to a spring of spring
constant 1208.5 N/m. (Assume
that the spring does not affect the collision.) After the collision,
block 2 oscillates in SHM with a period of 0.140 s, and block 1
slides off the opposite end of the elevated surface, landing a dis-
tance d from the base of that surface after falling height h = 4.90
m. What is the value of d?

between block and surface is 0.50. How great can the amplitude of
