“50 A thin uniform rod (mass = 0.50 kg) swings about an
axis that passes through one end of the rod and is perpendicu-
lar to the plane of the swing. The
rod swings with a period of 1.5s
and an angular amplitude of 10°.

length L=1.85m oscillates as a
physical pendulum. (a) What value
of distance x between the stick’s
center of mass and its pivot point O
gives the least period? (b) What is
that least period?

°°52 @ The 3.00 kg cube in Fig. 15-47 has edge
lengths d= 6.00 cm and is mounted on an axle
through its center. A spring (k = 1200 N/m) con-
nects the cube’s upper corner to a rigid wall.
Initially the spring is at its rest length. If the cube
is rotated 3° and released, what is the period of
the resulting SHM?

53 SSM _ ILW In the overhead view of Fig. 15-
48, a long uniform rod of mass 0.600 kg is free to
rotate in a horizontal plane about a Wall
vertical axis through its center. A
spring with force constant k = 1850
N/m is connected horizontally be- &
tween one end of the rod and a
fixed wall. When the rod is in equi-
librium, it is parallel to the wall.
What is the period of the small os-
cillations that result when the rod is rotated slightly and released?

54 ® In Fig 15-49a,a metal plate is mounted on an axle through
its center of mass. A spring with k = 2000 N/m connects a wall with a
point on the rim a distance r=2.5 cm from the center of mass.
Initially the spring is at its rest length. If the plate is rotated by 7° and
released, it rotates about the axle in SHM, with its angular position
given by Fig, 15-49b. The horizontal axis scale is set by /, = 20 ms. What
is the rotational inertia of the plate about its center of mass?

+55 @ A pendulum is formed by pivoting a long thin rod
about a point on the rod. In a series of experiments, the period is
measured as a function of the distance x between the pivot point
and the rod’s center. (a) If the rod’s length is L = 2.20 m and its
mass is m = 22.1 g, what is the minimum period? (b) If x is cho-

sen to minimize the period and then L is increased, does the pe-
riod increase, decrease, or remain the same? (c) If, instead, m is in-
creased without L increasing, does

the period increase, decrease, or re-

main the same?

oted at its end. (a) With the massless

torsion constant of the spring if the

creased by 0.500 s?

3.0% during each cycle. What percentage of the mechanical energy
of the oscillator is lost in each cycle?

m = 250 g, k = 85 N/m, and b = 70 g/s, what is the ratio of the oscil-
lation amplitude at the end of 20 cycles to the initial oscillation
amplitude?

8.00 N/m. The damping force is given by —b(dx/dt), where b = 230
g/s. The block is pulled down 12.0 cm and released. (a) Calculate
the time required for the amplitude of the resulting oscillations to
fall to one-third of its initial value. (b) How many oscillations are
made by the block in this time?

car body rise on its suspension?
