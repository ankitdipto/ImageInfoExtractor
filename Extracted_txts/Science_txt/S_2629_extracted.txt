Additional Problems

64 <%= Although California is known for earthquakes, it has
large regions dotted with precariously balanced rocks that would
be easily toppled by even a mild earthquake. Apparently no major
earthquakes have occurred in those regions. If an earthquake were
to put such a rock into sinusoidal oscillation (parallel to the
ground) with a frequency of 2.2 Hz, an oscillation amplitude of 1.0
cm would cause the rock to topple. What would be the magnitude
of the maximum acceleration of the oscillation,in terms of g?

65 A loudspeaker diaphragm is oscillating in simple harmonic
motion with a frequency of 440 Hz and a maximum displacement
of 0.75 mm. What are the (a) angular frequency, (b) maximum
speed, and (c) magnitude of the maximum acceleration?

66 A uniform spring with k = 8600 N/m is cut into pieces 1 and 2
of unstretched lengths L; = 7.0 cm and L, = 10 cm. What are
(a) k; and (b) k,? A block attached to the original spring as in
Fig. 15-7 oscillates at 200 Hz. What is the oscillation frequency of
the block attached to (c) piece 1 and (d) piece 2?

67 @ In Fig. 15-51, three 10 000 kg
ore cars are held at rest on a mine
railway using a cable that is parallel
to the rails, which are inclined at an-
gle @= 30°. The cable stretches 15
cm just before the coupling between
the two lower cars breaks, detaching
the lowest car. Assuming that the ca-
ble obeys Hooke’s law, find the (a)
frequency and (b) amplitude of the
resulting oscillations of the remain-
ing two cars.

68 A 200kg block hangs from a
spring. A 300 g body hung below the block stretches the spring 2.00 cm
farther. (a) What is the spring constant? (b) If the 300 g body is removed
and the block is set into oscillation, find the period of the motion.

69 ssM In the engine of a locomotive, a cylindrical piece known
asa piston oscillates in SHM in a cylinder head (cylindrical cham-
ber) with an angular frequency of 180 rev/min. Its stroke (twice the

70 @ A wheel is free to rotate about its fixed axle. A spring is at-
tached to one of its spokes a distance r from the axle, as shown in Fig.

what is the angular frequency w of

small oscillations of this system in hk

terms of m, R, r,and the spring con-
stant k? What is wif (b) r = Rand (c)
r=0?

71 A 500g stone is attached to
the bottom of a vertical spring and
set vibrating. If the maximum speed
of the stone is 15.0 cm/s and the pe-
riod is 0.5005, find the (a) spring
constant of the spring, (b) amplitude of the motion, and (c) fre-
quency of oscillation.

72 A uniform circular disk whose radius R is 12.6 cm is suspended
as a physical pendulum from a point on its rim. (a) What is its pe-
riod? (b) At what radial distance r < R is there a pivot point that
gives the same period?

73 ssm A vertical spring stretches 9.6 cm when a 1.3 kg block

 

is hung from its end. (a) Calculate the spring constant. This block
is then displaced an additional 5.0 cm downward and released
from rest. Find the (b) period, (c) frequency, (d) amplitude, and
(ec) maximum speed of the resulting SHM.

74 Amassless spring with spring constant 19 N/m hangs vertically.
A body of mass 0.20 kg is attached to its free end and then released.
Assume that the spring was unstretched before the body was re-
leased. Find (a) how far below the initial position the body descends,
and the (b) frequency and (c) amplitude of the resulting SHM.

75 A4.00kg block is suspended froma spring with k = 500 N/m. A
50.0 g bullet is fired into the block from directly below with a speed of
150 m/s and becomes embedded in the block. (a) Find the amplitude
of the resulting SHM. (b) What percentage of the original kinetic en-
ergy of the bullet is transferred to mechanical energy of the oscillator?

76 A 55.0g block oscillates in SHM on the end of a spring with
k = 1500.Nim according to x = x» cos(wt + $). How long does
the block take to move from position +0.800x,, to (a) position
+0.600x,, and (b) position —0.800x,,?

77 Figure 15-53 gives the position of a 20 g block oscillating
in SHM on the end of a spring. The horizontal axis scale is set
by ¢, = 40.0 ms. What are (a) the maximum kinetic energy of the
block and (b) the number of times per second that maximum is
reached? (Hint: Measuring a slope will probably not be very ac-
curate. Find another approach.)
