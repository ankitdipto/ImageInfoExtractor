16-3 ENERGY AND POWER OF A WAVE TRAVELING ALONG A STRING

where u is the transverse speed of the oscillating string element. To find u, we
differentiate Eq. 16-2 with respect to time while holding x constant:

 

ay
u= ~ = ayn cos(kx — wt). (16-28)
Using this relation and putting dm = pu dx, we rewrite Eq. 16-27 as
dK = 3(wdx)(— ayn)? cos*(kx — wt). (16-29)

Dividing Eq. 16-29 by dt gives the rate at which kinetic energy passes through
a string element, and thus the rate at which kinetic energy is carried along by the
wave. The dx/dt that then appears on the right of Eq. 16-29 is the wave speed v, so
= = Suvery?, cos*(kx — wt). (16-30)

The average rate at which kinetic energy is transported is

(*) = savory}, [cos*(kx — wf) avg

= juvery3,. (16-31)

Here we have taken the average over an integer number of wavelengths and
have used the fact that the average value of the square of a cosine function over
an integer number of periods is }

Elastic potential energy is also carried along with the wave, and at the same
average rate given by Eq. 16-31. Although we shall not examine the proof, you
should recall that, in an oscillating system such as a pendulum or a spring—block
system, the average kinetic energy and the average potential energy are equal.

The average power, which is the average rate at which energy of both kinds
is transmitted by the wave, is then

dK
Payg = 2 (“) (16-32)
dt Jovy
or, from Eq. 16-31,
Payy = 34V027Y%y (average power). (16-33)
The factors w and v in this equation depend on the material and tension of the
string. The factors w and y,,, depend on the process that generates the wave. The de-

pendence of the average power of a wave on the square of its amplitude and also on
the square of its angular frequency is a general result, true for waves of all types.
