Acceleration. The acceleration a, in Eq. 16-34 is the second derivative of the
displacement y with respect to time:

@y

ay = Gr (16-36)

Forces. Figure 16-11b shows that Fy is tangent to the string at the right end
of the string element.Thus we can relate the components of the force to the string
slope S> at the right end as F

2y

Pry
We can also relate the components to the magnitude F, (= 7) with
Fy= VF3, + F3y
or t= VFi, + FR. (16-38)

However, because we assume that the element is only slightly tilted, F), < Fy, and
therefore we can rewrite Eq. 16-38 as

 

=S, (16-37)

T=FPy. (16-39)
Substituting this into Eq. 16-37 and solving for Fy, yield
Fry = 1S). (16-40)
Similar analysis at the left end of the string element gives us
Fy = 7S,. (16-41)

Net Force. We can now substitute Eqs. 16-35, 16-36, 16-40, and 16-41 into
Eg. 16-34 to write

or dk de (16-42)
Because the string element is short, slopes S, and S, differ by only a differential
amount dS, where S is the slope at any point:
dy
S= a (16-43)
First replacing S, — S, in Eq. 16-42 with dS and then using Eq. 16-43 to substitute
dy/dx for S, we find

In the last step, we switched to the notation of partial derivatives because on
the left we differentiate only with respect to x and on the right we differenti-
ate only with respect to ¢. Finally, substituting from Eq. 16-26 (v = V7/), we
find

This is the general differential equation that governs the travel of waves of all
types.
