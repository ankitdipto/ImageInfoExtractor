The Human Genetic Map

Genetic maps of human chromosomes (figure 13.34) are of
great importance. Knowing where particular genes are lo-
cated on human chromosomes can often be used to tell
whether a fetus at risk of inheriting a genetic disorder actu-
ally has the disorder. The genetic-engineering techniques
described in chapter 19 have begun to permit investigators
to isolate specific genes and determine their nucleotide se-
quences. It is hoped that knowledge of differences at the
gene level may suggest successful therapies for particular
genetic disorders and that knowledge of a gene’s location
on a chromosome will soon permit the substitution of nor-
mal alleles for dysfunctional ones. Because of the great po-
tential of this approach, investigators are working hard to
assemble a detailed map of the entire human genome, the
Human Genome Project, described in chapter 19. Ini-
tially, this map will consist of a “library” of thousands of
small fragments of DNA whose relative positions are
known. Investigators wishing to study a particular gene will
first use techniques described in chapter 19 to screen this
library and determine which fragment carries the gene of
interest. They will then be able to analyze that fragment in
detail. In parallel with this mammoth undertaking, the
other, smaller genomes have already been sequenced, in-
cluding those of yeasts and several bacteria. Progress on the
human genome is rapid, and the full map is expected within
the next 10 years.

 

Gene maps locate the relative positions of different
genes on the chromosomes of an organism.
Traditionally produced by analyzing the relative
amounts of recombination in genetic crosses, gene

maps are increasingly being made by analyzing the sizes
of fragments made by restriction enzymes.
