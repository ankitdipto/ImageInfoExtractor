“The phase difference is between two otherwise identical waves, with amplitude y,,, moving in the
same direction.

and so the simpler of the two numbers can be used in computations. Thus, by
looking at only the decimal number and comparing it to 0,0.5, or 1.0 wavelength,
you can quickly tell what type of interference two waves have.

Iv] Checkpoint 4

Here are four possible phase differences between two identical waves, expressed in

 

wavelengths:
resultant wave, greatest first.

Sample Problem 16.04

Two identical sinusoidal waves, moving in the same
direction along a stretched string, interfere with each other.
The amplitude y,, of each wave is 9.8 mm, and the phase
difference @ between them is 100°.

(a) What is the amplitude y’,, of the resultant wave due to the
interference, and what is the type of this interference?

KEY IDEA

 

These are identical sinusoidal waves traveling in the same
direction along a string, so they interfere to produce a
sinusoidal traveling wave.

Calculations: Because they are identical, the waves have
the same amplitude. Thus, the amplitude y’,, of the resultant
wave is given by Eq. 16-52:

= [2y, cos $41 = |(2)(9.8 mm) cos(100°/2)|

= 13mm.

(Answer)

‘We can tell that the interference is intermediate in two ways.
The phase difference is between 0 and 180°, and, correspond-
ingly, the amplitude y’,, is between 0 and 2y,, (= 19.6 mm).

Interference of two waves, same direction, same amplitude

(b) What phase difference, in radians and wavelengths, will
give the resultant wave an amplitude of 4.9 mm?

Calculations: Now we are given y’,, and seek ¢. From Eq.
16-52,
Yin = 2ym cos 39,
we now have
4.9 mm = (2)(9.8 mm) cos 34,
which gives us (with a calculator in the radian mode)
4.9 mm
(2)(9.8 mm)
= £2.636 rad ~ +2.6 rad.

@=2cos!

(Answer)

There are two solutions because we can obtain the same re-
sultant wave by letting the first wave /ead (travel ahead of)
or lag (travel behind) the second wave by 2.6 rad. In wave-
lengths, the phase difference is

od _ +2.636 rad
2mrad/wavelength  27rrad/wavelength
= +0.42 wavelength. (Answer)
