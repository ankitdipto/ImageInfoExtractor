Figure 16-15. (a)-(d) A phasor of magnitude y,,; rotating about an origin at angular speed w represents a sinusoidal wave. The phasor’s
projection y; on the vertical axis represents the displacement of a point through which the wave passes. (e) A second phasor, also of
angular speed w but of magnitude y,,. and rotating at a constant angle ¢ from the first phasor, represents a second wave, with a phase
constant ¢. (f) The resultant wave is represented by the vector sum y’,, of the two phasors.
