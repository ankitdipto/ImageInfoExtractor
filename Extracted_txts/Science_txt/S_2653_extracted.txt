where y’,, is the amplitude of the resultant wave and £ is its phase constant. To
find the values of y},, and 8, we would have to sum the two combining waves, as
we did to obtain Eq. 16-51. To do this on a phasor diagram, we vectorially add the
two phasors at any instant during their rotation, as in Fig. 16-15f where phasor y,,,.
has been shifted to the head of phasor y,,;. The magnitude of the vector sum
equals the amplitude y’,, in Eq. 16-57. The angle between the vector sum and the
phasor for y, equals the phase constant Bin Eq. 16-57.

Sample Problem 16.05

Two sinusoidal waves y;(x, t) and y,(x, t) have the same
wavelength and travel together in the same direction along
a string. Their amplitudes are y,,,; = 4.0 mm and yy. = 3.0
mm, and their phase constants are 0 and 7/3 rad, respec-
tively. What are the amplitude y’,, and phase constant £ of
the resultant wave? Write the resultant wave in the form of
Eq. 16-57.

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The two waves have a number of properties in com-
mon: Because they travel along the same string, they must
have the same speed v, as set by the tension and linear
density of the string according to Eq. 16-26. With the
same wavelength A, they have the same angular wave
number k (= 27/A). Also, because they have the same
wave number k and speed v, they must have the same an-
gular frequency w (= kv).

(2) The waves (call them waves 1| and 2) can be repre-
sented by phasors rotating at the same angular speed w
about an origin. Because the phase constant for wave 2 is
greater than that for wave 1 by 7/3, phasor 2 must /ag pha-
sor | by 7/3 rad in their clockwise rotation, as shown in
Fig. 16-16a. The resultant wave due to the interference of
waves 1 and 2 can then be represented by a phasor that is
the vector sum of phasors 1 and 2.

Calculations: To simplify the vector summation, we drew
phasors | and 2 in Fig. 16-16a at the instant when phasor 1
lies along the horizontal axis. We then drew lagging
phasor 2 at positive angle 7/3 rad. In Fig. 16-16)
we shifted phasor 2 so its tail is at the head of phasor 1.
Then we can draw the phasor y', of the resultant
wave from the tail of phasor 1 to the head of phasor 2.
The phase constant # is the angle phasor y',, makes with
phasor 1.

To find values for y',, and 8, we can sum phasors 1 and
2 as vectors on a vector-capable calculator. However, here

Interference of two waves, same direction, phasors, any amplitudes

we shall sum them by components. (They are called hori-
zontal and vertical components, because the symbols x and
y are already used for the waves themselves.) For the hori-
zontal components we have

Vinh = Yi COS O + Ying COS 7/3
= 4.0 mm + (3.0mm) cos 7/3 = 5.50 mm.
For the vertical components we have
Yiny = Yi SiO + Yng sin 73
= 0 + (3.0 mm) sin 7/3 = 2.60 mm.

Thus, the resultant wave has an amplitude of

yn = V (5.50 mm)? + (2.60 mm)?

= 61mm (Answer)
and a phase constant of
B= tan? 2c 0.44 rad. (Answer)
5.50 mm - .

From Fig. 16-16b, phase constant £ is a positive angle rela-
tive to phasor 1. Thus, the resultant wave lags wave | in their
travel by phase constant B = +0.44 rad. From Eq. 16-57, we

can write the resultant wave as
y' (x,t) = (6.1 mm) sin(kx — wt + 0.44 rad). (Answer)

Add the phasors
as vectors.
