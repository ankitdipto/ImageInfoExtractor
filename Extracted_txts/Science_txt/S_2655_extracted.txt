principle graphically. The outstanding feature of the resultant wave is that there are
places along the string, called nodes, where the string never moves. Four such nodes
are marked by dots in Fig. 16-17c. Halfway between adjacent nodes are antinodes,
where the amplitude of the resultant wave is a maximum. Wave patterns such as
that of Fig. 16-17c are called standing waves because the wave patterns do not
move left or right; the locations of the maxima and minima do not change.

Oo If two sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude and wavelength travel in opposite
directions along a stretched string, their interference with each other produces a
standing wave.

To analyze a standing wave, we represent the two waves with the equations
Vi(X, 0) = Ym sin(kx — wt) (16-58)
and VAX, t) = Ym Sin(kx + wt). (16-59)
The principle of superposition gives, for the combined wave,
y' (x, t) = yi(x, t) + yo(x, t) = yn sin(kx — wf) + y,, sin(kx + of).
Applying the trigonometric relation of Eq. 16-50 leads to Fig. 16-18 and

y'(x, t) = [2ym sin kx] cos wt. (16-60)

This equation does not describe a traveling wave because it is not of the form of
Eq. 16-17. Instead, it describes a standing wave.

The quantity 2y,, sin kx in the brackets of Eq. 16-60 can be viewed as the
amplitude of oscillation of the string element that is located at position x.
However, since an amplitude is always positive and sin kx can be negative, we
take the absolute value of the quantity 2y,,, sin kx to be the amplitude at x.

In a traveling sinusoidal wave, the amplitude of the wave is the same for all
string elements. That is not true for a standing wave, in which the amplitude varies
with position. In the standing wave of Eq. 16-60, for example, the amplitude is
zero for values of kx that give sin kx = 0. Those values are

kx =n, forn =0,1,2,.... (16-61)

Substituting k = 277/A in this equation and rearranging, we get

 

n 4 forn = 0,1,2,... (nodes), (16-62)
as the positions of zero amplitude—the nodes—for the standing wave of
Eg. 16-60. Note that adjacent nodes are separated by A/2, half a wavelength.

The amplitude of the standing wave of Eq. 16-60 has a maximum value of
2Ym, Which occurs for values of kx that give |sin kx! = 1.Those values are

=1,3,5
kx = 377,577, 577,...

Substituting k = 27/A in Eq. 16-63 and rearranging, we get

x=(n+ a) forn =0,1,2,... (antinodes), (16-64)

as the positions of maximum amplitude—the antinodes—of the standing wave
of Eq. 16-60. Antinodes are separated by A/2 and are halfway between nodes.
Reflections at a Boundary

We can set up a standing wave in a stretched string by allowing a traveling wave
to be reflected from the far end of the string so that the wave travels back
