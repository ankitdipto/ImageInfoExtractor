Sample Problem 16.06 Resonance of transverse waves, standing waves, harmonics

Figure 16-23 shows resonant oscillation of a string of mass
m= 2.500 g and length L = 0.800 m and that is under tension
7= 325.0 N. What is the wavelength A of the transverse
waves producing the standing wave pattern, and what is the
harmonic number n? What is the frequency f of the trans-
verse waves and of the oscillations of the moving string ele-
ments? What is the maximum magnitude of the transverse
velocity u,, of the element oscillating at coordinate x = 0.180 m?
At what point during the element’s oscillation is the trans-
verse velocity maximum?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The traverse waves that produce a standing wave pattern
must have a wavelength such that an integer number n of
half-wavelengths fit into the length L of the string. (2) The
frequency of those waves and of the oscillations of the string
elements is given by Eq. 16-66 (f=nv/2L). (3) The displace-
ment of a string element as a function of position x and time
tis given by Eq. 16-60:

y' (x,t) = [2ym sin kx] cos wt. (16-67)
Wavelength and harmonic number: In Fig. 16-23, the solid
line, which is effectively a snapshot (or freeze-frame) of the
oscillations, reveals that 2 full wavelengths fit into the length
L =0.800 m of the string. Thus, we have

2A=L,

Es
or A= re (16-68)
= —n = 0.400 m. (Answer)

By counting the number of loops (or half-wavelengths) in
Fig. 16-23, we see that the harmonic number is
n=4, (Answer)

‘We also find n = 4 by comparing Eqs. 16-68 and 16-65 (A=
2L/n).Thus, the string is oscillating in its fourth harmonic.

Frequency: We can get the frequency fof the transverse waves
from Eq. 16-13 (v = Af) if we first find the speed v of the waves.
That speed is given by Eq. 16-26, but we must substitute m/L for
the unknown linear density 2. We obtain

Note that we get the same answer by substituting into Eq.
16-66:

~~ 2L- ~~ 20.800 m)
= 806 Hz. (Answer)

Now note that this 806 Hz is not only the frequency of the
waves producing the fourth harmonic but also it is said to be
the fourth harmonic, as in the statement, “The fourth
harmonic of this oscillating string is 806 Hz.” It is also the
frequency of the string elements as they oscillate vertically
in the figure in simple harmonic motion, just as a block on a
vertical spring would oscillate in simple harmonic motion.
Finally, it is also the frequency of the sound you would hear
as the oscillating string periodically pushes against the air.

Transverse velocity: The displacement y’ of the string
element located at coordinate x is given by Eq. 16-67 as a
function of time t. The term cos wt contains the dependence
on time and thus provides the “motion” of the standing
wave. The term 2y,, sin kx sets the extent of the motion—
that is, the amplitude. The greatest amplitude occurs at an
antinode, where sin kx is +1 or —1 and thus the greatest
amplitude is 2y,,. From Fig. 16-23, we see that 2y,, = 4.00 mm,
which tells us that y,, =2.00 mm.

‘We want the transverse velocity—the velocity of a
string element parallel to the y axis. To find it, we take the
time derivative of Eq. 16-67:

   

 

a
u(x, t) = aaa [(2ym sin kx) cos wt]

ot

= [-2yno sin kx] sin ot. (16-69)

Here the term sin wt provides the variation with time and
the term —2y,, sin kx provides the extent of that varia-
tion. We want the absolute magnitude of that extent:

Um = | —2yne sin kx.

To evaluate this for the element at x = 0.180 m, we first note
that y,,=2.00 mm, k=27/A=27/(0.400 m), and w=
2nf =27(806.2 Hz). Then the maximum speed of the
element at x = 0.180 m is
