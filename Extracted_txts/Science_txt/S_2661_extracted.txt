Module 16-1 Transverse Waves

“1 If a wave y(x, ) = (6.0mm) sin(kx + (600 rad/s)r + @) travels
along a string, how much time does any given point on the string take
to move between displacements y = +2.0 mm and y = —2.0mm?

°2 <= A human wave. During
sporting events within large, densely
packed stadiums, spectators will
send a wave (or pulse) around the
stadium (Fig, 16-29). As the wave
reaches a group of spectators, they
stand with a cheer and then sit. At
any instant, the width w of the wave.
is the distance from the leading edge (people are just about to stand)
to the trailing edge (people have just sat down). Suppose a human
wave travels a distance of 853 seats around a stadium in 39 s, with
spectators requiring about 1.8 s to respond to the wave’s passage by
standing and then sitting, What are (a) the wave speed v (in seats per
second) and (b) width w (in number of seats)?

*3 A wave has an angular frequency of 110 rad/s and a wave-
length of 1.80m. Calculate (a) the angular wave number and
(b) the speed of the wave.

tect the motion of a nearby beetle Z, 7,
(its prey) by the waves the motion ‘ '

16-30). The waves are of two types:
Ar

transverse waves traveling at
v, = 50 mvs and longitudinal waves
traveling at v; = 150 m/s. If a sud-
den motion sends out such waves, a
scorpion can tell the distance of the
beetle from the difference Ar in the
arrival times of the waves at its leg
nearest the beetle. If Ar=4.0 ms,
what is the beetle’s distance?

a string. The time for a particular
point to move from maximum displacement to zero is 0.170 s. What
are the (a) period and (b) frequency? (c) The wavelength is 1.40 m;

what is the wave speed?

the wave?

7 A transverse sinusoidal wave is moving along a string in the
positive direction of an x axis with a speed of 80 mis. At ¢ = 0, the
string particle at x = 0 has a transverse displacement of 4.0 cm
from its equilibrium position and is not moving. The maximum

transverse speed of the string particle at x = 0 is 16 m/s. (a) What is
the frequency of the wave? (b) What is the wavelength of the
wave? If y(x, ft) = Ym sin(kx + wt + d) is the form of the wave
equation, what are (c) Ym, (d) k, (e) @, (£) ¢, and (g) the correct
choice of sign in front of w?

verse velocity u versus time t of the
point on a string at x =0, as a wave
passes through it. The scale on the ver- t
tical axis is set by u, = 4.0 m/s. The

wave has the generic form y(x, f) =

Ymsin(kx — wt + 4). What then is 4? =

(Caution: A calculator does not always Figure 16-32 Problem 8,
give the proper inverse trig function, so
check your answer by substituting it
and an assumed value of w into y(x, t) and then plotting the function.)

ing along a string is shown
twice in Fig. 16-33, as crest A
travels in the positive direc-
tion of an x axis by distance
d=6.0cm in 4.0ms. The
tick marks along the axis are
separated by 10cm; height
H = 6.00 mm. The equation
for the wave is in the form
Y(X, t) = yy sin(kx = wt), so
what are (a) y, (b) k, (c) @, and (d) the correct choice of sign in
front of w?

10 The equation of a transverse wave traveling along a very
long string is y = 6.0 sin(0.0207x + 4.0771), where x and y are ex-
pressed in centimeters and ris in seconds. Determine (a) the ampli-
tude, (b) the wavelength, (c) the frequency, (d) the speed, (e) the
direction of propagation of the wave, and (f) the maximum trans-
verse speed of a particle in the string. (g) What is the transverse
displacement at x = 3.5 cm when t =

0.26 s? y (cm)

string in the positive direction of an -

x axis. The displacement y of the

string particle at x=0 is given in Figure 16-34 Problem 11.

set by y, = 4.0 cm. The wave equation is to be in the form
y(X, t) = Ym sin(kx + wt + ). (a) At t = 0,is a plot of y versus x in
the shape of a positive sine function or a negative sine function?
What are (b) yn, (c) k, (d) w, (e) @, (£) the sign in front of w, and (g)
the speed of the wave? (h) What is the transverse velocity of the par-
ticle at x = 0 when = 5.0 s?
