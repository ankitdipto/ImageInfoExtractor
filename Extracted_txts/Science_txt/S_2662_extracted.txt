“24 In Fig. 16-36a, string 1 has a
linear density of 3.00 g/m, and
string 2 has a linear density of 5.00
g/m. They are under tension due to
the hanging block of mass M = 500

string 1 and (b) string 2. (Hint:
When a string loops halfway
around a pulley, it pulls on the pul- (a
ley with a net force that is twice the
tension in the string.) Next the
block is divided into two blocks
(with M; + M) = M) and the appa-
ratus is rearranged as shown in

Module 16-3 Energy and Power of a Wave Traveling

Along a String

26 Astring along which waves can travel is 2.70 m long and has
a mass of 260 g. The tension in the string is 36.0 N. What must be
the frequency of traveling waves of amplitude 7.70 mm for the av-
erage power to be 85.0 W?

27 @ A sinusoidal wave is sent along a string with a linear
density of 2.0g/m. As it travels, the kinetic energies of
the mass elements along the string vary. Figure 16-37a gives the
rate dK/dt at which kinetic energy passes through the string ele-
ments at a particular instant, plotted as a function of distance x
along the string. Figure 16-37b is similar except that it gives the
rate at which kinetic energy passes through a particular mass ele-
ment (at a particular location), plotted as a function of time ¢. For
both figures, the scale on the vertical (rate) axis is set by R, = 10 W.
What is the amplitude of the wave?
