What harmonic frequency is next higher after the harmonic fre-
quency 195 Hz?

°48 <= Ifa transmission line in a cold climate collects ice, the
increased diameter tends to cause vortex formation in a passing
wind. The air pressure variations in the vortexes tend to cause the
line to oscillate (gallop), especially if the frequency of the varia-
tions matches a resonant frequency of the line. In long lines, the
resonant frequencies are so close that almost any wind speed can
set up aresonant mode vigorous enough to pull down support tow-
ers or cause the line to short out with an adjacent line. If a transmis-
sion line has a length of 347 m, a linear density of 3.35 kg/m, and a
tension of 65.2 MN, what are (a) the frequency of the fundamental
mode and (b) the frequency difference between successive modes?

standing wave on a long string, one
of the antinodes is at x = 0 and an
adjacent node is at x = 0.10 m. The
displacement y(t) of the string parti-
cle at x =0 is shown in Fig. 16-40,
where the scale of the y axis is set by

51 SSM WWW Two waves are generated on a string of length
3.0 m to produce a three-loop standing wave with an amplitude of
1.0 cm. The wave speed is 100 m/s. Let the equation for one of the
waves be of the form y(x, f) = y,, sin(kx + wf). In the equation for the
other wave, what are (a) y,,,(b) k,(c) @, and (d) the sign in front of w?

52 A rope,under a tension of 200 N and fixed at both ends, os-
cillates in a second-harmonic standing wave pattern. The displace-
ment of the rope is given by

y = (0.10 m)(sin 7x/2) sin 12,

where x = 0 at one end of the rope, x is in meters, and f is in sec-
onds. What are (a) the length of the rope, (b) the speed of the
waves on the rope, and (c) the mass of the rope? (d) If the rope os-
cillates in a third-harmonic standing wave pattern, what will be the
period of oscillation?

53 A string oscillates according to the equation

y' = (0.50 em) sol (Sem) | cos[(40m st].

What are the (a) amplitude and (b) speed of the two waves
(identical except for direction of travel) whose superposition
gives this oscillation? (c) What is the distance between nodes?

position x = 1.5 cm when t =} s?

54 © Two sinusoidal waves
with the same amplitude and
wavelength travel through each
other along a string that is
stretched along an x axis. Their
resultant wave is shown twice
in Fig, 16-41, as the antinode A
travels from an extreme up-
ward displacement to an ex-
treme downward displacement
in 6.0 ms. The tick marks along
the axis are separated by 10 cm; height H is 1.80 cm. Let the equation
for one of the two waves be of the form y(x, t) = y,, sin(kx + of). In
the equation for the other wave, what are (a) y,,, (b) k,(c) w, and (d)
the sign in front of w?

55 @ The following two waves are sent in opposite directions
on a horizontal string so as to create a standing wave in a vertical
plane:

yi(x, ) = (6.00 mm) sin(4.00 7x — 40071)

yo(x, f) = (6.00 mm) sin(4.00 7x + 4007),

with x in meters and tin seconds. An antinode is located at point A.
In the time interval that point takes to move from maximum up-
ward displacement to maximum downward displacement, how far
does each wave move along the string?

56 Astanding wave pattern on a string is described by
(x, f) = 0.040 (sin 5 7x)(cos 4071),

where x and y are in meters and ¢ is in seconds. For x = 0, what is
the location of the node with the (a) smallest, (b) second small-
est, and (c) third smallest value of x? (d) What is the period of the
oscillatory motion of any (nonnode) point? What are the (e)
speed and (f) amplitude of the two traveling waves that interfere
to produce this wave? For t = 0, what are the (g) first, (h) second,
and (i) third time that all points on the string have zero trans-
verse velocity?

57 A generator at one end of a very long string creates a wave
given by

y = (60cm) cos [(2.00 m—)x + (8.00 s~)¢],
and a generator at the other end creates the wave

y = (60cm) cos [(2.00 m~)x — (8.00 s~)4].

Calculate the (a) frequency, (b) wavelength, and (c) speed of each
wave. For x = 0, what is the location of the node having the (d)
smallest, (e) second smallest, and (f) third smallest value of x? For
x = 0, what is the location of the antinode having the (g) smallest,
(h) second smallest, and (i) third smallest value of x?
