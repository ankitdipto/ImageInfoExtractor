an aluminum wire, of
length L; =60.0 cm,
cross-sectional area 1.00
X 10-7 cm’, and density
2.60 g/cm’, is joined to a
steel wire, of density
7.80 g/cm’ and the same
cross-sectional area. The
compound wire, loaded with a block of mass m = 10.0kg, is
arranged so that the distance L> from the joint to the supporting
pulley is 86.6 cm. Transverse waves are set up on the wire by an ex-
ternal source of variable frequency; a node is located at the pulley.
(a) Find the lowest frequency that generates a standing wave hay-
ing the joint as one of the nodes. (b) How many nodes are
observed at this frequency?

60 @ In Fig. 16-42, a string, tied to a sinusoidal oscillator at P
and running over a support at Q, is stretched by a block of mass m.
The separation L between P and Q is 1.20 m, and the frequency f
of the oscillator is fixed at 120 Hz. The amplitude of the motion at
P is small enough for that point to be considered a node. A node
also exists at Q. A standing wave appears when the mass of the
hanging block is 286.1 g or 447.0 g, but not for any intermediate
mass. What is the linear density of the string?

61 @ In anexperiment on standing waves, a string 90 cm long is
attached to the prong of an electrically driven tuning fork that os-
cillates perpendicular to the length of the string at a frequency of
60 Hz. The mass of the string is 0.044 kg. What tension must the
string be under (weights are attached to the other end) if it is to os-
cillate in four loops?

71 A transverse sinusoidal wave is generated at one end of a
long, horizontal string by a bar that moves up and down through
a distance of 1.00 cm. The motion is continuous and is repeated
regularly 120 times per second. The string has linear density 120
