as the speed of sound in a medium with bulk modulus B and density p. Table 17-1
lists the speed of sound in various media.

The density of water is almost 1000 times greater than the density of air. If this
were the only relevant factor, we would expect from Eq. 17-3 that the speed of
sound in water would be considerably less than the speed of sound in air. However,
Table 17-1 shows us that the reverse is true. We conclude (again from Eq. 17-3) that
the bulk modulus of water must be more than 1000 times greater than that of air.
This is indeed the case. Water is much more incompressible than air, which (see Eq.
17-2) is another way of saying that its bulk modulus is much greater.

Formal Derivation of Eq. 17-3

‘We now derive Eq. 17-3 by direct application of Newton’s laws. Let a single
pulse in which air is compressed travel (from right to left) with speed v through the
air in a long tube, like that in Fig. 16-2. Let us run along with the pulse at that speed,
so that the pulse appears to stand still in our reference frame. Figure 17-3a
shows the situation as it is viewed from that frame. The pulse is standing still, and
air is moving at speed v through it from left to right.

Let the pressure of the undisturbed air be p and the pressure inside the
pulse be p + Ap, where Ap is positive due to the compression. Consider an element
of air of thickness Ax and face area A, moving toward the pulse at speed v. As this
element enters the pulse, the leading face of the element encounters a region of
higher pressure, which slows the element to speed v + Av, in which Av is negative.
This slowing is complete when the rear face of the element reaches the pulse, which
requires time interval

At (17-4)

Let us apply Newton’s second law to the element. During At, the average
force on the element’s trailing face is pA toward the right, and the average force
on the leading face is (p + Ap)A toward the left (Fig. 17-3b). Therefore, the
average net force on the element during Af is

F=pA—(p+ Ap)A
=—ApA (net force). (17-5)

The minus sign indicates that the net force on the air element is directed to the
left in Fig. 17-3b. The volume of the element is A Ax, so with the aid of Eq. 17-4,
we can write its mass as

Am = pAV = pA Ax = pAv At (mass). (17-6)
The average acceleration of the element during Afis

Figure 17-3 A compression pulse is sent from right to left down a long air-filled tube. The refer-
ence frame of the figure is chosen so that the pulse is at rest and the air moves from left to
right. (a) An element of air of width Ax moves toward the pulse with speed v. (b) The leading
face of the element enters the pulse. The forces acting on the leading and trailing faces (due to
air pressure) are shown.
