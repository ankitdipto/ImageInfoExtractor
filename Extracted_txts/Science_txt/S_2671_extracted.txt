CHAPTER 17 WAVES-II

Thus, from Newton’s second law (F = ma), we have, from Eqs. 17-5, 17-6,
and 17-7,

which we can write as

The air that occupies a volume V (= Av Af) outside the pulse is compressed by an
amount AV (= A Av Af) asit enters the pulse. Thus,

Substituting Eq. 17-10 and then Eq. 17-2 into Eq. 17-9 leads to

Solving for v yields Eq. 17-3 for the speed of the air toward the right in Fig. 17-3,
and thus for the actual speed of the pulse toward the left.

17.10 Sketch a graph of the pressure variation Ap(x) of an el-
ement as a function of position, and identify the amplitude

period T.

 

@ A sound wave causes a longitudinal displacement s of a
mass element in a medium as given by
S = Sm cos(kx — wt),

where 5,,, is the displacement amplitude (maximum displace-
ment) from equilibrium, k = 277/A, and w = 27f, A and fbeing
the wavelength and frequency, respectively, of the sound wave.

@ The sound wave also causes a pressure change Ap of the
medium from the equilibrium pressure:

Ap = Apm sin(kx ~ at),
where the pressure amplitude is

APn = (VP)Sin-

 

Traveling Sound Waves

Here we examine the displacements and pressure variations associated with a
sinusoidal sound wave traveling through air. Figure 17-4a displays such a wave
traveling rightward through a long air-filled tube. Recall from Chapter 16 that
we can produce such a wave by sinusoidally moving a piston at the left end of
