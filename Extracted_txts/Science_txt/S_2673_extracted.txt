Figure 17-6 (a) A plot of the displacement
function (Eq. 17-12) for t = 0. (b) A simi-
lar plot of the pressure-variation function
(Eq. 17-13). Both plots are for a 1000 Hz
sound wave whose pressure amplitude is
at the threshold of pain.

tude Ap,,, is related to the displacement amplitude s,,, in Eq. 17-12 by

AP mn = (VPO)Sm- (17-14)

Figure 17-6 shows plots of Eqs. 17-12 and 17-13 at t= 0; with time, the
two curves would move rightward along the horizontal axes. Note that the
displacement and pressure variation are 7/2 rad (or 90°) out of phase. Thus, for
example, the pressure variation Ap at any point along the wave is zero when the
displacement there is a maximum.

Vv] Checkpoint 1

When the oscillating air element in Fig 17-4b is moving rightward through the point
of zero displacement, is the pressure in the element at its equilibrium value, just be-
ginning to increase, or just beginning to decrease?

Derivation of Eqs. 17-13 and 17-14

Figure 17-45 shows an oscillating element of air of cross-sectional area A and
thickness Ax, with its center displaced from its equilibrium position by
distance s. From Eq. 17-2 we can write, for the pressure variation in the dis-
placed element,

AV
Ap = -B—_. 17-15
P Vv (17-15)
The quantity V in Eq. 17-15 is the volume of the element, given by
V=AAx. (17-16)

The quantity AV in Eq. 17-15 is the change in volume that occurs when the
element is displaced. This volume change comes about because the displace-
ments of the two faces of the element are not quite the same, differing by some
amount As. Thus, we can write the change in volume as

AV=AAs. (17-17)

Substituting Eqs. 17-16 and 17-17 into Eq. 17-15 and passing to the differen-

tial limit yield A :

The symbols @ indicate that the derivative in Eq. 17-18 is a partial derivative,
which tells us how s changes with x when the time ¢ is fixed. From Eq. 17-12 we
then have, treating fas a constant,

Os. a :
arr’ [sncos(kx — wt)] = —ks,,sin(kx — ot).

Substituting this quantity for the partial derivative in Eq. 17-18 yields

Ap = Bks,, sin(kx — ot).
This tells us that the pressure varies as a sinusoidal function of time and that the
amplitude of the variation is equal to the terms in front of the sine function.

Setting Ap, = Bks,,, this yields Eq. 17-13, which we set out to prove.
Using Eq. 17-3, we can now write

AP = (BR)Sin = (V?pK)Sin-

Equation 17-14, which we also wanted to prove, follows at once if we substitute
w/v for k from Eq. 16-12.
