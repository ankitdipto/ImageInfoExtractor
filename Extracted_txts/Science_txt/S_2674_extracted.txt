Sample Problem 17.01

The maximum pressure amplitude Ap,, that the human ear can
tolerate in loud sounds is about 28 Pa (which is very much less
than the normal air pressure of about 10° Pa). What is the dis-
placement amplitude s,,, for such a sound in air of density p =
1.21 kg/m}, at a frequency of 1000 Hz and a speed of 343 m/s?

KEY IDEA

The displacement amplitude s,,, of a sound wave is related to
the pressure amplitude Ap,,, of the wave according to Eq. 17-14.
Calculations: Solving that equation for s,, yields

That is only about one-seventh the thickness of a book page.
Obviously, the displacement amplitude of even the loudest
sound that the ear can tolerate is very small. Temporary ex-
posure to such loud sound produces temporary hearing loss,
probably due to a decrease in blood supply to the inner ear.
Prolonged exposure produces permanent damage.

The pressure amplitude Ap,, for the faintest detectable
sound at 1000Hz is 2.8 x 10> Pa. Proceeding as above
leads to s,, = 1.1 X 10! m or 11 pm, which is about one-
tenth the radius of a typical atom. The ear is indeed a sensi-
tive detector of sound waves.

Learning Objectives

 

After reading this module, you should be able to...

17.14 If two waves with the same wavelength begin in
phase but reach a common point by traveling along dif-
ferent paths, calculate their phase difference ¢ at that
point by relating the path length difference AL to the
wavelength A.

17.15 Given the phase difference between two sound

Key Ideas

@ The interference of two sound waves with identical wave-
lengths passing through a common point depends on their phase
difference ¢ there. If the sound waves were emitted in phase and
are traveling in approximately the same direction, dis given by

AL
b= 2a,

where AL is their path length difference.

@ Fully constructive interference occurs when ¢ is an integer
multiple of 277,

waves with the same amplitude, wavelength, and travel di-
rection, determine the type of interference between the
waves (fully destructive interference, fully constructive in-
terference, or indeterminate interference).

17.16 Convert a phase difference between radians, degrees,
and number of wavelengths.

¢=m(27n), form = 0,1,2,...,
and, equivalently, when AZ is related to wavelength A by
AL
TF 0,1,2,.

 

@ Fully destructive interference occurs when ¢is an odd multiple
of 7,

b= (2m + 1)z, form =0,1,2,...,
and “= 0.5,1.5,2.5,....

 

Interference

Like transverse waves, sound waves can undergo interference. In fact, we can
write equations for the interference as we did in Module 16-5 for transverse
waves. Suppose two sound waves with the same amplitude and wavelength are
traveling in the positive direction of an x axis with a phase difference of ¢. We can
express the waves in the form of Eqs. 16-47 and 16-48 but, to be consistent with

Eg. 17-12, we use cosine functions instead of sine functions:
