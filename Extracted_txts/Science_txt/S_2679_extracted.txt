Sound can cause the wall of a drinking
glass to oscillate. If the sound produces a
standing wave of oscillations and if the
intensity of the sound is large enough, the
glass will shatter.

The Decibel Scale

The displacement amplitude at the human ear ranges from about 10-° m for
the loudest tolerable sound to about 107"! m for the faintest detectable sound,
a ratio of 10°. From Eq. 17-27 we see that the intensity of a sound varies as the
square of its amplitude, so the ratio of intensities at these two limits of the hu-
man auditory system is 10'*. Humans can hear over an enormous range of
intensities.

We deal with such an enormous range of values by using logarithms.
Consider the relation

y =logx,

in which x and y are variables. It is a property of this equation that if we multiply
x by 10, then y increases by 1.To see this, we write

y’ = log(10x) = log 10 + logx =1 + y.

Similarly, if we multiply x by 10'?, y increases by only 12.
Thus, instead of speaking of the intensity J of a sound wave, it is much more
convenient to speak of its sound level £, defined as

B = (10 dB) log = (17-29)
0

Here dB is the abbreviation for decibel, the unit of sound level, a name that was
chosen to recognize the work of Alexander Graham Bell. Jp in Eq. 17-29 is a
standard reference intensity (= 10~? W/m’), chosen because it is near the lower
limit of the human range of hearing. For J = J, Eq. 17-29 gives B = 10 log 1 = 0,
so our standard reference level corresponds to zero decibels. Then # increases
by 10dB every time the sound intensity increases by an order of magnitude
(a factor of 10). Thus, 6 = 40 corresponds to an intensity that is 10* times
the standard reference level. Table 17-2 lists the sound levels for a variety of
environments.

Derivation of Eq. 17-27

Consider, in Fig. 17-4a, a thin slice of air of thickness dx, area A, and mass dm,
oscillating back and forth as the sound wave of Eq. 17-12 passes through it. The
kinetic energy dK of the slice of air is

dK =}dmv2. (17-30)
Here v, is not the speed of the wave but the speed of the oscillating element of air,

obtained from Eq. 17-12 as

os .
vy = =~ = —@S,, sin(kx — at).
ot

Using this relation and putting dm = pA dx allow us to rewrite Eq. 17-30 as
dK = 5(pA dx)(—os,,)? sin’(kx — wf). (17-31)

Dividing Eq. 17-31 by dt gives the rate at which kinetic energy moves along with
the wave. As we saw in Chapter 16 for transverse waves, dx/dt is the wave speed
v,so we have

dK

aaa 3pAvars?,, sin'(kx — wf). (17-32)
