Sample Problem 17.04 Decibels, sound level, change in intensity

Many veteran rockers suffer from acute hearing damage
because of the high sound levels they endured for years.
Many rockers now wear special earplugs to protect their
hearing during performances (Fig. 17-11). If an earplug de-
creases the sound level of the sound waves by 20 dB, what is
the ratio of the final intensity J; of the waves to their initial
intensity J;? =

KEY IDEA

For both the final and initial waves, the sound level £ is related
to the intensity by the definition of sound level in Eq. 17-29.

Calculations: For the final waves we have

= (10 dB) | ei
B= ( oe

and for the initial waves we have
8; = (10 dB) log

The difference in the sound levels is

 

 

o
B,— B; = (10 dB) (108-4 — log (17-36)
Using the identity
ae eee
log — logy = los
we can rewrite Eq. 17-36 as
i
B, — B = (10 dB) log (17-37)
:

Rearranging and then substituting the given decrease in

‘We next take the antilog of the far left and far right sides of
this equation. (Although the antilog 10-2 can be evaluated
mentally, you could use a calculator by keying in 10°-2.0 or
using the 10" key.) We find

Thus, the earplug reduces the intensity of the sound waves
to 0.010 of their initial intensity (two orders of magnitude).

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

17.24 Using standing wave patterns for string waves, sketch the
standing wave patterns for the first several acoustical harmon-
ics of a pipe with only one open end and with two open ends.

17.25 For a standing wave of sound, relate the distance
between nodes and the wavelength.

Key Ideas

@ Standing sound wave patterns can be set up in pipes (that

is, resonance can be set up) if sound of the proper wave-

length is introduced in the pipe.

@ A pipe open at both ends will resonate at frequencies

17.26 Identify which type of pipe has even harmonics.

17.27 For any given harmonic and for a pipe with only one open
end or with two open ends, apply the relationships between
the pipe length L, the speed of sound v, the wavelength A, the
harmonic frequency f, and the harmonic number n.

where v is the speed of sound in the air in the pipe.

@ For a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the

resonant frequencies are
