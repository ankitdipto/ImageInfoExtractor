open end, as required. There is also a node across the middle of the pipe. An
easier way of representing this standing longitudinal sound wave is shown in
Fig. 17-13b—by drawing it as a standing transverse string wave.

The standing wave pattern of Fig. 17-13a is called the fundamental mode or
first harmonic. For it to be set up, the sound waves in a pipe of length L must
have a wavelength given by L = N/2, so that A = 2L. Several more standing
sound wave patterns for a pipe with two open ends are shown in Fig. 17-14a
using string wave representations. The second harmonic requires sound waves of
wavelength A = L, the third harmonic requires wavelength A = 2L/3, and so on.

More generally, the resonant frequencies for a pipe of length L with two
open ends correspond to the wavelengths

where nis called the harmonic number. Letting v be the speed of sound, we write
the resonant frequencies for a pipe with two open ends as

One Open End. Figure 17-14b shows (using string wave representations)
some of the standing sound wave patterns that can be set up in a pipe with only
one open end. As required, across the open end there is an antinode and across
the closed end there is a node. The simplest pattern requires sound waves hav-
ing a wavelength given by L = A/4,so that A = 4L. The next simplest pattern re-
quires a wavelength given by L = 3A/4,so that A = 4L/3, and so on.

More generally, the resonant frequencies for a pipe of length L with only
one open end correspond to the wavelengths

A= a forn = 1,3,5,..., (17-40)
in which the harmonic number n must be an odd number. The resonant frequen-
cies are then given by

fe = = a forn =1,3,5,... (pipeoneopenend). (17-41)

Note again that only odd harmonics can exist in a pipe with one open end. For
example, the second harmonic, with n = 2, cannot be set up in such a pipe.
Note also that for such a pipe the adjective in a phrase such as “the third har-
monic” still refers to the harmonic number n (and not to, say, the third possible
harmonic). Finally note that Eqs. 17-38 and 17-39 for two open ends contain the
