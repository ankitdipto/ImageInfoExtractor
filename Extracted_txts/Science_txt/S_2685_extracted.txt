496 CHAPTER 17 WAVES-II

17-41 gives the harmonic frequencies in a pipe with only
one open end (an asymmetric pipe) as f = nv/4L, for n =
1,3,5,...,that is, for only odd positive integers.

Pipe A: Let’s first find the resonant frequencies of symmet-
ric pipe A (with two open ends) by evaluating Eq. 17-39:

 

re nav _ na(343 m/s)
A 2L,  2(0.343m)

= n4(500 Hz) = n4(0.50 kHz), forn, = 1,2,3,....

The first six harmonic frequencies are shown in the top plot
in Fig. 17-17.

Pipe B: Next let’s find the resonant frequencies of asym-
metric pipe B (with only one open end) by evaluating Eq.
17-41, being careful to use only odd integers for the har-
monic numbers:

ae Nv _ nv. __n(343 mis)
® GL, 4(0.500L,) 2(0.343 m)

= ny(500 Hz) = ng(0.500 kHz),

 

forng = 1,3,5,....

Comparing our two results, we see that we get a match for
each choice of ng:

fa=fg forna=ng (Answer)

For example, as shown in Fig. 17-17, if we set up the fifth
harmonic in pipe B and bring the pipe close to pipe A, the
fifth harmonic will then be set up in pipe A. However, no
harmonic in B can set up an even harmonic in A.

with ng = 1,3,5,....

Pipe C: Let’s continue with pipe C (with only one end) by
writing Eq. 17-41 as

WILEY

Nv Nev nc (343 m/s)
fe = at

~4Le 4(0250L,) 0.343 mis
= nc (1000 Hz) = nc (1.00kHz), forme = 1,3,5,....

 

From this we see that C can excite some of the harmonics of
A but only those with harmonic numbers nz, that are twice
an odd integer:

fa=fe forng =2ne,
Pipe D: Finally, let’s check D with our same procedure:

he NpV __ MpV_____ Np (343 mis)
>“ 4Lp  4(2L,) _8(0.343 mis)
= np (125 Hz) = np (0.125 kHz),

with nc = 1,3,5,.... (Answer)

 

 

for np = 1,3,5,....

As shown in Fig. 17-17, none of these frequencies match a
harmonic frequency of A. (Can you see that we would get a
match if np = 4n,4? But that is impossible because 4n 4 can-
not yield an odd integer, as required of np.) Thus D cannot
set up a standing wave in A.

17-6 Beats

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

17.28 Explain how beats are produced.

17.29 Add the displacement equations for two sound
waves of the same amplitude and slightly different angu-
lar frequencies to find the displacement equation of the
resultant wave and identify the time-varying amplitude.

Key Idea

17.30 Apply the relationship between the beat frequency
and the frequencies of two sound waves that have the
same amplitude when the frequencies (or, equivalently,
the angular frequencies) differ by a small amount.

 

@ Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, f, and /5, are detected together. The beat frequency is
