Beats

If we listen, a few minutes apart, to two sounds whose frequencies are, say, 552
and 564 Hz, most of us cannot tell one from the other because the frequencies are
so close to each other. However, if the sounds reach our ears simultaneously,
what we hear is a sound whose frequency is 558 Hz, the average of the two com-
bining frequencies. We also hear a striking variation in the intensity of this
sound— it increases and decreases in slow, wavering beats that repeat at a fre-
quency of 12 Hz, the difference between the two combining frequencies. Figure
17-18 shows this beat phenomenon.

Let the time-dependent variations of the displacements due to two sound
waves of equal amplitude s,,, be

Sy} = Sm COS yt and 57 = Sp COS wnt, (17-42)

where «, > @. From the superposition principle, the resultant displacement is the
sum of the individual displacements:

5 =S1 +S) = 5,,(COS at + COS wnt).
Using the trigonometric identity (see Appendix E)
cos a + cos B = 2 cos[3(a — B)] cos[}(a + B)]
allows us to write the resultant displacement as
5 = 25,,c0s[}(« — w2)] cos[3(w + w2)t]. (17-43)
Tf we write
wo! = x(@,— @) and w= }(@, + &), (17-44)

we can then write Eq. 17-43 as
5(t) = [25 Cos w't] cos wt. (17-45)

‘We now assume that the angular frequencies w, and w) of the combining
waves are almost equal, which means that w > ow’ in Eq. 17-44. We can then
regard Eq. 17-45 as a cosine function whose angular frequency is # and whose
amplitude (which is not constant but varies with angular frequency @') is the
absolute value of the quantity in the brackets.

A maximum amplitude will occur whenever cos w't in Eq. 17-45 has the
value +1 or —1, which happens twice in each repetition of the cosine function.
Because cos w’t has angular frequency w’, the angular frequency @.a at which
beats occur is @pea; = 2w'. Then, with the aid of Eq. 17-44, we can write the beat
angular frequency as

peat = 20! = (2)(G)(@1 — @) = @ —

Because w = 27f, we can recast this as

foeat = fifo (beat frequency). (17-46)

Musicians use the beat phenomenon in tuning instruments. If an instrument is
sounded against a standard frequency (for example, the note called “concert A”
played on an orchestra’s first oboe) and tuned until the beat disappears, the instru-
ment is in tune with that standard. In musical Vienna, concert A (440 Hz) is avail-
able as a convenient telephone service for the city’s many musicians.
