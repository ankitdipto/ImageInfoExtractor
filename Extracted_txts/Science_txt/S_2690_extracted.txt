17-7 THE DOPPLER EFFECT

Shift up: The source moves
toward the detector.

Figure 17-22 A detector D is stationary,
and a source S is moving toward it at
speed vs. Wavefront W, was emitted
when the source was at S;, wavefront
W, when it was at S;. At the moment
depicted, the source is at S. The
detector senses a higher frequency
because the moving source, chasing
its own wavefronts, emits a reduced.

motion.

Source Moving, Detector Stationary

Let detector D be stationary with respect to the body of air, and let source S
move toward D at speed vs (Fig. 17-22). The motion of S changes the wavelength
of the sound waves it emits and thus the frequency detected by D.

To see this change, let T (= 1/f) be the time between the emission of any
pair of successive wavefronts W,; and W). During T, wavefront W, moves a dis-
tance vT and the source moves a distance vsT. At the end of T, wavefront W, is
emitted. In the direction in which S moves, the distance between W, and W), which
is the wavelength A’ of the waves moving in that direction, is vT — vsT.If D detects
those waves, it detects frequency f’ given by

Note that f’ must be greater than f unless vs = 0.
In the direction opposite that taken by S, the wavelength A’ of the waves is

again the distance between successive waves but now that distance is vT + vsT. If

D detects those waves, it detects frequency f’ given by

Now f' must be less than f unless vs = 0.
‘We can summarize Eqs. 17-53 and 17-54 with
f =f view (source moving, detector stationary). (17-55)

General Doppler Effect Equation

‘We can now derive the general Doppler effect equation by replacing f in
Eq. 17-55 (the source frequency) with f’ of Eq. 17-52 (the frequency associated
with motion of the detector). That simple replacement gives us Eq. 17-47 for the
general Doppler effect. That general equation holds not only when both detector
and source are moving but also in the two specific situations we just discussed.
For the situation in which the detector is moving and the source is stationary, sub-
stitution of vs = 0 into Eq. 17-47 gives us Eq. 17-52, which we previously found.
For the situation in which the source is moving and the detector is stationary,
substitution of vp = 0 into Eq. 17-47 gives us Eq. 17-55, which we previously
found. Thus, Eq. 17-47 is the equation to remember.
