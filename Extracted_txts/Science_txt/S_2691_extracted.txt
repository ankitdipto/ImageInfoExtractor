Sample Problem 17.07 Double Doppler shift in the echoes used by bats

Bats navigate and search out prey by emitting, and then de-
tecting reflections of, ultrasonic waves, which are sound
waves with frequencies greater than can be heard by a hu-
man. Suppose a bat emits ultrasound at frequency f,, = 82.52
kHz while flying with velocity yj, = (9.00 m/s)i as it chases a
moth that flies with velocity V,, = (8.00 m/s)i. What fre-
quency f;,,; does the moth detect? What frequency fj,; does the
bat detect in the returning echo from the moth? ee

KEY IDEAS

 

The frequency is shifted by the relative motion of the bat and
moth. Because they move along a single axis, the shifted fre-
quency is given by Eq. 17-47. Motion toward tends to shift the
frequency up, and motion away tends to shift it down.

Detection by moth: The general Doppler equation is

as (17-56)
Here, the detected frequency f’ that we want to find is the fre-
quency f,,q detected by the moth. On the right side, the emitted
frequency fis the bat’s emission frequency fj, = 82.52 kHz, the
speed of sound is v = 343 m/s, the speed Vp of the detector is
the moth’s speed v,,=8.00 m/s, and the speed vs of the
source is the bat’s speed v,, = 9.00 m/s.

The decisions about the plus and minus signs can be
tricky. Think in terms of toward and away. We have the
speed of the moth (the detector) in the numerator of
Eq. 17-56. The moth moves away from the bat, which tends
to lower the detected frequency. Because the speed is in the

numerator, we choose the minus sign to meet that tendency
(the numerator becomes smaller). These reasoning steps
are shown in Table 17-3.

‘We have the speed of the bat in the denominator of
Eg. 17-56. The bat moves toward the moth, which tends to
increase the detected frequency. Because the speed is in the
denominator, we choose the minus sign to meet that ten-
dency (the denominator becomes smaller).

With these substitutions and decisions, we have

343 m/s — 9.00 m/s

= 82.767 kHz ~ 82.8 kHz. (Answer)

Detection of echo by bat: In the echo back to the bat, the
moth acts as a source of sound, emitting at the frequency fing
we just calculated. So now the moth is the source (moving
away) and the bat is the detector (moving toward). The rea-
soning steps are shown in Table 17-3. To find the frequency
fia detected by the bat, we write Eq. 17-56 as

Soa = fay

343 m/s + 9.00 m/s
343 m/s + 8.00 m/s

= 83.00 kHz ~ 83.0 kHz.

= (82.767 kHz)

(Answer)

Some moths evade bats by “jamming” the detection system
with ultrasonic clicks.
