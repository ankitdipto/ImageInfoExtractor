path taken by a sound wave of a single frequency traveling at 343
m/s through air with a uniform density of 1.21 kg/m’. The vertical
axis scale is set by Ap, = 4.0 mPa. If the displacement function of the
wave is s(x, f) =5,, cos(kx — wf), what are (a) 5,,, (b) k, and (c) w?
The air is then cooled so that its density is 1.35 kg/m’ and the speed
of a sound wave through it is 320 m/s. The sound source again emits
the sound wave at the same frequency and same pressure ampli-
tude. What now are (d) 5, (e) k,and (£) 0?

0°15 @ <M A handclap on stage in an amphitheater sends out
sound waves that scatter from terraces of width w = 0.75 m
(Fig. 17-33). The sound returns to the stage as a periodic
series of pulses, one from each terrace; the parade of pulses
sounds like a played note. (a) Assuming that all the rays in
Fig, 17-33 are horizontal, find the frequency at which the pulses
return (that is, the frequency of the perceived note). (b) If the
width w of the terraces were smaller, would the frequency be
higher or lower?

*16 Two sound waves, from two different sources with the same
frequency, 540 Hz, travel in the same direction at 330 m/s. The
sources are in phase. What is the phase difference of the waves at
a point that is 440m from one source and 4.00m from the
other?

°°17 ILW <= Two loud speakers are located 3.35 m apart on an
outdoor stage. A listener is 18.3 m from one and 19.5 m from the
other. During the sound check, a signal generator drives the two
speakers in phase with the same amplitude and frequency.
The transmitted frequency is swept through the audible range
(20 Hz to 20 kHz). (a) What is the lowest frequency fixin,1 that gives
minimum signal (destructive interference) at the listener’s loca-
tion? By what number must f,,;,; be multiplied to get (b) the sec-
ond lowest frequency fyin> that gives minimum signal and (c) the
third lowest frequency fy;,,3 that gives minimum signal? (d) What is
the lowest frequency f,,,. that gives maximum signal (constructive
interference) at the listener's location? By what number must finax.1
be multiplied to get (e) the second lowest frequency finax2 that
gives maximum signal and (f) the third lowest frequency fina. 3 that
gives maximum signal?

18 @ InFig. 17-34,sound waves A
and B, both of wavelength A, are ini-
tially in phase and traveling right-
ward, as indicated by the two rays.
Wave A is reflected from four sur-
faces but ends up traveling in its orig-
inal direction. Wave B ends in that di-
rection after reflecting from two
surfaces. Let distance L in the figure
be expressed as a multiple q of A: L =

and S,. The sources emit waves in
phase at wavelength 0.50 m; they are
separated by D = 1.75 m. If we move a sound detector along a large
circle centered at the midpoint between the sources, at how many
points do waves arrive at the detector (a) exactly in phase and (b) ex-
actly out of phase?

20 Figure 17-36 shows four isotropic point sources of sound
that are uniformly spaced on an x axis. The sources emit sound at
the same wavelength A and same amplitude s,,, and they emit in
phase. A point P is shown on the x axis. Assume that as the sound
waves travel to P, the decrease in their amplitude is negligible.
What multiple of s,, is the amplitude of the net wave at P if dis-
tance din the figure is (a) /4, (b) A/2,and (c) A?

22 In Fig. 17-38, sound with a
40.0cm wavelength travels right-
ward from a source and through a
tube that consists of a straight por-
tion and a half-circle. Part of the
sound wave travels through the half-
circle and then rejoins the rest of the
wave, which goes directly through
the straight portion. This rejoining
results in interference. What is the
smallest radius r that results in an in-
tensity minimum at the detector?
