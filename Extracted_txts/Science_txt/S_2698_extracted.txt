°40 Organ pipe A, with both ends open, has a fundamental
frequency of 300 Hz. The third harmonic of organ pipe B, with
one end open, has the same frequency as the second harmonic of
pipe A. How long are (a) pipe A and (b) pipe B?

°41 A violin string 15.0 cm long and fixed at both ends oscillates
in its m = 1 mode. The speed of waves on the string is 250 m/s, and
the speed of sound in air is 348 m/s. What are the (a) frequency and
(b) wavelength of the emitted sound wave?

°42 A sound wave in a fluid medium is reflected at a barrier so
that a standing wave is formed. The distance between nodes is
3.8cm, and the speed of propagation is 1500 m/s. Find the fre-
quency of the sound wave.

*43 SSM In Fig, 17-41, S is a small loudspeaker q
driven by an audio oscillator with a frequency that

is varied from 1000 Hz to 2000 Hz, and D isa cylin- D
drical pipe with two open ends and a length of
45.7 cm. The speed of sound in the air-filled pipe is
344 ns. (a) At how many frequencies does the
sound from the loudspeaker set up resonance in
the pipe? What are the (b) lowest and (c) second
lowest frequencies at which resonance occurs?

°44 <= The crest of a Parasaurolophus dinosaur skull is shaped
somewhat like a trombone and contains a nasal passage in the
form of a long, bent tube open at both ends. The dinosaur may
have used the passage to produce sound by setting up the funda-
mental mode in it. (a) If the nasal passage in a certain
Parasaurolophus fossil is 2.0 m long, what frequency would have
been produced? (b) If that dinosaur could be recreated (as in
Jurassic Park), would a person with a hearing range of 60 Hz to
20 kHz be able to hear that fundamental mode and, if so, would the
sound be high or low frequency? Fossil skulls that contain shorter
nasal passages are thought to be those of the female
Parasaurolophus. (c) Would that make the female’s fundamental
frequency higher or lower than the male’s?

Problem 43.

°45 In pipe A, the ratio of a particular harmonic frequency to the
next lower harmonic frequency is 1.2. In pipe B, the ratio of a par-
ticular harmonic frequency to the next lower harmonic frequency
is 1.4. How many open ends are in (a) pipe A and (b) pipe B?

46 @ Pipe A, which is 1.20m long and open at both ends,
oscillates at its third lowest harmonic frequency. It is filled with air
for which the speed of sound is 343 m/s. Pipe B, which is closed at
one end, oscillates at its second lowest harmonic frequency. This
frequency of B happens to match the frequency of A. An x axis ex-
tends along the interior of B, with x = 0 at the closed end. (a) How
many nodes are along that axis? What are the (b) smallest and
(c) second smallest value of x locating those nodes? (d) What is the
fundamental frequency of B?

°°47 A well with vertical sides and water at the bottom resonates
at 7.00 Hz and at no lower frequency. The air-filled portion of the
well acts as a tube with one closed end (at the bottom) and one
open end (at the top). The air in the well has a density of 1.10 kg/m?
and a bulk modulus of 1.33 X 10° Pa. How far down in the well is
the water surface?

harmonic? One of the harmonic frequencies of tube B with only

1320 Hz. (c) What harmonic frequency is next highest after the
harmonic frequency 600 Hz? (d) What is the number of this next-
highest harmonic?

#49 ssM A violin string 30.0cm long with linear density
0.650 g/m is placed near a loudspeaker that is fed by an audio oscil-
lator of variable frequency. It is found that the string is set into os-
cillation only at the frequencies 880 and 1320 Hz as the frequency
of the oscillator is varied over the range 500-1500 Hz. What is the
tension in the string?

50 @ A tube 1.20 m long is closed at one end. A stretched wire
is placed near the open end. The wire is 0.330 m long and has a
mass of 9.60 g. It is fixed at both ends and oscillates in its funda-
mental mode. By resonance, it sets the air column in the tube into
oscillation at that column’s fundamental frequency. Find (a) that
frequency and (b) the tension in the wire.

°51 The A string of a violin is a little too tightly stretched. Beats
at 4.00 per second are heard when the string is sounded together
with a tuning fork that is oscillating accurately at concert A
(440 Hz). What is the period of the violin string oscillation?

52 A tuning fork of unknown frequency makes 3.00 beats per
second with a standard fork of frequency 384 Hz. The beat fre-
quency decreases when a small piece of wax is put on a prong of
the first fork. What is the frequency of this fork?

53 ssm Two identical piano wires have a fundamental
frequency of 600 Hz when kept under the same tension. What frac-
tional increase in the tension of one wire will lead to the occur-
rence of 6.0 beats/s when both wires oscillate simultaneously?

54 You have five tuning forks that oscillate at close but differ-
ent resonant frequencies. What are the (a) maximum and (b) mini-
mum number of different beat frequencies you can produce by
sounding the forks two at a time, depending on how the resonant
frequencies differ?

60.0 cm at an angular speed of 15.0 rad/s. What are the (a) lowest
and (b) highest frequencies heard by a listener a long distance
away, at rest with respect to the center of the circle?

takes and passes a cyclist pedaling a bike at 2.44 m/s. After being
passed, the cyclist hears a frequency of 1590 Hz. How fast is the
ambulance moving?

29.9 m/s, the speed of surface B is 65.8 m/s, and the speed of sound
is 329 m/s. The source emits waves at frequency 1200 Hz as meas-
ured in the source frame. In the reflector frame, what are the
(a) frequency and (b) wavelength of the arriving sound waves? In
the source frame, what are the (c) frequency and (d) wavelength of
the sound waves reflected back to the source?
