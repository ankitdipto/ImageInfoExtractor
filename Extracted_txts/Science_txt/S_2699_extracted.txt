510 CHAPTER 17 WAVES-II

59 © In Fig. 17-42, a French submarine and a U.S. submarine
move toward each other during maneuvers in motionless water
in the North Atlantic. The French sub moves at speed vp =
50.00 kn/h, and the U.S. sub at vys = 70.00 km/h. The French sub
sends out a sonar signal (sound wave in water) at 1.000 X 10° Hz.
Sonar waves travel at 5470 km/h. (a) What is the signal’s frequency
as detected by the U.S. sub? (b) What frequency is detected by the
French sub in the signal reflected back to it by the U.S. sub?

60 Astationary motion detector sends sound waves of frequency
0.150 MHz toward a truck approaching at a speed of 45.0 m/s. What
is the frequency of the waves reflected back to the detector?

61 © <= A bat is flitting about in a cave, navigating via
ultrasonic bleeps. Assume that the sound emission frequency of the
bat is 39 000 Hz. During one fast swoop directly toward a flat wall
surface, the bat is moving at 0.025 times the speed of sound in air.
What frequency does the bat hear reflected off the wall?

62 Figure 17-43 shows four tubes with lengths 1.0 m or 2.0 m,
with one or two open ends as drawn. The third harmonic is set up in
each tube, and some of the sound that escapes from them is detected
by detector D, which moves directly away from the tubes. In
terms of the speed of sound v,

tube’s fundamental frequency?

63 iw An acoustic burglar alarm consists of a source emitting
waves of frequency 28.0 kHz. What is the beat frequency between
the source waves and the waves reflected from an intruder walking
at an average speed of 0.950 mis directly away from the alarm?

64 A stationary detector measures the frequency of a sound
source that first moves at constant velocity directly toward the de-
tector and then (after passing the detector) directly away from it.
The emitted frequency is f, During the approach the detected fre-
quency is f’ypp and during the recession it is f'ec. If (Fapp — fres)/f =
0.500, what is the ratio v,/v of the speed of the source to the speed
of sound?

+65 @ A 2000 Hz siren and a civil defense official are both at
rest with respect to the ground. What frequency does the official
hear if the wind is blowing at 12 m/s (a) from source to official and
(b) from official to source?

66 @ Two trains are traveling toward each other at 30.5 m/s
relative to the ground. One train is blowing a whistle at 500 Hz.
(a) What frequency is heard on the other train in still air? (b) What
frequency is heard on the other train if the wind is blowing at
30.5 m/s toward the whistle and away from the listener? (c) What
frequency is heard if the wind direction is reversed?

67 ssM www A girl is sitting near the open window of a
train that is moving at a velocity of 10.00 m/s to the east. The girl’s
uncle stands near the tracks and watches the train move away. The

locomotive whistle emits sound at frequency 500.0 Hz. The air is
still. (a) What frequency does the uncle hear? (b) What frequency
does the girl hear? A wind begins to blow from the east at 10.00
m/s. (c) What frequency does the uncle now hear? (d) What fre-
quency does the girl now hear?

Module 17-8 Supersonic Speeds, Shock Waves

°68 The shock wave off the cockpit of the FA 18 in Fig. 17-24
has an angle of about 60°. The airplane was traveling at about
1350 km/h when the photograph was taken. Approximately what
was the speed of sound at the airplane’s altitude?

69 SSM = A jet plane passes over you at a height of 5000 m
and a speed of Mach 1.5. (a) Find the Mach cone angle (the sound
speed is 331 m/s). (b) How long after the jet passes directly over-
head does the shock wave reach you?

70 Aplane flies at 1.25 times the speed of sound. Its sonic boom
reaches a man on the ground 1.00 min after the plane passes di-
rectly overhead. What is the altitude of the plane? Assume the
speed of sound to be 330 mis.

Additional Problems

71 At a distance of 10km, a 100 Hz horn, assumed to be an
isotropic point source, is barely audible. At what distance would it
begin to cause pain?

72 A bullet is fired with a speed of 685 m/s. Find the angle made
by the shock cone with the line of motion of the bullet.

73 <= A sperm whale (Fig. 17-44a) vocalizes by producing a
series of clicks. Actually, the whale makes only a single sound near
the front of its head to start the series. Part of that sound then
emerges from the head into the water to become the first click of
the series. The rest of the sound travels backward through the
spermaceti sac (a body of fat), reflects from the frontal sac (an air
layer), and then travels forward through the spermaceti sac. When
it reaches the distal sac (another air layer) at the front of the head,
some of the sound escapes into the water to form the second click,
and the rest is sent back through the spermaceti sac (and ends up
forming later clicks).

Figure 17-44b shows a strip-chart recording of a series of clicks.
A unit time interval of 1.0 ms is indicated on the chart. Assuming
that the speed of sound in the spermaceti sac is 1372 m/s, find
the length of the spermaceti sac. From such a calculation, marine
scientists estimate the length of a whale from its click series.
