100 Pipe A has only one open end; pipe B is four times as long
and has two open ends. Of the lowest 10 harmonic numbers ny of
pipe B, what are the (a) smallest, (b) second smallest, and (c) third
smallest values at which a harmonic frequency of B matches one of
the harmonic frequencies of A?

101 A pipe 0.60 m long and closed at one end is filled with an
unknown gas. The third lowest harmonic frequency for the pipe is
750 Hz. (a) What is the speed of sound in the unknown gas?
(b) What is the fundamental frequency for this pipe when itis filled
with the unknown gas?

102 A sound wave travels out uniformly in all directions from a
point source. (a) Justify the following expression for the displace-
ment s of the transmitting medium at any distance r from the source:

db.
s=—sin k(r — vt),

where b is a constant. Consider the speed, direction of propaga-
tion, periodicity, and intensity of the wave. (b) What is the dimen-
sion of the constant b?

103 A police car is chasing a speeding Porsche 911. Assume that
the Porsche’s maximum speed is 80.0 m/s and the police car’s is 54.0
m/s. At the moment both cars reach their maximum speed, what fre-
quency will the Porsche driver hear if the frequency of the police
car’s siren is 440 Hz? Take the speed of sound in air to be 340 m/s.

104 Suppose a spherical loudspeaker emits sound isotropically at
10 W into a room with completely absorbent walls, floor, and ceiling,
(an anechoic chamber). (a) What is the intensity of the sound at
distance d = 3.0 m from the center of the source? (b) What is the
ratio of the wave amplitude at d = 4.0 m to that at d = 3.0 m?

105 In Fig. 17-35, S; and S are two isotropic point sources of
sound. They emit waves in phase at wavelength 0.50 m; they are
separated by D = 1.60 m. If we move a sound detector along a
large circle centered at the midpoint between the sources, at how
many points do waves arrive at the detector (a) exactly in phase
and (b) exactly out of phase?

106 Figure 17-50 shows a transmitter and receiver of waves con-
tained in a single instrument. It is used to measure the speed u of a
target object (idealized as a flat plate) that is moving directly to-
ward the unit, by analyzing the waves reflected from the target.
What is wif the emitted frequency is 18.0 kHz and the detected fre-
quency (of the returning waves) is 22.2 kHz?

plunger P is provided at the other end of the tube, and the tube is
filled with a gas. The rod is made to oscillate longitudinally at fre-
quency f to produce sound waves inside the gas, and the location
of the plunger is adjusted until a standing sound wave pattern is
set up inside the tube. Once the standing wave is set up, the mo-
tion of the gas molecules causes the cork filings to collect in a
pattern of ridges at the displacement nodes. If f = 4.46 x 10° Hz
and the separation between ridges is 9.20 cm, what is the speed of
sound in the gas?

108 A source S and a detector D of radio waves are a distance d
apart on level ground (Fig. 17-52). Radio waves of wavelength A
reach D either along a straight path or by reflecting (bouncing)
from a certain layer in the atmosphere. When the layer is at height
H, the two waves reaching D are exactly in phase. If the layer grad-
ually rises, the phase difference between the two waves gradually
shifts, until they are exactly out of phase when the layer is at height
H +h. Express A in terms of d,h, and H.

109 In Fig. 17-53, a point source S of sound waves lies near a
reflecting wall AB. A sound detector D intercepts sound ray R;
traveling directly from S. It also intercepts sound ray R, that re-
flects from the wall such that the angle of incidence @, is equal to
the angle of reflection 6,. Assume that the reflection of sound by
the wall causes a phase shift of 0.500A. If the distances are d, =
2.50 m, dy = 20.0 m, and d; = 12.5 m, what are the (a) lowest and
(b) second lowest frequency at which R; and R> are in phase at D?

The car is moving toward a wall at 20.0 m/s. Find the sound fre-
quency (a) at the wall and (b) reflected back to the trumpeter.

111 A listener at rest (with respect to the air and the ground)
hears a signal of frequency f; from a source moving toward him
with a velocity of 15 m/s, due east. If the listener then moves toward
the approaching source with a velocity of 25 m/s, due west, he hears
a frequency f, that differs from f, by 37 Hz. What is the frequency of
the source? (Take the speed of sound in air to be 340 m/s.)
