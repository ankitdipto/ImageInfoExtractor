Key Idea
@ The Celsius temperature scale is defined by
To = T — 273.15°,

with Tin kelvins. The Fahrenheit temperature scale is defined by
Ty = 3Tp + 32°.

The Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales

So far, we have discussed only the Kelvin scale, used in basic scientific work. In
nearly all countries of the world, the Celsius scale (formerly called the centigrade
scale) is the scale of choice for popular and commercial use and much scientific
use. Celsius temperatures are measured in degrees, and the Celsius degree has
the same size as the kelvin. However, the zero of the Celsius scale is shifted to a
more convenient value than absolute zero. If Tc represents a Celsius temperature
and T a Kelvin temperature, then

Te = T —273.15°. (18-7)

In expressing temperatures on the Celsius scale, the degree symbol is commonly
used. Thus, we write 20.00°C for a Celsius reading but 293.15 K for a Kelvin
reading.

The Fahrenheit scale, used in the United States, employs a smaller degree than
the Celsius scale and a different zero of temperature. You can easily verify both
these differences by examining an ordinary room thermometer on which both scales
are marked. The relation between the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales is

Ty = 3To + 32%, (18-8)

where T; is Fahrenheit temperature. Converting between these two scales can be
done easily by remembering a few corresponding points, such as the freezing and
boiling points of water (Table 18-1). Figure 18-7 compares the Kelvin, Celsius,
and Fahrenheit scales.

Table 18-1 Some Corresponding Temperatures

Temperature °C °F
Boiling point of water# 100 212
Normal body temperature 37.0 98.6
Accepted comfort level 20 68
Freezing point of water’ 0 32
Zero of Fahrenheit scale ~—18 0
Scales coincide —40 —40

“Strictly, the boiling point of water on the Celsius scale is 99.975°C,
and the freezing point is 0,00°C. Thus, there is slightly less than 100 C?
between those two points.
