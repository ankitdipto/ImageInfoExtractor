18-2 THE CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT SCALES

519

We use the letters C and F to distinguish measurements and degrees on the

two scales. Thus,
O°C = 32°F

means that 0° on the Celsius scale measures the same temperature as 32° on the

Fahrenheit scale, whereas
5C=9F

means that a temperature difference of 5 Celsius degrees (note the degree sym-
bol appears after C) is equivalent to a temperature difference of 9 Fahrenheit

degrees.

Sample Problem 18.01 Conversion between two temperature scales

Suppose you come across old scientific notes that describe
a temperature scale called Z on which the boiling point of
water is 65.0°Z and the freezing point is —14.0°Z. To what
temperature on the Fahrenheit scale would a temperature
of T = —98.0°Z correspond? Assume that the Z scale is
linear; that is, the size of a Z degree is the same everywhere
on the Z scale.

KEY IDEA

 

A conversion factor between two (linear) temperature
scales can be calculated by using two known (benchmark)
temperatures, such as the boiling and freezing points of wa-
ter. The number of degrees between the known tempera-
tures on one scale is equivalent to the number of degrees
between them on the other scale.

Calculations: We begin by relating the given temperature
T to either known temperature on the Z scale. Since T =
—98.0°Z is closer to the freezing point (—14.0°Z) than to the
boiling point (65.0°Z), we use the freezing point. Then we
note that the T we seek is below this point by —14.0°Z —
(—98.0°Z) = 84.0 Z° (Fig. 18-8). (Read this difference as
“84.0 Z degrees.”)

Next, we set up a conversion factor between the Z
and Fahrenheit scales to convert this difference. To do so,
we use both known temperatures on the Z scale and the

corresponding temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale. On the
Z scale, the difference between the boiling and freezing
points is 65.0°Z — (—14.0°Z) = 79.0 Z°. On the Fahrenheit
scale, it is 212°F — 32.0°F = 180 F°. Thus, a temperature dif-
ference of 79.0 Z° is equivalent to a temperature difference of
180 F° (Fig. 18-8), and we can use the ratio (180 F°)/(79.0 Z°)
as our conversion factor.

Now, since T is below the freezing point by 84.0 Z’, it
must also be below the freezing point by

Because the freezing point is at 32.0°F, this means that

T = 32.0°F — 191 F = —159°F, (Answer)
