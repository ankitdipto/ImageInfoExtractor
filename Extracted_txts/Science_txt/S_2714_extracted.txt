18-4 ABSORPTION OF HEAT

From the way the calorie and the British thermal unit were initially defined,
the specific heat of water is

c= Lcal/g:C? = 1 Btu/lb-F° = 4186.8 J/kg-K. (18-15)

Table 18-3 shows the specific heats of some substances at room temperature.
Note that the value for water is relatively high. The specific heat of any substance
actually depends somewhat on temperature, but the values in Table 18-3 apply
reasonably well in a range of temperatures near room temperature.

A certain amount of heat Q will warm 1 g of material A by 3 C? and 1 g of material B
by 4 ©. Which material has the greater specific heat?

Molar Specific Heat

In many instances the most convenient unit for specifying the amount of a
substance is the mole (mol), where

1 mol = 6.02 x 10” elementary units

of any substance. Thus 1 mol of aluminum means 6.02 x 10” atoms (the atom is
the elementary unit), and 1 mol of aluminum oxide means 6.02 x 107 molecules
(the molecule is the elementary unit of the compound).

When quantities are expressed in moles, specific heats must also involve
moles (rather than a mass unit); they are then called molar specific heats.
Table 18-3 shows the values for some elemental solids (each consisting of a single
element) at room temperature.

An Important Point

In determining and then using the specific heat of any substance, we need to
know the conditions under which energy is transferred as heat. For solids and
liquids, we usually assume that the sample is under constant pressure (usually
atmospheric) during the transfer. It is also conceivable that the sample is held at
constant volume while the heat is absorbed. This means that thermal expansion
of the sample is prevented by applying external pressure. For solids and liquids,
this is very hard to arrange experimentally, but the effect can be calculated, and it
turns out that the specific heats under constant pressure and constant volume for
any solid or liquid differ usually by no more than a few percent. Gases, as you will
see, have quite different values for their specific heats under constant-pressure
conditions and under constant-volume conditions.

Heats of Transformation

When energy is absorbed as heat by a solid or liquid, the temperature of the sample
does not necessarily rise. Instead, the sample may change from one phase, or state,
to another. Matter can exist in three common states: In the solid state, the mole-
cules of a sample are locked into a fairly rigid structure by their mutual attraction.
In the liquid state, the molecules have more energy and move about more. They
may form brief clusters, but the sample does not have a rigid structure and can flow
or settle into a container. In the gas, or vapor, state, the molecules have even more
energy, are free of one another, and can fill up the full volume of a container.

Melting. To melt a solid means to change it from the solid state to the liquid
state. The process requires energy because the molecules of the solid must be
freed from their rigid structure. Melting an ice cube to form liquid water is a com-
mon example. To freeze a liquid to form a solid is the reverse of melting and re-
quires that energy be removed from the liquid, so that the molecules can settle
into a rigid structure.
