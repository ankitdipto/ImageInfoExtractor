* Koelreuter noted the basic facts of heredity a century
before Mendel. He found that alternative traits
segregate in crosses and may mask each other’s
appearance. Mendel, however, was the first to
quantify his data, counting the numbers of each
alternative type among the progeny of crosses.

¢ By counting progeny types, Mendel learned that the
alternatives that were masked in hybrids (the F;
generation) appeared only 25% of the time in the F)
generation. This finding, which led directly to
Mendel’s model of heredity, is usually referred to as
the Mendelian ratio of 3:1 dominant-to-recessive
traits.

* When two genes are located on different
chromosomes, the alleles assort independently.

* Because phenotypes are often influenced by more
than one gene, the ratios of alternative phenotypes
observed in crosses sometimes deviate from the
simple ratios predicted by Mendel.

13.2 Human genetics follows Mendelian principles.

1. Why weren’t the implications
of Koelreuter’s results
recognized for a century?

2. What characteristics of the
garden pea made this organism a
good choice for Mendel’s
experiments on heredity?

3. To determine whether a
purple-flowered pea plant of
unknown genotype is
homozygous or heterozygous,
what type of plant should it be
crossed with?

4. Ina dihybrid cross between
two heterozygotes, what fraction
of the offspring should be
homozygous recessive for both
traits?

* Some genetic disorders are relatively common in
human populations; others are rare. Many of the
most important genetic disorders are associated with
recessive alleles, which are not eliminated from the
human population, even though their effects in
homozygotes may be lethal.

13.3 Genes are on chromosomes.

5. Why is Huntington’s disease
maintained at its current
frequency in human
populations?

© The first clear evidence that genes reside on
chromosomes was provided by Thomas Hunt
Morgan, who demonstrated that the segregation of
the white-eye trait in Drosophila is associated with the
segregation of the X chromosome, which is involved
in sex determination.

¢ The first genetic evidence that crossing over occurs
between chromosomes was provided by Curt Stern,
who showed that when two Mendelian traits
exchange during a cross, so do visible abnormalities
on the ends of the chromosomes bearing those traits.

* The frequency of crossing over between genes can be
used to construct genetic maps.

¢ Primary nondisjunction results when chromosomes
do not separate during meiosis, leading to gametes
with missing or extra chromosomes. In humans, the
loss of an autosome is invariably fatal.

6. When Morgan crossed a
white-eyed male fly with a
normal red-eyed female, and
then crossed two of the red-eyed
progeny, about 4 of the
offspring were white-eyed—but
they were ALL male! Why?

7. What is primary
nondisjunction? How is it
related to Down syndrome?

8. Is an individual with
Klinefelter syndrome genetically
male or female? Why?
