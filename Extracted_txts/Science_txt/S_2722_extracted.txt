18-5 THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

transferred to or from the gas because of the insulation. No work is done by the
gas because it rushes into a vacuum and thus does not meet any pressure.

A free expansion differs from all other processes we have considered
because it cannot be done slowly and in a controlled way. As a result, at any
given instant during the sudden expansion, the gas is not in thermal equilib-
rium and its pressure is not uniform. Thus, although we can plot the initial and
final states on a p-V diagram, we cannot plot the expansion itself.

Sample Problem 18.05 First law of thermodynamics: work, heat, internal energy change

Let 1.00 kg of liquid water at 100°C be converted to steam at
100°C by boiling at standard atmospheric pressure (which
is 1.00atm or 1.01 105 Pa) in the arrangement of
Fig. 18-17. The volume of that water changes from an initial
value of 1.00 x 103 m'asa liquid to 1.671 m*as steam.

(a) How much work is done by the system during this process?
KEY IDEAS

(1) The system must do positive work because the volume in-
creases. (2) We calculate the work W done by integrating the
pressure with respect to the volume (Eq. 18-25).

Calculation: Because here the pressure is constant at 1.01 «
10° Pa, we can take p outside the integral. Thus,

Vi Vi

= (1.01 105 Pa)(1.671 m* — 1.00 x 10-3 m’)
= 1.69 X 105J = 169 kJ. (Answer)

(b) How much energy is transferred as heat during the process?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the heat causes only a phase change and not a change
in temperature, it is given fully by Eq. 18-16 (Q = Lm).

Calculation: Because the change is from liquid to gaseous
phase, L is the heat of vaporization Ly, with the value given
in Eq. 18-17 and Table 18-4. We find

OQ = Lym = (2256 kJ/kg)(1.00 kg)

= 2256 kJ ~ 2260 kJ. (Answer)

(c) What is the change in the system’s internal energy during
the process?

fata

KEY IDEA

 

The change in the system’s internal energy is related to the
heat (here, this is energy transferred into the system) and
the work (here, this is energy transferred out of the system)
by the first law of thermodynamics (Eq. 18-26).

Calculation: We write the first law as
AE = Q — W = 2256kJ — 169kJ
=~ 2090 kJ = 2.09 MJ. (Answer)

This quantity is positive, indicating that the internal energy
of the system has increased during the boiling process. The
added energy goes into separating the H,O molecules,
which strongly attract one another in the liquid state. We see
that, when water is boiled, about 7.5% (= 169 kJ/2260 kJ)
of the heat goes into the work of pushing back the atmo-
sphere. The rest of the heat goes into the internal energy
of the system.
