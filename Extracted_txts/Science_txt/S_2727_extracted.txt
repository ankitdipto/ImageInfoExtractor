CHAPTER 18 TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Sample Problem 18.07 Thermal radiation by a skunk cabbage can melt surrounding snow

Unlike most other plants, a skunk cabbage can regulate its
internal temperature (set at T = 22°C) by altering the rate
at which it produces energy. If it becomes covered with
snow, it can increase that production so that its thermal ra-
diation melts the snow in order to re-expose the plant to
sunlight. Let’s model a skunk cabbage with a cylinder of
height h = 5.0 cm and radius R = 1.5 cm and assume it is
surrounded by a snow wall at temperature T.., = —3.0°C
(Fig. 18-23). If the emissivity ¢ is 0.80, what is the net rate
of energy exchange via thermal radiation between the
plant’s curved side and the snow?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Ina steady-state situation, a surface with area A, emissivity
e,and temperature T loses energy to thermal radiation at the
rate given by Eq. 18-38 (Prag = ceAT*). (2) Simultaneously,
it gains energy by thermal radiation from its environment
at temperature T.,, at the rate given by Eq. 18-39 (Peay =
oe ATS).

Calculations: To find the net rate of energy exchange, we
subtract Eq. 18-38 from Eq. 18-39 to write

Poot = Pats — Pras

= oeA(Tiy — T*).
‘We need the area of the curved surface of the cylinder,
which is A = h(27R). We also need the temperatures in
kelvins: T.,, = 273 K — 3 K = 270 K and T = 273 K +
22 K = 295 K. Substituting in Eq. 18-41 for A and then
substituting known values in SI units (which are not dis-
played here), we find

Page = (5.67 X 10-8)(0.80)(0.050)(2.27)(0.015)(270! — 295)
= —048W. (Answer)

(18-41)

Thus, the plant has a net loss of energy via thermal radiation
of 0.48 W. The plant’s energy production rate is comparable
to that of a hummingbird in flight.

Review & Summary

Temperature; Thermometers Temperature is an SI base
quantity related to our sense of hot and cold. It is measured with a
thermometer, which contains a working substance with a measur-
able property, such as length or pressure, that changes in a regular
way as the substance becomes hotter or colder.

Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics When a thermometer and
some other object are placed in contact with each other, they even-
tually reach thermal equilibrium. The reading of the thermometer is
then taken to be the temperature of the other object. The process
provides consistent and useful temperature measurements because
of the zeroth law of thermodynamics: If bodies A and B are each in
thermal equilibrium with a third body C (the thermometer), then A
and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

The Kelvin Temperature Scale In the SI system, tempera-
ture is measured on the Kelvin scale, which is based on the triple
point of water (273.16 K). Other temperatures are then defined by

use of a constant-volume gas thermometer, in which a sample of gas
is maintained at constant volume so its pressure is proportional to
its temperature. We define the temperature T as measured with a
gas thermometer to be

 

T = (273.16 K) ( lim 2 ) (18-6)

gas0 D3

Here T is in kelvins, and p; and p are the pressures of the gas at
273.16 K and the measured temperature, respectively.

Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales The Celsius temperature
scale is defined by

Te = T — 273.15°, (18-7)
with Tin kelvins. The Fahrenheit temperature scale is defined by

Te = $To + 32°. (18-8)
