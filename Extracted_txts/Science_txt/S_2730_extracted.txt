Module 18-1 Temperature

*1 Suppose the temperature of a gas is 373.15 K when it is at the
boiling point of water. What then is the limiting value of the ratio
of the pressure of the gas at that boiling point to its pressure at the
triple point of water? (Assume the volume of the gas is the same at
both temperatures.)

*2 Two constant-volume gas thermometers are assembled, one
with nitrogen and the other with hydrogen. Both contain enough
gas so that p; = 80 kPa. (a) What is the difference between the
pressures in the two thermometers if both bulbs are in boiling
water? (Hint: See Fig, 18-6.) (b) Which gas is at higher pressure?

°3 A gas thermometer is con-
structed of two gas-containing bulbs,
each in a water bath, as shown in
Fig, 18-30. The pressure difference be-
tween the two bulbs is measured by
a mercury manometer as shown.
Appropriate reservoirs, not shown in
the diagram, maintain constant gas volume in the two bulbs. There is
no difference in pressure when both baths are at the triple point of
water. The pressure difference is 120 torr when one bath is at the
triple point and the other is at the boiling point of water. It is 90.0 torr
when one bath is at the triple point and the other is at an unknown
temperature to be measured. What is the unknown temperature?

Module 18-2 The Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales

*4 (a) In 1964, the temperature in the Siberian village of
Oymyakon reached —71°C. What temperature is this on the
Fahrenheit scale? (b) The highest officially recorded temperature in
the continental United States was 134°F in Death Valley, California.
What is this temperature on the Celsius scale?

°5 At what temperature is the Fahrenheit scale reading equal to
(a) twice that of the Celsius scale and (b) half that of the Celsius scale?
**6 Ona linear X temperature scale, water freezes at —125.0°X and
boils at 375.0°X. On a linear Y temperature scale, water freezes at
—70.00°Y and boils at —30.00°Y. A temperature of 50.00°Y corre-
sponds to what temperature on the X scale?

**7 ILW Suppose that on a linear temperature scale X, water boils

at —53.5°X and freezes at —170°X. What is a temperature of 340 K
on the X scale? (Approximate water's boiling point as 373 K.)

Module 18-3 Thermal Expansion

*8 At 20°C, a brass cube has edge length 30 cm. What is the in-
crease in the surface area when it is heated from 20°C to 75°C?

°9 LW A circular hole in an aluminum plate is 2.725cm in
diameter at 0.000°C. What is its diameter when the temperature of
the plate is raised to 100.0°C?

*10 An aluminum flagpole is 33 m high. By how much does its
length increase as the temperature increases by 15 C°?

°11 What is the volume of a lead ball at 30.00°C if the ball’s vol-
ume at 60.00°C is 50.00 cm’?

12 An aluminum-alloy rod has a length of 10.000 cm at 20.000°C
and a length of 10.015 cm at the boiling point of water. (a) What is
the length of the rod at the freezing point of water? (b) What is the
temperature if the length of the rod is 10.009 cm?

°13 SSM Find the change in volume of an aluminum sphere with an
initial radius of 10 cm when the sphere is heated from 0.0°C to 100°C.

*°14 When the temperature of a copper coin is raised by 100 C°,
its diameter increases by 0.18%. To two significant figures, give the
percent increase in (a) the area of a face, (b) the thickness, (c) the
volume, and (d) the mass of the coin. (e) Calculate the coefficient
of linear expansion of the coin.

15 ILW A steel rod is 3.000 cm in diameter at 25.00°C. A brass ring
has an interior diameter of 2.992 cm at 25.00°C. At what common
temperature will the ring just slide onto the rod?

16 When the temperature of a metal cylinder is raised from 0.0°C
to 100°C, its length increases by 0.23%. (a) Find the percent change in
density. (b) What is the metal? Use Table 18-2.

°17 ssM www An aluminum cup of 100 cm’ capacity is com-
pletely filled with glycerin at 22°C. How much glycerin, if any, will
spill out of the cup if the temperature of both the cup and the glyc-
erin is increased to 28°C? (The coefficient of volume expansion of
glycerin is 5.1 X 10-/C°.)

“18 At 20°C, a rod is exactly 20.05cm long on a steel
ruler. Both are placed in an oven at 270°C, where the rod now
measures 20.11 cm on the same ruler. What is the coefficient of
linear expansion for the material of which the rod is made?

the liquid column change when the tube and liquid are heated to
30.000 000°C? Use coefficients a,,,= 1.000 000 x 10-5/K and
Biquia = 4-000 000 X 10-/K. -

20 @ Inacertain experiment,a Radioactive Electric
small radioactive source must source _heatcr
move at selected, extremely slow
speeds. This motion is accom-
plished by fastening the source to
one end of an aluminum rod and
heating the central section of the
rod in a controlled way. If the effective heated section of the rod
in Fig. 18-31 has length d = 2.00 cm, at what constant rate must
the temperature of the rod be changed if the source is to move at
temperature rise of 32 C, a bar

a constant speed of 100 nm/s?
