Module 18-4 Absorption of Heat

°22 <= One way to keep the contents of a garage from becoming
too cold on a night when a severe subfreezing temperature is forecast
is to put a tub of water in the garage. If the mass of the water is 125 kg
and its initial temperature is 20°C, (a) how much energy must the wa-
ter transfer to its surroundings in order to freeze completely and
(b) what is the lowest possible temperature of the water and its sur-
roundings until that happens?

°23 SSM A small electric immersion heater is used to heat 100 g
of water for a cup of instant coffee. The heater is labeled
“200 watts” (it converts electrical energy to thermal energy at this
rate). Calculate the time required to bring all this water from
23.0°C to 100°C, ignoring any heat losses.

24 A certain substance has a mass per mole of 50.0 g/mol. When
314 J is added as heat to a 30.0 g sample, the sample’s temperature
rises from 25.0°C to 45.0°C. What are the (a) specific heat and
(b) molar specific heat of this substance? (c) How many moles are
in the sample?

°25 A certain diet doctor encourages people to diet by drinking
ice water. His theory is that the body must burn off enough fat to
raise the temperature of the water from 0.00°C to the body tem-
perature of 37.0°C. How many liters of ice water would have to be
consumed to burn off 454 g (about 1 Ib) of fat, assuming that burn-
ing this much fat requires 3500 Cal be transferred to the ice water?
Why is it not advisable to follow this diet? (One liter = 10° cm*.
The density of water is 1.00 g/cm*.)

°26 What mass of butter, which has a usable energy content of
6.0 Cal/g (= 6000 cal/g), would be equivalent to the change in grav-
itational potential energy of a 73.0 kg man who ascends from sea
level to the top of Mt. Everest, at elevation 8.84 km? Assume that
the average g for the ascent is 9.80 m/s’.

°27 SSM Calculate the minimum amount of energy, in joules,
required to completely melt 130 g of silver initially at 15.0°C.

°28 How much water remains unfrozen after 50.2 kJ is trans-
ferred as heat from 260 g of liquid water initially at its freezing
point?

*°29 In asolar water heater, energy from the Sun is gathered by
water that circulates through tubes in a rooftop collector. The so-
lar radiation enters the collector through a transparent cover and
warms the water in the tubes; this water is pumped into a holding
tank. Assume that the efficiency of the overall system is 20%
(that is, 80% of the incident solar energy is lost from the system).
What collector area is necessary to raise the temperature of 200
L of water in the tank from 20°C to 40°C in 1.0 h when the inten-
sity of incident sunlight is 700 W/m??

**30 A 0.400 kg sample is placed in a cooling apparatus that re-
moves energy as heat at a con-

stant rate. Figure 18-33 gives 399

the temperature T of the sam-

ple versus time f the horizon-

tal scale is set by ¢,= 80.0 min. g
The sample freezes during the =
energy removal. The specific
heat of the sample in its initial 250
liquid phase is 3000 J/kg-K.
What are (a) the sample’s heat
of fusion and (b) its specific
heat in the frozen phase?

CHAPTER 18 TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

31 ILW What mass of steam at 100°C must be mixed with 150 g
of ice at its melting point, in a thermally insulated container, to
produce liquid water at 50°C?

32 The specific heat of a substance varies with temperature ac-
cording to the function c = 0.20 + 0.147 + 0.02377, with T in °C
and in cal/g- K. Find the energy required to raise the temperature
of 2.0 g of this substance from 5.0°C to 15°C.

°33 Nonmetric version: (a) How long does a 2.0 X 10° Btu/h water
heater take to raise the temperature of 40 gal of water from 70°F to
100°F? Metric version: (b) How long does a 59 kW water heater take
toraise the temperature of 150 L of water from 21°C to 38°C?

34 @ Samples A and B are at different initial temperatures
when they are placed in a thermally insulated container and al-
lowed to come to thermal equilibrium. Figure 18-34a gives their
temperatures T versus time ¢. Sample A has a mass of 5.0 kg; sam-
ple B has a mass of 1.5kg, Figure 18-34b is a general plot for
the material of sample B. It shows the temperature change AT that
the material undergoes when energy is transferred to it as heat Q.
The change AT is plotted versus the energy Q per unit mass of the
material, and the scale of the vertical axis is set by AT, = 4.0 C°.

*35 An insulated Thermos contains 130cm* of hot coffee at
80.0°C. You put in a 12.0 g ice cube at its melting point to cool the
coffee. By how many degrees has your coffee cooled once the ice
has melted and equilibrium is reached? Treat the coffee as
though it were pure water and neglect energy exchanges with the
environment.

36 A150 g copper bowl contains 220 g of water, both at 20.0°C. A
very hot 300 g copper cylinder is dropped into the water, causing the
water to boil, with 5.00 g being converted to steam. The final tem-
perature of the system is 100°C. Neglect energy transfers with the
environment. (a) How much energy (in calories) is transferred to
the water as heat? (b) How much to the bowl? (c) What is the orig-
inal temperature of the cylinder?

37 A person makes a quantity of iced tea by mixing 500 g of hot
tea (essentially water) with an equal mass of ice at its melting
point. Assume the mixture has negligible energy exchanges with its
environment. If the tea’s initial temperature is T; = 90°C, when
thermal equilibrium is reached what are (a) the mixture’s tempera-
ture T; and (b) the remaining mass m; of ice? If T; = 70°C, when
thermal equilibrium is reached what are (c) T; and (d) m;?

38 A 0.530 kg sample of liquid water and a sample of ice are
placed in a thermally insulated container. The container also con-
tains a device that transfers energy as heat from the liquid water
to the ice at a constant rate P, until thermal equilibrium is
