+39 © Ethyl alcohol has a boiling point of 78.0°C, a freezing
point of —114°C, a heat of vaporization of 879 kI/kg, a heat of fu-
sion of 109 kJ/kg, and a specific heat of 2.43 kJ/kg: K. How much
energy must be removed from 0.510 kg of ethyl alcohol that is ini-
tially a gas at 78.0°C so that it becomes a solid at — 114°C?

40 @ Calculate the specific heat of a metal from the following,
data. A container made of the metal has a mass of 3.6 kg and con-
tains 14 kg of water. A 1.8 kg piece of the metal initially at a tem-
perature of 180°C is dropped into the water. The container and
water initially have a temperature of 16.0°C, and the final tempera-
ture of the entire (insulated) system is 18.0°C.

e41 SSM WWW (a) Two 50 g ice cubes are dropped into 200 g
of water in a thermally insulated container. If the water is initially
at 25°C, and the ice comes directly from a freezer at —15°C, what is
the final temperature at thermal equilibrium? (b) What is the final
temperature if only one ice cube is used?

D =2.54000cm. An aluminum
sphere at 100.0°C has a diameter
of d = 2.545 08 cm. The sphere is
put on top of the ring (Fig. 18-36),
and the two are allowed to come
to thermal equilibrium, with no
heat lost to the surroundings. The
sphere just passes through the
