closed cycle for a gas (the figure is not a
drawn to scale). The change in the inter-

nal energy of the gas as it moves from a 7

transferred to it as heat. An additional §=[.-______

transfer of 80 J to it as heat is needed as
it moves from d to a. How much work is
done on the gas as it moves from c to d?

through cycle abca shown in the p-V
diagram of Fig. 18-43. The net work a 6
done is +1.2J. Along path ab, the
change in the internal energy is +3.0 J
and the magnitude of the work done
is 5.0J. Along path ca, the energy ©

*51 A sphere of radius 0.500 m, temperature 27.0°C, and emissiv-
ity 0.850 is located in an environment of temperature 77.0°C. At
what rate does the sphere (a) emit and (b) absorb thermal radia-
tion? (c) What is the sphere’s net rate of energy exchange?

52 The ceiling of a single-family dwelling in a cold climate
should have an R-value of 30. To give such insulation, how thick
would a layer of (a) polyurethane foam and (b) silver have to be?

°53 ssM Consider the slab shown in Fig. 18-18. Suppose that
L = 25.0cm, A = 90.0 cm’, and the material is copper. If Ty =
125°C, Tc = 10.0°C, and a steady state is reached, find the conduc-
tion rate through the slab.

°54 <= If you were to walk briefly in space without a spacesuit
while far from the Sun (as an astronaut does in the movie 2001, A
Space Odyssey), you would feel the cold of space —while you radi-
ated energy, you would absorb almost none from your environ-
ment. (a) At what rate would you lose energy? (b) How much en-
ergy would you lose in 30 s? Assume that your emissivity is 0.90,
and estimate other data needed in the calculations.

and the other in a mixture of boiling water and steam. At what rate
(a) is energy conducted by the rod and (b) does the ice melt?

CHAPTER 18 TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

a beehive, several hundred of the bees quickly form a compact
ball around the hornet to stop it. They don’t sting, bite, crush, or
suffocate it. Rather they overheat it by quickly raising their body
temperatures from the normal 35°C to 47°C or 48°C, which is
lethal to the hornet but not to the bees (Fig. 18-44). Assume the
following: 500 bees form a ball of radius R = 2.0 cm for a time t=
20 min, the primary loss of energy by the ball is by thermal radia-
tion, the ball’s surface has emissivity ¢ = 0.80, and the ball has a
uniform temperature. On average, how much additional energy
must each bee produce during the 20 min to maintain 47°C?

57 (a) What is the rate of energy loss in watts per square meter
through a glass window 3.0 mm thick if the outside temperature is
—20°F and the inside temperature is +72°F? (b) A storm window
having the same thickness of glass is installed parallel to the first
window, with an air gap of 7.5 cm between the two windows. What
now is the rate of energy loss if conduction is the only important
energy-loss mechanism?

58 A solid cylinder of radius r; = 2.5 cm, length f, = 5.0 cm,

radiation transfer rate P;? (b) If the cylinder is stretched until its

comes P3. What is the ratio P;/P;?
