°°62 <= Leidenfrost effect. A Water drop

water drop will last about 1 s on a an

hot skillet with a temperature TE fr ae
skillet

between 100°C and about 200°C.
However, if the skillet is much hot-
ter, the drop can last several min-
utes, an effect named after an early investigator. The longer lifetime
is due to the support of a thin layer of air and water vapor that sepa-
rates the drop from the metal (by distance L in Fig. 18-48). Let L =
0.100 mm, and assume that the drop is flat with height 4 = 1.50 mm
and bottom face area A = 4.00 X 10-° m’. Also assume that the
skillet has a constant temperature T, = 300°C and the drop has a
temperature of 100°C. Water has density p = 1000 kg/m’, and the
supporting layer has thermal conductivity k = 0.026 W/m-K. (a) At
what rate is energy conducted from the skillet to the drop through
the drop’s bottom surface? (b) If conduction is the primary way en-
ergy moves from the skillet to the drop, how long will the drop last?

the Antarctic, emperor penguins huddle in groups (Fig. 18-50).
Assume that a penguin is a circular cylinder with a top surface area
a=0.34 m’ and height A = 1.1 m. Let P, be the rate at which an in-
dividual penguin radiates energy to the environment (through the
top and the sides); thus NP, is the rate at which N identical, well-
separated penguins radiate. If the penguins huddle closely to form

fraction P,/NP, and (b) by what percentage does huddling reduce
the total radiation loss?

“65 Ice has formed on a shallow pond, and a steady state has
been reached, with the air above the ice at —5.0°C and the bottom
of the pond at 4.0°C. If the total depth of ice + water is 1.4 m, how
thick is the ice? (Assume that the thermal conductivities of ice and
water are 0.40 and 0.12 cal/m:C°-s, respectively.)

66 & xe Evaporative cooling of beverages. A cold beverage
can be kept cold even on a warm day if it is slipped into a porous
ceramic container that has been soaked in water. Assume that en-
ergy lost to evaporation matches the net energy gained via the ra-
diation exchange through the top and side surfaces. The container
and beverage have temperature T=15°C, the environment has
temperature T.,,=32°C, and the container is a cylinder with
radius r= 2.2 cm and height 10 cm. Approximate the emissivity as
e =1, and neglect other energy exchanges. At what rate di/dt is
the container losing water mass?

67 In the extrusion of cold chocolate from a tube, work is done
on the chocolate by the pressure applied by a ram forcing the
chocolate through the tube. The work per unit mass of extruded
chocolate is equal to p/p, where p is the difference between the ap-
plied pressure and the pressure where the chocolate emerges from
the tube, and pis the density of the chocolate. Rather than increas-
ing the temperature of the chocolate, this work melts cocoa fats in
the chocolate. These fats have a heat of fusion of 150 kJ/kg. Assume
that all of the work goes into that melting and that these fats make
up 30% of the chocolate’s mass. What percentage of the fats melt
during the extrusion if p = 5.5 MPa and p = 1200 kg/m*?

68 Icebergs in the North Atlantic present hazards to shipping,
causing the lengths of shipping routes to be increased by about 30%
during the iceberg season. Attempts to destroy icebergs include
planting explosives, bombing, torpedoing, shelling, ramming, and
coating with black soot. Suppose that direct melting of the iceberg, by
placing heat sources in the ice, is tried. How much energy as heat is
required to melt 10% of an iceberg that has a mass of 200 000 metric
tons? (Use 1 metricton = 1000 kg.)
