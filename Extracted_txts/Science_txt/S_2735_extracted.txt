72 The average rate at which energy is conducted outward
through the ground surface in North America is 54,0 mW/m?, and
the average thermal conductivity of the near-surface rocks is 2.50
W/m: K. Assuming a surface temperature of 10.0°C, find the tem-
perature at a depth of 35.0 km (near the base of the crust). Ignore
the heat generated by the presence of radioactive elements.

an edge when heated from 10.0°C to 60.0°C?

74 In a series of experiments,
block B is to be placed in a ther-
mally insulated container with
block A, which has the same mass as
block B. In each experiment, block
B is initially at a certain tempera-
ture T,, but temperature T, of
block A is changed from experi- 0
ment to experiment. Let 7; repre- Ta

two blocks when they reach thermal
equilibrium in any of the experi-
ments. Figure 18-53 gives temperature 7; versus the initial tem-
perature T, for a range of possible values of Ty, from Ty, =0 K
to Ty, =500 K. The vertical axis scale is set by Tj, = 400 K. What
are (a) temperature Ty and (b) the ratio cg/c, of the specific
heats of the blocks?

76 Three equal-length straight rods, of aluminum, Invar, and
steel, all at 20.0°C, form an equilateral triangle with hinge pins at
the vertices. At what temperature will the angle opposite the Invar
rod be 59.95°? See Appendix E for needed trigonometric formulas
and Table 18-2 for needed data.

77 ssm The temperature of a 0.700 kg cube of ice is decreased
to —150°C. Then energy is gradually transferred to the cube as
heat while it is otherwise thermally
isolated from its environment. The
total transfer is 0.6993 MJ. Assume.

perature change in those directions. It can lose energy and freeze
only by sending energy up (through distance L) to the top of the
icicle, where the temperature 7, can be below 0°C. Take L = 0.12 m
and T,= —5°C. Assume that the central tube and the upward con-
duction path both have cross-sectional area A. In terms of A, what
rate is (a) energy conducted upward and (b) mass converted from
liquid to ice at the top of the central tube? (c) At what rate does
the top of the tube move downward because of water freezing
there? The thermal conductivity of ice is 0.400 W/m-K, and the
density of liquid water is 1000 kg/m’.

79 ssm A sample of gas expands from an initial pressure and
volume of 10 Pa and 1.0 m’ to a final volume of 2.0 m*. During the
expansion, the pressure and volume are related by the equation
p = aV?, where a = 10 N/m*. Determine the work done by the gas
during this expansion.

80 Figure 18-56a shows a cylinder containing gas and closed by a
movable piston. The cylinder is kept submerged in an ice—water mix-
ture. The piston is quickly pushed down from position 1 to position 2
and then held at position 2 until the gas is again at the temperature of
the ice—water mixture; it then is slowly raised back to position 1.
Figure 18-56b is a p-V diagram for the process. If 100 g of ice is
melted during the cycle, how much work has been done on the gas?

6.00 m length and 1.00 cm diameter, are placed end to end with the
aluminum rod between the other two. The free end of the copper
rod is maintained at water’s boiling point, and the free end of the
brass rod is maintained at water’s freezing point. What is the
steady-state temperature of (a) the copper—aluminum junction
