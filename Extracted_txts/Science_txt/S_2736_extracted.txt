84 (a) Calculate the rate at which body heat is conducted
through the clothing of a skier in a steady-state process, given the
following data: the body surface area is 1.8 m’, and the clothing is
1.0 cm thick; the skin surface temperature is 33°C and the outer
surface of the clothing is at 1.0°C; the thermal conductivity of the
clothing is 0.040 W/mK. (b) If, after a fall, the skier’s clothes be-
came soaked with water of thermal conductivity 0.60 W/m-K, by
how much is the rate of conduction multiplied?

85 ssm A2.50 kg lump of aluminum is heated to 92.0°C and then
dropped into 8.00kg of water at 5.00°C. Assuming that the
lump-water system is thermally isolated, what is the system’s equi-
librium temperature?

86 A glass window pane is exactly 20 cm by 30 cm at 10°C. By
how much has its area increased when its temperature is 40°C, as-
suming that it can expand freely?

87 A recruit can join the semi-secret “300F” club at the
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station only when the outside tem-
perature is below —70°C. On such a day, the recruit first basks in a
hot sauna and then runs outside wearing only shoes. (This is, of
course, extremely dangerous, but the rite is effectively a protest
against the constant danger of the cold.)

Assume that upon stepping out of the sauna, the recruit’s skin
temperature is 102°F and the walls, ceiling, and floor of the sauna
room have a temperature of 30°C. Estimate the recruit’s surface
area, and take the skin emissivity to be 0.80. (a) What is the ap-
proximate net rate P,,. at which the recruit loses energy via ther-
mal radiation exchanges with the room? Next, assume that when
outdoors, half the recruit’s surface area exchanges thermal radia-
tion with the sky at a temperature of —25°C and the other half
exchanges thermal radiation with the snow and ground at a tem-
perature of —80°C. What is the approximate net rate at which the
recruit loses energy via thermal radiation exchanges with (b) the
sky and (c) the snow and ground?

88 A steel rod at 25.0°C is bolted at both ends and then cooled.
At what temperature will it rupture? Use Table 12-1.

89 An athlete needs to lose weight and decides to do it by
“pumping iron.” (a) How many times must an 80.0 kg weight be
lifted a distance of 1.00 m in order to burn off 1.00 lb of fat, assum-
ing that that much fat is equivalent to 3500 Cal? (b) If the weight is
lifted once every 2.00 s, how long does the task take?

90 Soon after Earth was formed, heat released by the decay of ra-
dioactive elements raised the average internal temperature from 300
to 3000 K, at about which value it remains today. Assuming an aver-
age coefficient of volume expansion of 3.0 x 10-5 K~!, by how much
has the radius of Earth increased since the planet was formed?

92 A rectangular plate of glass initially has the dimensions 0.200 m
by 0.300 m. The coefficient of linear expansion for the glass is
9.00 X 10~°/K. What is the change in the plate’s area if its tempera-
ture is increased by 20.0 K?

93 Suppose that you intercept 5.0 X 1079 of the energy radiated
by a hot sphere that has a radius of 0.020 m, an emissivity of 0.80,
and a surface temperature of 500 K. How much energy do you in-
tercept in 2.0 min?

the water. If the thermometer then reads 44.4°C, what was the tem-
perature of the water before insertion of the thermometer?

97 On finding your stove out of order, you decide to boil the wa-
ter for a cup of tea by shaking it in a thermos flask. Suppose that
you use tap water at 19°C, the water falls 32 cm each shake, and
you make 27 shakes each minute. Neglecting any loss of thermal
energy by the flask, how long (in minutes) must you shake the flask
until the water reaches 100°C?

that energy equal to 5.0p;V; be trans-
ferred to the gas as heat. Path 2 requires
that energy equal to 5.5p,V, be trans-
ferred to the gas as heat. What is the ra-

100 A flow calorimeter is a device used to measure the specific
heat of a liquid. Energy is added as heat at a known rate to a
stream of the liquid as it passes through the calorimeter at a
known rate. Measurement of the resulting temperature difference
between the inflow and the outflow points of the liquid stream en-
ables us to compute the specific heat of the liquid. Suppose a liquid
of density 0.85 g/cm flows through a calorimeter at the rate of 8.0
cm*/s, When energy is added at the rate of 250 W by means of an
electric heating coil, a temperature difference of 15 C° is estab-
lished in steady-state conditions between the inflow and the out-
flow points. What is the specific heat of the liquid?

potential energy of the object is fully transferred to thermal en-
ergy of the water, which is initially at 15.0°C. What is the temper-
ature rise of the water?
