102 The Pyrex glass mirror in a telescope has a diameter of
170 in. The temperature ranges from —16°C to 32°C on the loca-
tion of the telescope. What is the maximum change in the diam-
eter of the mirror, assuming that the glass can freely expand and
contract?

103 The area A of a rectangular plate is ab = 1.4 m?. Its coeffi-
cient of linear expansion is a = 32 X 10-%/C®. After a tempera-
ture rise AT = 89°C, side a is longer by Aa and side b is longer
by Ab (Fig. 18-61). Neglecting the small quantity (Aa Ab)/ab,
find AA,

CHAPTER 18 TEMPERATURE, HEAT, AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

104 Consider the liquid in a barometer whose coefficient of
volume expansion is 6.6 X 10-4/C°. Find the relative change in the
liquid’s height if the temperature changes by 12 C? while the pres-
sure remains constant. Neglect the expansion of the glass tube.

105 A pendulum clock with a pendulum made of brass is de-
signed to keep accurate time at 23°C. Assume it is a simple pendu-
lum consisting of a bob at one end of a brass rod of negligible mass
that is pivoted about the other end. If the clock operates at 0.0°C,
(a) does it run too fast or too slow, and (b) what is the magnitude of
its error in seconds per hour?

106 A room is lighted by four 100 W incandescent lightbulbs.
(The power of 100 Wis the rate at which a bulb converts electrical
energy to heat and the energy of visible light.) Assuming that 73%
of the energy is converted to heat, how much heat does the room
receive in 6.9 h?

107 An energetic athlete can use up all the energy from a diet of
4000 Cal/day. If he were to use up this energy at a steady rate, what
is the ratio of the rate of energy use compared to that of a 100 W
bulb? (The power of 100 W is the rate at which the bulb converts
electrical energy to heat and the energy of visible light.)

108 A 1700 kg Buick moving at 83 km/h brakes to a stop, at uni-
form deceleration and without skidding, over a distance of 93 m.
At what average rate is mechanical energy transferred to thermal
energy in the brake system?
