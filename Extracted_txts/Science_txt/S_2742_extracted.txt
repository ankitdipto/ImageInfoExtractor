For an expansion, Vis greater than V,, so the ratio V;/V; in Eq. 19-14 is greater
than unity. The natural logarithm of a quantity greater than unity is positive, and
so the work W done by an ideal gas during an isothermal expansion is positive, as
we expect. For a compression, Vj is less than V;,, so the ratio of volumes in
Eg. 19-14 is less than unity. The natural logarithm in that equation—hence the
work W—is negative, again as we expect.

Work Done at Constant Volume and at Constant Pressure

Equation 19-14 does not give the work W done by an ideal gas during every
thermodynamic process. Instead, it gives the work only for a process in which
the temperature is held constant. If the temperature varies, then the symbol T
in Eq. 19-12 cannot be moved in front of the integral symbol as in Eq. 19-13, and
thus we do not end up with Eq. 19-14.

However, we can always go back to Eq. 19-11 to find the work W done by
an ideal gas (or any other gas) during any process, such as a constant-volume
process and a constant-pressure process. If the volume of the gas is constant, then
Eq. 19-11 yields

w=0 (19-15)

If, instead, the volume changes while the pressure p of the gas is held constant,
then Eq. 19-11 becomes

(constant-volume process).

W=p(V— Vj) = pAV _ (constant-pressure process).

lv] Checkpoint 1

An ideal gas has an initial pressure of 3 pressure units and
an initial volume of 4 volume units. The table gives the
final pressure and volume of the gas (in those same units)
in five processes. Which processes start and end on the
same isotherm?

19-2 IDEAL GASES

Ideal gas and changes of temperature, volume, and pressure

553

A cylinder contains 12 L of oxygen at 20°C and 15 atm. The
temperature is raised to 35°C, and the volume is reduced to
8.5 L. What is the final pressure of the gas in atmospheres?
Assume that the gas is ideal.

KEY IDEA

 

Because the gas is ideal, we can use the ideal gas law to relate
its parameters, both in the initial state i and in the final state f.

Calculations: From Eq. 19-5 we can write
pVj=nRT; and  pV=nRT;.
Dividing the second equation by the first equation and solving
for py yields

Note here that if we converted the given initial and final
volumes from liters to the proper units of cubic meters,
the multiplying conversion factors would cancel out of
Eg. 19-17. The same would be true for conversion factors
that convert the pressures from atmospheres to the
proper pascals. However, to convert the given tempera-
tures to kelvins requires the addition of an amount that
would not cancel and thus must be included. Hence, we
must write

T; = (273 + 20) K = 293K
and T, = (273 + 35) K = 308K.

Inserting the given data into Eq. 19-17 then yields

_ (15 atm)(308 K)(12 L)

= 22 atm.
