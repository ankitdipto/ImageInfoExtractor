Sample Problem 19.02 Work by an ideal gas

One mole of oxygen (assume it to be an ideal gas) expands
at a constant temperature T of 310 K from an initial volume
V; of 12 L to a final volume V; of 19 L. How much work is
done by the gas during the expansion?

KEY IDEA

 

Generally we find the work by integrating the gas pressure
with respect to the gas volume, using Eq. 19-11. However,
because the gas here is ideal and the expansion is isother-
mal, that integration leads to Eq. 19-14.

Calculation: Therefore, we can write

W = nRTIn 2
19L
= (1 mol)(8.31 Jmol-K)(310 K) In <5
= 1180]. (Answer)

The expansion is graphed in the p-V diagram of Fig. 19-3.
The work done by the gas during the expansion is repre-
sented by the area beneath the curve if

CHAPTER 19 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

‘You can show that if the expansion is now reversed,
with the gas undergoing an isothermal compression from
19 L to 12 L, the work done by the gas will be — 1180 J. Thus,
an external force would have to do 1180J of work on the
gas to compress it.

container is due to the molecular collisions with the walls.

19.18 For an ideal gas, apply the relationship between the
gas temperature T and the rms speed v,,,, and molar mass
M of the molecules.

 

@ In terms of the speed of the gas molecules, the pressure

where Vins = V (V)ayg is the root-mean-square speed of the

molecules, M is the molar mass, and V is the volume.

Pressure, Temperature, and RMS Speed

Here is our first kinetic theory problem. Let n moles of an ideal gas be confined
in a cubical box of volume V, as in Fig. 19-4. The walls of the box are held at
temperature 7. What is the connection between the pressure p exerted by the gas
on the walls and the speeds of the molecules?
