(at 27°C or 81°F) that represents a fairly warm

The square root of (v)ayy is a kind of average speed, called the root-mean-
square speed of the molecules and symbolized by V,ms. Its name describes it
rather well: You square each speed, you find the mean (that is, the average) of
all these squared speeds, and then you take the square root of that mean. With

(Y)avg = Ves» We can then write Eq. 19-20 as

NMV2n5

p= (19-21)

This tells us how the pressure of the gas (a purely macroscopic quantity) depends
on the speed of the molecules (a purely microscopic quantity).

We can turn Eq. 19-21 around and use it to calculate Vzms. Combining
Eq. 19-21 with the ideal gas law (pV = nRT) leads to

Table 19-1 shows some rms speeds calculated from Eq. 19-22. The speeds are
surprisingly high. For hydrogen molecules at room temperature (300 K), the
rms speed is 1920 m/s, or 4300 mi/h— faster than a speeding bullet! On the sur-
face of the Sun, where the temperature is 2 x 10° K, the rms speed of hydrogen
molecules would be 82 times greater than at room temperature were it not for
the fact that at such high speeds, the molecules cannot survive collisions among
themselves. Remember too that the rms speed is only a kind of average speed;
many molecules move much faster than this, and some much slower.

The speed of sound in a gas is closely related to the rms speed of the mole-
cules of that gas. In a sound wave, the disturbance is passed on from molecule to
molecule by means of collisions. The wave cannot move any faster than the
“average” speed of the molecules. In fact, the speed of sound must be somewhat
less than this “average” molecular speed because not all molecules are moving in
exactly the same direction as the wave. As examples, at room temperature, the
rms speeds of hydrogen and nitrogen molecules are 1920 m/s and 517 m/s,
respectively. The speeds of sound in these two gases at this temperature are
1350 m/s and 350 m/s, respectively.

A question often arises: If molecules move so fast, why does it take as long as
a minute or so before you can smell perfume when someone opens a bottle
across a room? The answer is that, as we shall discuss in Module 19-5, each
perfume molecule may have a high speed but it moves away from the bottle only
very slowly because its repeated collisions with other molecules prevent it from
moving directly across the room to you.

Sample Problem 19.03 Average and rms values

Here are five numbers: 5, 11, 32,67, and 89.

(a) Whatis the average value nay, of these numbers?

Calculation: We find this from

ae es COMO,

Nayg = 5

(b) What is the rms value n,.,, of these numbers?

Calculation: We find this from

 

= 52.1. (Answer)

= 40.8. (Answer) The rms value is greater than the average value because

the larger numbers—being squared—are relatively more
important in forming the rms value.
