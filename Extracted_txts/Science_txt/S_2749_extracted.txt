CHAPTER 19 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

Sample Problem 19.04 Mean free path, average speed, collision frequency

(a) What is the mean free path A for oxygen molecules at
temperature T = 300 K and pressure p = 1.0 atm? Assume
that the molecular diameter is d = 290 pm and the gas is
ideal.

KEY IDEA

 

Each oxygen molecule moves among other moving oxygen
molecules in a zigzag path due to the resulting collisions. Thus,
we use Eq. 19-25 for the mean free path.

Calculation: We first need the number of molecules per unit
volume, N/V. Because we assume the gas is ideal, we can use
the ideal gas law of Eq. 19-9 (pV = NkT) to write N/V =
pI/KT. Substituting this into Eq. 19-25, we find

=11X107m. (Answer)
This is about 380 molecular diameters.

(b) Assume the average speed of the oxygen molecules is
v = 450 m/s. What is the average time ¢ between successive

collisions for any given molecule? At what rate does
the molecule collide; that is, what is the frequency f of its
collisions?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Between collisions, the molecule travels, on average, the
mean free path A at speed v. (2) The average rate or fre-
quency at which the collisions occur is the inverse of the
time ¢ between collisions.

Calculations: From the first key idea, the average time
between collisions is

= 2.44 x 107s = 0.24 ns. (Answer)
This tells us that, on average, any given oxygen molecule has
less than a nanosecond between collisions.
From the second key idea, the collision frequency is

This tells us that, on average, any given oxygen molecule
makes about 4 billion collisions per second.
