19-6 THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR SPEEDS

Sample Problem 19.05 Speed distribution in a gas

Tn oxygen (molar mass M = 0.0320 kg/mol) at room temper-
ature (300 K), what fraction of the molecules have speeds in
the interval 599 to 601 m/s?

KEY IDEAS

1. The speeds of the molecules are distributed over a wide
range of values, with the distribution P(v) of Eq. 19-27.

2. The fraction of molecules with speeds in a differential
interval dv is P(v) dv.

3. For a larger interval, the fraction is found by integrating
P(v) over the interval.

4. However, the interval Av = 2 m/s here is small compared
to the speed v = 600 m/s on which it is centered.

Calculations: Because Av is small, we can avoid the inte-
gration by approximating the fraction as

3/2, 9
y2e-Mv22RT Ay.

frac = P(v) Av = to(5 te

The total area under the plot of P(v) in Fig. 19-8a is the
total fraction of molecules (unity), and the area of the thin
gold strip (not to scale) is the fraction we seek. Let’s evalu-
ate frac in parts:

frac = (47)(A)(v’)(e%) (Av), (19-36)
where

As ( M y _ ( 0.0320 kg/mol y

and B = — v2. _ _ (0.0320 kg/mol)(600 m/s)?
2RT (2)(831 J/mol-K)(300 K)
= -231.

Substituting A and B into Eq. 19-36 yields
frac = (47)(A)(v’)(e8)(Av)
= (47)(2.92 x 10~° s*/m3) (600 m/s)?(e~?3")(2 m/s)
= 2.62 x 10-3 = 0.262%. (Answer)

Sample Problem 19.06 Average speed, rms speed, most probable speed

The molar mass M of oxygen is 0.0320 kg/mol.

(a) What is the average speed vy, of oxygen gas molecules
at T = 300 K?

KEY IDEA

 

To find the average speed, we must weight speed v with the
distribution function P(v) of Eq. 19-27 and then integrate
the resulting expression over the range of possible speeds
(from zero to the limit of an infinite speed).
Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-31, which gives us

This result is plotted in Fig. 19-8.
(b) What is the root-mean-square speed V,m, at 300 K?
KEY IDEA

To find Vzm., we must first find (V”),y. by weighting v? with
the distribution function P(v) of Eq. 19-27 and then inte-
grating the expression over the range of possible speeds.
Then we must take the square root of the result.

Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-34, which gives us

Vems = WT

= 483 mis. (Answer)

This result, plotted in Fig. 19-8a, is greater than Vays because
the greater speed values influence the calculation more when
we integrate the v? values than when we integrate the v values.

(c) What is the most probable speed vp at 300 K?

 

KEY IDEA

 

Speed vp corresponds to the maximum of the distribution
function P(v), which we obtain by setting the derivative
dP/dv = 0 and solving the result for v.
Calculation: We end up with Eq. 19-35, which gives us
