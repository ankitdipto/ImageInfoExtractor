This prediction of kinetic theory agrees well with experiment, not only for
monatomic gases but also for gases in general, as long as their density is low

enough so that we may treat them as ideal.

The left side of Fig. 19-12 shows the relative values of Q for a monatomic gas
undergoing either a constant-volume process (Q = anR AT) or a constant-
pressure process (Q = 3nR AT). Note that for the latter, the value of Q is higher
by the amount W, the work done by the gas in the expansion. Note also that for
the constant-volume process, the energy added as Q goes entirely into the change
in internal energy AE;,, and for the constant-pressure process, the energy added

as Q goes into both AE;,, and the work W.

The figure here shows five paths traversed by a gas on a
p-V diagram. Rank the paths according to the change in
internal energy of the gas, greatest first.

 

Sample Problem 19.07 Monatomic gas, heat, internal energy, and work

A bubble of 5.00 mol of helium is submerged at a certain depth
in liquid water when the water (and thus the helium) undergoes
a temperature increase AT of 20.0 C at constant pressure. As a
result, the bubble expands. The helium is monatomic and ideal.

(a) How much energy is added to the helium as heat during
the increase and expansion?

KEY IDEA

Heat Q is related to the temperature change AT by a molar
specific heat of the gas.

Calculations: Because the pressure p is held constant dur-
ing the addition of energy, we use the molar specific heat at

constant pressure C, and Eq. 19-46,

Q =n, AT, (19-50)
to find Q. To evaluate C, we go to Eq. 19-49, which tells us
that for any ideal gas, C, = Cy + R. Then from Eq. 19-43, we
know that for any monatomic gas (like the helium here),
C= 3R. Thus, Eg. 19-50 gives us

Q =n(Cy + R) AT =nGR + R) AT = nGR) AT
= (5.00 mol)(2.5)(8.31 J/mol-K)(20.0 C’)

= 2077.5 J ~ 2080 J. (Answer)

(b) What is the change AE;,; in the internal energy of the
helium during the temperature increase?
