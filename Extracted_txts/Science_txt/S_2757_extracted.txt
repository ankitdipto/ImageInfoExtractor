KEY IDEA

 

Because the bubble expands, this is not a constant-volume
process. However, the helium is nonetheless confined (to the
bubble). Thus, the change AE;,, is the same as would occur in a
constant-volume process with the same temperature change AT.

Calculation: We can now easily find the constant-volume
change AE;,, with Eq. 19-45:

AE = nCy AT = n(3R) AT
= (5.00 mol)(1.5)(8.31 J/mol-K)(20.0 C?)
= 1246.5 J ~ 1250J. (Answer)

(c) How much work W is done by the helium as it expands
against the pressure of the surrounding water during the
temperature increase?

KEY IDEAS

The work done by any gas expanding against the pressure
from its environment is given by Eq. 19-11, which tells us to in-

CHAPTER 19 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

tegrate p dV. When the pressure is constant (as here), we can
simplify that to W = p AV. When the gas is ideal (as here), we
can use the ideal gas law (Eq. 19-5) to write p AV = nR AT.

Calculation: We end up with
W=nRAT
= (5.00 mol)(8.31 J/mol - K) (20.0 C?)

= 8315. (Answer)

Another way: Because we happen to know Q and AE;,,, we can
work this problem another way: We can account for the energy
changes of the gas with the first law of thermodynamics, writing
W = Q— AE, = 2077.5 J — 1246.5 J

=831J. (Answer)
The transfers: Let’s follow the energy. Of the 2077.5 J
transferred to the helium as heat Q, 831 J goes into the work
W required for the expansion and 1246.5 J goes into the inter-
nal energy E;,,, which, for a monatomic gas, is entirely the ki-
netic energy of the atoms in their translational motion. These
several results are suggested on the left side of Fig. 19-12.

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to... .

19.39 Identify that a degree of freedom is associated with
each way a gas can store energy (translation, rotation, and
oscillation).

19.40 Identify that an energy of 3kT per molecule is associ-
ated with each degree of freedom.

19.41 Identify that a monatomic gas can have an internal
energy consisting of only translational motion.

Key Ideas

@ We find Cy by using the equipartition of energy theorem,
which states that every degree of freedom of a molecule
(that is, every independent way it can store energy) has
associated with it-on average—an energy 3kT per molecule
(= 3RT per mole).

@ If f is the number of degrees of freedom, then

19.42 Identify that at low temperatures a diatomic gas has
energy in only translational motion, at higher temperatures it
also has energy in molecular rotation, and at even higher
temperatures it can also have energy in molecular oscillations.

19.43 Calculate the molar specific heat for monatomic and di-
atomic ideal gases in a constant-volume process anda
constant-pressure process.

Eig, = (f/2)nRT and
G= (Le = 4.16f J/mol-K.

@ For monatomic gases f = 3 (three translational degrees);

for diatomic gases f = 5 (three translational and two rota-

tional degrees).

Degrees of Freedom and Molar Specific Heats

As Table 19-2 shows, the prediction that Cy = 3R agrees with experiment for
monatomic gases but fails for diatomic and polyatomic gases. Let us try to explain
the discrepancy by considering the possibility that molecules with more than one
atom can store internal energy in forms other than translational kinetic energy.
Figure 19-13 shows common models of helium (a monatomic molecule, con-
taining a single atom), oxygen (a diatomic molecule, containing two atoms), and
