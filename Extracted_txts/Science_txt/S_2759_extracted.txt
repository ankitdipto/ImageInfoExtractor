energy? Of that amount, how much goes into AK ra, (the ki-
netic energy of the translational motion of the molecules) and
AK, (the kinetic energy of their rotational motion)?

KEY IDEAS

1. The transfer of energy as heat Q to a gas under constant
pressure is related to the resulting temperature increase
AT via Eq. 19-46 (Q = nC, AT).

2. Because the gas is diatomic with molecules undergoing
rotation but not oscillation, the molar specific heat is,
from Fig. 19-12 and Table 19-3, C, = aR.

3. The increase AE;,, in the internal energy is the same as
would occur with a constant-volume process resulting in
the same AT. Thus, from Eq. 19-45, AE; =nCy AT. From
Fig. 19-12 and Table 19-3, we see that Cy BR.

4, For the same n and AT, AE;,; is greater for a diatomic gas
than for a monatomic gas because additional energy is
required for rotation.

 

 

Increase in E;,,: Let’s first get the temperature change AT due
to the transfer of energy as heat. From Eq. 19-46, substituting
3R for C,, we have

We next find AE;, from Eq. 19-45, substituting the molar
specific heat C,(= 3R) for a constant-volume process and
using the same AT. Because we are dealing with a di-
atomic gas, let’s call this change AF, gig. Equation 19-45
gives us

In words, about 71% of the energy transferred to the gas
goes into the internal energy. The rest goes into the work re-
quired to increase the volume of the gas, as the gas pushes
the walls of its container outward.

Increases in K: If we were to increase the temperature of a
monatomic gas (with the same value of n) by the amount
given in Eq. 19-52, the internal energy would change by a
smaller amount, call it AE int, mon, because rotational motion
is not involved. To calculate that smaller amount, we still use
Eg. 19-45 but now we substitute the value of Cy for a
monatomic gas— namely, Cy = BR. So,

AE t,mon = 13R AT.
Substituting for AT from Eq. 19-52 leads us to

AE aaa = ni8(-2-) = 40

niR
= 0.428570 = 428.6 J.

For the monatomic gas, all this energy would go into the ki-
netic energy of the translational motion of the atoms. The im-
portant point here is that for a diatomic gas with the same
values of n and AT, the same amount of energy goes into the
kinetic energy of the translational motion of the molecules.
The rest of A Fig gia (that is, the additional 285.7 J) goes into the
rotational motion of the molecules. Thus, for the diatomic gas,

AK ans = 428.63 and AK,..=285.7J. (Answer)

Figure 19-44 Cy/R versus temperature for (diatomic) hydrogen
gas. Because rotational and oscillatory motions begin at cer-

tain energies, only translation is possible at very low tempera-
tures. As the temperature increases, rotational motion can be-
gin. At still higher temperatures, oscillatory motion can begin.

We can improve the agreement of kinetic theory with experiment by
including the oscillations of the atoms in a gas of diatomic or poly-
atomic molecules. For example, the two atoms in the O) molecule of
Fig. 19-13 can oscillate toward and away from each other, with the
interconnecting bond acting like a spring. However, experiment
shows that such oscillations occur only at relatively high tempera-
tures of the gas—the motion is “turned on” only when the gas mole-
cules have relatively large energies. Rotational motion is also sub-
ject to such “turning on,” but at a lower temperature.

Figure 19-14 is of help in seeing this turning on of rotational mo-
tion and oscillatory motion. The ratio Cy/R for diatomic hydrogen
gas (H)) is plotted there against temperature, with the temperature
scale logarithmic to cover several orders of magnitude. Below about
80 K, we find that Cy/R = 1.5. This result implies that only the three
translational degrees of freedom of hydrogen are involved in the
specific heat.
