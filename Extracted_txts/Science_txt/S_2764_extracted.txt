KEY IDEA

 

The temperature does not change in a free expansion be-
cause there is nothing to change the kinetic energy of the
molecules.

Calculation: Thus, the temperature is

 

 

Problem-Solving Tactics A Graphical Summary of Four Gas Processes

In this chapter we have discussed four special processes that
an ideal gas can undergo. An example of each (for a mon-
atomic ideal gas) is shown in Fig. 19-16, and some associated
characteristics are given in Table 19-4, including two process
names (isobaric and isochoric) that we have not used but
that you might see in other courses.

Review & Summary

Kinetic Theory of Gases The kinetic theory of gases relates
the macroscopic properties of gases (for example, pressure and
temperature) to the microscopic properties of gas molecules (for
example, speed and kinetic energy).

Avogadro’s Number One mole of a substance contains
Ns (Avogadro's number) elementary units (usually atoms or mole-
cules), where Nq is found experimentally to be

Na = 6.02 X 10? mol! (19-1)

(Avogadro’s number).

One molar mass M of any substance is the mass of one mole of the
substance. It is related to the mass m of the individual molecules of
the substance by

M=mNyg. (19-4)

The number of moles n contained in a sample of mass Myon.
consisting of N molecules, is given by
