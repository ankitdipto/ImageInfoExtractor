Ideal Gas An ideal gas is one for which the pressure p, volume

V, and temperature T are related by
pV =nRT (19-5)

Here nis the number of moles of the gas present and R is a constant
(8.31 J/mol-K) called the gas constant. The ideal gas law can also be

Molar Specific Heats The molar specific heat Cy of a gas at
constant volume is defined as
~ 2 _ AE in

in which Q is the energy transferred as heat to or from a sample of
n moles of the gas, AT is the resulting temperature change of the
gas, and AE;,, is the resulting change in the internal energy of the
gas. For an ideal monatomic gas,

in which Q,n,and AT are defined as above. C, is also given by
C= CytR. (19-49)
For n moles of an ideal gas,
Ei =nCyT (ideal gas). (19-44)

If moles of a confined ideal gas undergo a temperature change AT
due to any process, the change in the internal energy of the gas is

AE =nCy AT (ideal gas, any process). (19-45)
Degrees of Freedom and Cy The equipartition of energy
theorem states that every degree of freedom of a molecule has an
energy 3kT per molecule (= 3RT per mole). If f is the number of
degrees of freedom, then Eig = (f/2)nRT and

 

(£)e = 4.16f J/mol-K. (19-51)
For monatomic gases f = 3 (three translational degrees); for di-
atomic gases f = 5 (three translational and two rotational degrees).

Adiabatic Process When an ideal gas undergoes an adiabatic
volume change (a change for which Q = 0),

pV’ = aconstant (19-53)

(adiabatic process),

in which y(= C,/Cy) is the ratio of molar specific heats for the gas.
For a free expansion, however, pV = a constant.
