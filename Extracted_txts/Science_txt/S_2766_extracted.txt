gas requires 30 J when heated at constant volume and 50 J when
heated at constant pressure. How much work is done by the gas in
the second situation?

4 The dot in Fig. 19-18a represents the initial state of a gas, and
the vertical line through the dot divides the p-V diagram into re-
gions 1 and 2. For the following processes, determine whether the
work W done by the gas is positive, negative, or zero: (a) the gas
moves up along the vertical line, (b) it moves down along the verti-
cal line, (c) it moves to anywhere in region 1, and (d) it moves to
anywhere in region 2.

6 The dot in Fig. 19-18 represents the initial state of a gas, and
the isotherm through the dot divides the p-V diagram into regions
1 and 2. For the following processes, determine whether the change
AE;,, in the internal energy of the gas is positive, negative, or zero:
(a) the gas moves up along the isotherm, (b) it moves down along
the isotherm, (c) it moves to anywhere in region 1, and (d) it moves
to anywhere in region 2.

7 (a) Rank the four paths of Fig. 19-16 according to the work
done by the gas, greatest first. (b) Rank paths 1,2, and 3 according
to the change in the internal energy of the gas, most positive first
and most negative last.

8 The dot in Fig. 19-18c represents the initial state of a gas, and
the adiabat through the dot divides the p-V diagram into regions
1 and 2. For the following processes, determine whether the cor-
responding heat Q is positive, negative, or zero: (a) the gas
moves up along the adiabat, (b) it moves down along the adia-
bat, (c) it moves to anywhere in region 1, and (d) it moves to
anywhere in region 2.

9 An ideal diatomic gas, with molecular rotation but without any
molecular oscillation, loses a certain amount of energy as heat Q.
Is the resulting decrease in the internal energy of the gas greater if
the loss occurs in a constant-volume process or in a constant-pres-
sure process?

10 Does the temperature of an ideal gas increase, decrease,
or stay the same during (a) an isothermal expansion, (b) an expan-
sion at constant pressure, (c) an adiabatic expansion, and (d) an
increase in pressure at constant volume?
