pressure of the air in the tires when its temperature rises to 27.0°C
and its volume increases to 1.67 X 10-? m+? Assume atmospheric
pressure is 1.01 X 105 Pa.

°10 A container encloses 2 mol of an ideal gas that has molar
mass M, and 0.5 mol of a second ideal gas that has molar mass
M; = 3M,. What fraction of the total pressure on the container
wall is attributable to the second gas? (The kinetic theory explana-
tion of pressure leads to the experimentally discovered law of par-
tial pressures for a mixture of gases that do not react chemically:
The total pressure exerted by the mixture is equal to the sum of the
pressures that the several gases would exert separately if each were
to occupy the vessel alone. The molecule-vessel collisions of one
type would not be altered by the presence of another type.)

11 SsM ILW www Aijr that initially occupies 0.140 m3 at a
gauge pressure of 103.0 kPa is expanded isothermally to a pressure
of 101.3 kPa and then cooled at constant pressure until it reaches
its initial volume. Compute the work done by the air. (Gauge pres-
sure is the difference between the actual pressure and atmospheric
pressure.)

12 <e= © Submarine rescue. When the U.S. submarine
Squalus became disabled at a depth of 80 m, a cylindrical cham-
ber was lowered from a ship to rescue the crew. The chamber
had a radius of 1.00 m and a height of 4.00 m, was open at the
bottom, and held two rescuers. It slid along a guide cable that a
diver had attached to a hatch on the submarine. Once the cham-
ber reached the hatch and clamped to the hull, the crew could es-
cape into the chamber. During the descent, air was released from
tanks to prevent water from flooding the chamber. Assume that
the interior air pressure matched the water pressure at depth h
as given by po + pgh, where po = 1.000 atm is the surface pres-
sure and p= 1024 kg/m’ is the density of seawater. Assume a sur-
face temperature of 20.0°C and a submerged water temperature
of —30.0°C. (a) What is the air volume in the chamber at the sur-
face? (b) If air had not been released from the tanks, what would
have been the air volume in the chamber at depth h = 80.0 m?
(c) How many moles of air were needed to be released to main-
tain the original air volume in the

chamber?

sample? What are (b) the temperature Lo
of the gas at point b, (c) the tempera-
ture of the gas at point c, and (d) the
net energy added to the gas as heat
during the cycle?

certain nonideal gas is related to volume V and temperature T by

p = (24.9. /K) = = (0.00662 J/K2) =.

How much work is done by the gas if its temperature is raised from
315 K to 325 K while the pressure is held constant?

expansion as energy is added to it as heat Q. If Fig. 19-21 shows the
final volume V; versus Q, what is the gas temperature? The scale of

16 An air bubble of volume 20 cm’ is at the bottom of a lake
40 m deep, where the temperature is 4.0°C. The bubble rises to the
surface, which is at a temperature of 20°C. Take the temperature of
the bubble’s air to be the same as that of the surrounding water.
Just as the bubble reaches the surface, what is its volume?

017 @ Container A in Fig. 19-22
holds an ideal gas at a pressure of
5.0 X 105Pa and a temperature of
300 K. It is connected by a thin tube
(and a closed valve) to container B,
with four times the volume of A.
Container B holds the same ideal
gas at a pressure of 1.0 X 105 Pa and
a temperature of 400 K. The valve is
opened to allow the pressures to equalize, but the temperature of
each container is maintained. What then is the pressure?
