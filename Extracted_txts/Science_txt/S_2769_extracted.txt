Module 19-9 The Adiabatic Expansion of an Ideal Gas

°54 We know that for an adiabatic process pV’ = a constant.
Evaluate “a constant” for an adiabatic process involving exactly
2.0 mol of an ideal gas passing through the state having exactly
p =1.0atm and T = 300 K. Assume a diatomic gas whose mole-
cules rotate but do not oscillate.

to a volume of 0.76L. Determine (a) the final pressure and
(b) the final temperature, assuming the gas to be an ideal gas for
which y= 1.4.

pocket of gas (primarily carbon dioxide) between the liquid and
the cork is at pressure of p;=5.00 atm. When the cork is pulled
from the bottle, the gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion until its
pressure matches the ambient air pressure of 1.00 atm. Assume
that the ratio of the molar specific heats is y = 3. If the gas has
initial temperature T; = 5.00°C, what is its temperature at the end
of the adiabatic expansion?

  

+59 @ Figure 19-26 shows two paths that may be taken by a gas
from an initial point i to a final point f. Path 1 consists of an isother-
mal expansion (work is 50 J in magnitude), an adiabatic expansion
(work is 40J in magnitude), an isothermal compression (work is
30 J in magnitude), and then an adiabatic compression (work is 25 J
in magnitude). What is the change in the internal energy of the gas
if the gas goes from point i to point f along path 2?

60 @ <= Adiabatic wind. The normal airflow over the
Rocky Mountains is west to east. The air loses much of its moisture
content and is chilled as it climbs the western side of the moun-
tains. When it descends on the eastern side, the increase in pressure
toward lower altitudes causes the temperature to increase. The
flow, then called a chinook wind, can rapidly raise the air tempera-
ture at the base of the mountains. Assume that the air pressure p
depends on altitude y according to p = po exp (—ay), where po =
1.00 atm and a = 1.16 X 10-* m=. Also assume that the ratio of
the molar specific heats is y= 3. A parcel of air with an initial tem-
perature of —5.00°C descends adiabatically from y, = 4267 m to
y = 1567 m. What is its temperature at the end of the descent?

 

61 @ A gas is to be expanded from initial state / to final state f
along either path 1 or path 2 on a p-V diagram. Path 1 consists of
three steps: an isothermal expansion (work is 40 J in magnitude),
an adiabatic expansion (work is 20 J in magnitude), and another
isothermal expansion (work is 30 J in magnitude). Path 2 consists
of two steps: a pressure reduction at constant volume and an ex-
pansion at constant pressure. What is the change in the internal en-
ergy of the gas along path 2?
