and volume of 32 atm and 1.0L to a final volume of 4.0 L. The
initial temperature is 300 K. If the gas is monatomic and the expan-
sion isothermal, what are the (a) final pressure p;, (b) final temper-
ature T;, and (c) work W done by the gas? If the gas is monatomic
and the expansion adiabatic, what are (d) p,, (e) T;, and (f) W? If
the gas is diatomic and the expansion adiabatic, what are (g) p;,
(h) T;,and (i) W?

84 An ideal gas with 3.00 mol is initially in state 1 with pressure
P; = 20.0 atm and volume V, = 1500 cm’. First it is taken to state 2
with pressure p» = 1.50p; and volume V> = 2.00V;.Then itis taken
to state 3 with pressure p3; = 2.00p; and volume V3; = 0.500V;.
What is the temperature of the gas in (a) state 1 and (b) state 2?
(c) What is the net change in internal energy from state 1 to state 3?

85 A steel tank contains 300 g of ammonia gas (NH) at a pres-
sure of 1.35 X 10°Pa and a temperature of 77°C. (a) What is the
volume of the tank in liters? (b) Later the temperature is 22°C and
the pressure is 8.7 X 105 Pa. How many grams of gas have leaked
out of the tank?

86 In an industrial process the volume of 25.0 mol of a monatomic
ideal gas is reduced at a uniform rate from 0.616 m} to 0.308 m? in
2.00h while its temperature is increased at a uniform rate from
27.0°C to 450°C. Throughout the process, the gas passes through
thermodynamic equilibrium states. What are (a) the cumulative
work done on the gas, (b) the cumulative energy absorbed by the gas
as heat, and (c) the molar specific heat for the process? (Hint: To
evaluate the integral for the work, you might use

| AtBy" B Re nA + Bx)

an indefinite integral.) Suppose the process is replaced with a two-
step process that reaches the same final state. In step 1, the gas
volume is reduced at constant temperature, and in step 2 the tempera-
ture is increased at constant volume. For this process, what are (d) the
cumulative work done on the gas, (e) the cumulative energy absorbed
by the gas as heat, and (f) the molar specific heat for the process?

87 Figure 19-29 shows a cycle consisting of five paths: AB
is isothermal at 300 K, BCis adiabatic with work = 5.0 J, CD is ata
constant pressure of 5 atm, DE is isothermal, and EA is adiabatic
with a change in internal energy of 8.0 J. What is the change in in-
ternal energy of the gas along path CD?

88 An ideal gas initially at 300 K is compressed at a constant pres-
sure of 25 N/m? from a volume of 3.0 m* to a volume of 1.8 m*. In the
process, 75 Jis lost by the gas as heat. What are (a) the change in inter-
nal energy of the gas and (b) the final temperature of the gas?

89 A pipe of length L = 25.0 m thatis openat one end contains air
at atmospheric pressure. It is thrust vertically into a freshwater lake

until the water rises halfway
up in the pipe (Fig. 19-30).
What is the depth A of the
lower end of the pipe?
Assume that the temperature
is the same everywhere and
does not change.

90 Inamotorcycle engine, a
piston is forced down toward
the crankshaft when the fuel
in the top of the piston’s
cylinder undergoes combustion. The mixture of gaseous combus-
tion products then expands adiabatically as the piston descends.
Find the average power in (a) watts and (b) horsepower that is in-
volved in this expansion when the engine is running at 4000 rpm,
assuming that the gauge pressure immediately after combustion is
15 atm, the initial volume is 50 cm’, and the volume of the mixture
at the bottom of the stroke is 250 cm’. Assume that the gases are
diatomic and that the time involved in the expansion is one-half
that of the total cycle.

91 For adiabatic processes in an ideal gas, show that (a) the bulk
modulus is given by
dp

B= -Vi>= wp.

where y= G,/Cy. (See Eq. 17-2.) (b) Then show that the speed of

sound in the gas is
yp _ [RT
Pp M’

where p is the density, T is the temperature, and M is the molar
mass. (See Eq. 17-3.)

92 Air at0.000°C and 1.00 atm pressure has a density of 1.29 x 10-3
g/cm’, and the speed of sound is 331 m/s at that temperature.
Compute the ratio y of the molar specific heats of air. (Hint: See
Problem 91.)

93 The speed of sound in different gases at a certain tempera-
ture T depends on the molar mass of the gases. Show that

where v; is the speed of sound in a gas of molar mass M, and v3 is the
speed of sound in a gas of molarmass My. (Hint: See Problem 91.)

94 From the knowledge that Cy, the molar specific heat at con-
stant volume, for a gas in a container is 5.0R, calculate the ratio of
the speed of sound in that gas to the rms speed of the molecules,
for gas temperature T. (Hint: See Problem 91.)

95 The molar mass of iodine is 127 g/mol. When sound at fre-
quency 1000 Hz is introduced to a tube of iodine gas at 400 K, an
internal acoustic standing wave is set up with nodes separated by
9.57 cm. What is yfor the gas? (Hint: See Problem 91.)

96 For airnear 0°C, by how much does the speed of sound increase
for each increase in air temperature by 1 C°? (Hint: See Problem 91.)

97 Two containers are at the same temperature. The gas in the
first container is at pressure p,; and has molecules with mass m,
and root-mean-square speed V,,,.). The gas in the second is at pres-
sure 2p; and has molecules with mass m and average speed
