CHAPTER 20 ENTROPY AND THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.

Stirling Engine

Equation 20-13 applies not to all ideal engines but only to those that can be
represented as in Fig. 20-9— that is, to Carnot engines. For example, Fig. 20-13
shows the operating cycle of an ideal Stirling engine. Comparison with the
Carnot cycle of Fig. 20-9 shows that each engine has isothermal heat transfers
at temperatures Ty and 7,. However, the two isotherms of the Stirling engine
cycle are connected, not by adiabatic processes as for the Carnot engine but
by constant-volume processes. To increase the temperature of a gas at
constant volume reversibly from Ty, to Ty (process da of Fig. 20-13) requires a
transfer of energy as heat to the working substance from a thermal reservoir
whose temperature can be varied smoothly between those limits. Also, a re-
verse transfer is required in process bc. Thus, reversible heat transfers (and
corresponding entropy changes) occur in all four of the processes that form
the cycle of a Stirling engine, not just two processes as in a Carnot engine.
Thus, the derivation that led to Eq. 20-13 does not apply to an ideal Stirling en-
gine. More important, the efficiency of an ideal Stirling engine is lower than
that of a Carnot engine operating between the same two temperatures. Real
Stirling engines have even lower efficiencies.

The Stirling engine was developed in 1816 by Robert Stirling. This engine,
long neglected, is now being developed for use in automobiles and spacecraft.
A Stirling engine delivering 5000 hp (3.7 MW) has been built. Because they are
quiet, Stirling engines are used on some military submarines.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

Three Carnot engines operate between reservoir temperatures of (a) 400 and 500 K,
(b) 600 and 800 K, and (c) 400 and 600 K. Rank the engines according to their thermal
efficiencies, greatest first.

Sample Problem 20.03 Carnot engine, efficiency, power, entropy changes

Imagine a Carnot engine that operates between the temper-
atures Ty; = 850K and T;, = 300K. The engine performs
1200 J of work each cycle, which takes 0.25 s.

(a) What is the efficiency of this engine?
KEY IDEA

The efficiency ¢ of a Carnot engine depends only on the ratio
T,/T of the temperatures (in kelvins) of the thermal reser-
voirs to which it is connected.
Calculation: Thus, from Eq. 20-13, we have
T _ i= 300K
Ty 850K
(b) What is the average power of this engine?

= 0.647 ~ 65%. (Answer)

KEY IDEA

 

The average power P of an engine is the ratio of the work W
it does per cycle to the time f that each cycle takes.
Calculation: For this Carnot engine, we find

W _ 12005

P= = 025s

 

= 4800 W =4.8kW. (Answer)

(c) How much energy |Qj| is extracted as heat from the
high-temperature reservoir every cycle?

KEY IDEA

The efficiency « is the ratio of the work W that is done per
cycle to the energy |Q}| that is extracted as heat from the
high-temperature reservoir per cycle (e = W/IQy).

Calculation: Here we have
W _ 12005
Onl = = Oar
(d) How much energy !Q,! is delivered as heat to the low-
temperature reservoir every cycle?

 

= 1855J. (Answer)

KEY IDEA

For a Carnot engine, the work W done per cycle is equal to
the difference in the energy transfers as heat: |Qy! — |Qy|,as
in Eq. 20-8.
Calculation: Thus, we have

10,1 = 1041 — W

= 1855 J — 1200 J = 655 J. (Answer)
