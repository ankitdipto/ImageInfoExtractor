20-3 REFRIGERATORS AND REAL ENGINES

(e) By how much does the entropy of the working substance
change as a result of the energy transferred to it from the
high-temperature reservoir? From it to the low-temperature
reservoir?

KEY IDEA

The entropy change AS during a transfer of energy as heat Q at
constant temperature Tis given by Eq. 20-2 (AS = O/T).

Calculations: Thus, for the positive transfer of energy Qy
from the high-temperature reservoir at Ty, the change in the

Sample Problem 20.04

An inventor claims to have constructed an engine that has
an efficiency of 75% when operated between the boiling
and freezing points of water. Is this possible?

KEY IDEA

 

The efficiency of a real engine must be less than the effi-
ciency of a Carnot engine operating between the same two
temperatures.

entropy of the working substance is

_ On _ 18553
— Ty 850K

 

AS =+2.18J/K. (Answer)

Similarly, for the negative transfer of energy Q; to the
low-temperature reservoir at T,, we have
Q, — —655I

ASL = "= 300K

 

= —2.18J/K. (Answer)

Note that the net entropy change of the working substance for
one cycle is zero, as we discussed in deriving Eq. 20-10.

Impossibly efficient engine

Calculation: From Eq. 20-13, we find that the efficiency of a
Carnot engine operating between the boiling and freezing
points of water is

F__, __(0 +273) K

Ty (100 + 273) K
Thus, for the given temperatures, the claimed efficiency of
75% for a real engine (with its irreversible processes and
wasteful energy transfers) is impossible.

= 0.268 ~ 27%.

Learning Objectives

 

Atter reading this module, you should be able to...

20.16 Identify that a refrigerator is a device that uses work to
transfer energy from a low-temperature reservoir to a
high-temperature reservoir, and that an ideal refrigerator is
one that does this with reversible processes and no wasteful
losses.

20.17 Sketch a p-V diagram for the cycle of a Carnot refriger-
ator, indicating the direction of cycling, the nature of the
processes involved, the work done during each process
(including algebraic sign), the net work done in the cycle,

and the heat transferred during each process (including
algebraic sign).

20.18 Apply the relationship between the coefficient of
performance K and the heat exchanges with the reservoirs
and the temperatures of the reservoirs.

20.19 Identify that there is no ideal refrigerator in which all of
the energy extracted from the low-temperature reservoir is
transferred to the high-temperature reservoir.

20.20 Identify that the efficiency of a real engine is less
than that of the ideal Carnot engine.

@ A perfect refrigerator is an entirely imaginary refrigerator
in which energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature
reservoir is somehow converted completely to heat dis-
charged to the high-temperature reservoir without any

need for work.

@ A perfect refrigerator would violate the second law of
thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows: No se-
ries of processes is possible whose sole result is the trans-
fer of energy as heat from a reservoir at a given tempera-
ture to a reservoir at a higher temperature (without work
being involved).
