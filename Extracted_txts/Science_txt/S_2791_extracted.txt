Now, applying Eq. 20-22 to evaluate Eq. 20-23, we find that
S;= k1n(N!) — 2k In[(N/2)!]
= k[N(In N) — N] — 2k[(N/2) In(N/2) — (N/2)]
= k[N(InN) — N— N1n(N/2) + NJ
= k[N(In N) — N(In N — In 2)] = Nk In 2. (20-24)

From Eq. 19-8 we can substitute nR for Nk, where R is the
universal gas constant. Equation 20-24 then becomes

Sp=nRin2.

The change in entropy from the initial state to the final is

Review & Summary

One-Way Processes An irreversible process is one that can-
not be reversed by means of small changes in the environment. The
direction in which an irreversible process proceeds is set by the
change in entropy AS of the system undergoing the process.
Entropy S is a state property (or state function) of the system; that
is, it depends only on the state of the system and not on the way in
which the system reached that state. The entropy postulate states (in
part): If an irreversible process occurs in a closed system, the entropy
of the system always increases.

Calculating Entropy Change The entropy change AS for an
irreversible process that takes a system from an initial state i to a
final state f is exactly equal to the entropy change AS for any re-
versible process that takes the system between those same two
states. We can compute the latter (but not the former) with

'dO
as=s,-s= [82

Here Q is the energy transferred as heat to or from the system dur-
ing the process, and T is the temperature of the system in kelvins
during the process.

For a reversible isothermal process, Eq. 20-1 reduces to

AS = 5,~ 5 = =.
When the temperature change AT of a system is small relative to
the temperature (in kelvins) before and after the process, the en-
tropy change can be approximated as.

where T,,, is the system’s average temperature during the process.
When an ideal gas changes reversibly from an initial state with
temperature 7, and volume V, to a final state with temperature T;
and volume V;, the change AS in the entropy of the gas is

which is what we set out to show. In the first sample prob-
lem of this chapter we calculated this entropy increase for
a free expansion with thermodynamics by finding an
equivalent reversible process and calculating the entropy
change for that process in terms of temperature and heat
transfer. In this sample problem, we calculate the same in-
crease in entropy with statistical mechanics using the fact
that the system consists of molecules. In short, the two,
very different approaches give the same answer.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics This law, which is
an extension of the entropy postulate, states: [fa process occurs in
a closed system, the entropy of the system increases for irreversible
processes and remains constant for reversible processes. It never de-
creases. In equation form,

AsS=0. (20-5)

Engines An engine is a device that, operating in a cycle, extracts
energy as heat |Q,| from a high-temperature reservoir and does a cer-
tain amount of work |WI.The efficiency e of any engine is defined as

energy we get __—-|W|

In an ideal engine, all processes are reversible and no wasteful energy

transfers occur due to, say, friction and turbulence. A Carnot engine is

an ideal engine that follows the cycle of Fig. 20-9. Its efficiency is

in which Ty and 7, are the temperatures of the high- and low-
temperature reservoirs, respectively. Real engines always have an
efficiency lower than that given by Eq. 20-13. Ideal engines that are
not Carnot engines also have lower efficiencies.

A perfect engine is an imaginary engine in which energy ex-
tracted as heat from the high-temperature reservoir is converted com-
pletely to work. Such an engine would violate the second law of ther-
modynamics, which can be restated as follows: No series of processes
is possible whose sole result is the absorption of energy as heat froma
thermal reservoir and the complete conversion of this energy to work.

Refrigerators A refrigerator is a device that, operating in a cy-
cle, has work W done on it as it extracts energy |Q,| as heat froma
low-temperature reservoir. The coefficient of performance K of a
refrigerator is defined as
