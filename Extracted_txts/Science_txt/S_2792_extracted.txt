A perfect refrigerator is an imaginary refrigerator in which
energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature reservoir is con-
verted completely to heat discharged to the high-temperature reser-
voir, without any need for work. Such a refrigerator would violate
the second law of thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows:
No series of processes is possible whose sole result is the transfer of
energy as heat from a reservoir at a given temperature to a reservoir
at a higher temperature.

Entropy from a Statistical View The entropy of a system can
be defined in terms of the possible distributions of its molecules. For
identical molecules, each possible distribution of molecules is called a
microstate of the system. All equivalent microstates are grouped into

2 In four experiments, blocks A
and B, starting at different initial
temperatures, were brought together in an insulating box and al-
lowed to reach a common final temperature. The entropy changes
for the blocks in the four experiments had the following values (in
joules per kelvin), but not necessarily in the order given.
Determine which values for A go with which values for B.

B —3 -8 —S —2

3 A gas, confined to an insulated cylinder, is compressed
adiabatically to half its volume. Does the entropy of the gas
increase, decrease, or remain unchanged during this process?

a configuration of the system. The number of microstates in a config-
uration is the multiplicity W of the configuration.

For a system of N molecules that may be distributed between
the two halves of a box, the multiplicity is given by

in which 7, is the number of molecules in one half of the box and ny is,
the number in the other half. A basic assumption of statistical
mechanics is that all the microstates are equally probable. Thus, con-
figurations with a large multiplicity occur most often.

The multiplicity W of a configuration of a system and the en-
tropy S of the system in that configuration are related by
Boltzmann’s entropy equation:

6 A box contains 100 atoms in a configuration that has
50 atoms in each half of the box. Suppose that you could count
the different microstates associated with this configuration at the
rate of 100 billion states per second, using a supercomputer.
Without written calculation, guess how much computing time
you would need: a day, a year, or much more than a year.

7 Does the entropy per cycle increase, decrease, or remain the
same for (a) a Carnot engine, (b) a real engine, and (c) a perfect
engine (which is, of course, impossible to build)?

8 Three Carnot engines operate between temperature limits of
(a) 400 and 500 K, (b) 500 and 600 K, and (c) 400 and 600 K. Each
engine extracts the same amount of energy per cycle from the
high-temperature reservoir. Rank the magnitudes of the work
done by the engines per cycle, greatest first.

9 An inventor claims to have invented four engines, each of which
operates between constant-temperature reservoirs at 400 and 300 K.
Data on each engine, per cycle of operation, are: engine A, Q,, = 200
JQ, = —175 Sand W = 40J; engine B, Q,; = 500 J,Q; = —200 and
W = 400J; engine C, Q,; = 600 J,Q; = —200 Jand W = 400 J; engine
D,Qy = 100J,Q,; = —90J,and W = 10J. Of the first and second laws
of thermodynamics, which (if either) does each engine violate?
