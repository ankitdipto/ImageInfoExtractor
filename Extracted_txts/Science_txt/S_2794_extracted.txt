+19 Suppose 1.00 mol of a monatomic ideal gas is taken from ini-
tial pressure p; and volume V, through two steps: (1) an isothermal
expansion to volume 2.00V; and (2) a pressure increase to 2.00p; at
constant volume. What is Q/p,V; for (a) step 1 and (b) step 2? What
is Wip,V; for (c) step 1 and (d) step 2? For the full process, what are
(e) AE,,/p,V; and (f) AS? The gas is returned to its initial state and
again taken to the same final state but now through these two steps:
(1) an isothermal compression to pressure 2.00p; and (2) a volume
increase to 2.00V, at constant pressure. What is Q/p,V, for (g) step 1
and (h) step 2? What is W/p,V, for (i) step 1 and (j) step 2? For the
full process, what are (k) AFjq/p1V; and (1) AS?

+20 Expand 1.00 mol of an monatomic gas initially at 5.00 kPa
and 600 K from initial volume V; = 1.00 to final volume V; =
2.00 m’. At any instant during the expansion, the pressure p and vol-
ume V of the gas are related by p = 5.00 exp[(V; — V)/a], with p in
kilopascals, V; and V in cubic meters, and a = 1.00 m>. What are the
final (a) pressure and (b) temperature of the gas? (c) How much
work is done by the gas during the expansion? (d) What is AS for the
expansion? (Hint: Use two simple reversible processes to find AS.)

 

«21 @ <== Energy can be removed from water as heat at
and even below the normal freezing point (0.0°C at atmospheric
pressure) without causing the water to freeze; the water is then
said to be supercooled. Suppose a 1.00 g water drop is super-
cooled until its temperature is that of the surrounding air, which
is at —5.00°C. The drop then suddenly and irreversibly freezes,
transferring energy to the air as heat. What is the entropy change
for the drop? (Hint: Use a three-step reversible process as if the
water were taken through the normal freezing point.) The spe-
cific heat of ice is 2220 J/kg: K.
