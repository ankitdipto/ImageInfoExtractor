°47 ssm www A box contains N gas molecules. Consider
the box to be divided into three equal parts. (a) By extension of
Eq. 20-20, write a formula for the multiplicity of any given configu-
ration. (b) Consider two configurations: configuration A with
equal numbers of molecules in all three thirds of the box, and con-
figuration B with equal numbers of molecules in each half of the
box divided into two equal parts rather than three. What is the ra-
tio W,/W, of the multiplicity of configuration A to that of configu-
ration B? (c) Evaluate W,/W, for N = 100. (Because 100 is not
evenly divisible by 3, put 34 molecules into one of the three box
parts of configuration A and 33 in each of the other two parts.)

51 ssm Asa sample of nitrogen gas (N)) undergoes a tempera-
ture increase at constant volume, the distribution of molecular
speeds increases. That is, the probability distribution function P(v)
for the molecules spreads to higher speed values, as suggested in
Fig. 19-8. One way to report the spread in P(v) is to measure the
difference Av between the most probable speed vp and the rms
speed Vim When P(v) spreads to higher speeds, Av increases.
