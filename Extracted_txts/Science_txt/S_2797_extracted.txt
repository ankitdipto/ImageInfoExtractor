per cycle required by the ideal refrigerator. Treat this combination
as a single unit and show that if the inventor's claim were true (if
ex > e), the combined unit would act as a perfect refrigerator
(Fig. 20-345), transferring energy as heat from the low-tempera-
ture reservoir to the high-temperature reservoir without the need
for work.

What is the change AF jn for (g) path 1 > 2,(h) path2 3, and
(i) the full cycle? (Hint: (h) can be done with one or two lines of cal-
culation using Module 19-7 or with a page of calculation using
Module 19-9.) (j) What is the work W for the adiabatic process?

63 A three-step cycle is undergone reversibly by 4.00 mol of an ideal
gas: (1) an adiabatic expansion that gives the gas 2.00 times its initial
volume, (2) a constant-volume process, (3) an isothermal compression
back to the initial state of the gas. We do not know whether the gas is
monatomic or diatomic; if it is diatomic, we do not know whether the
molecules are rotating or oscillating. What are the entropy changes for
(a) the cycle,(b) process 1, (c) process 3, and (d) process 2?

64 (a) A Carnot engine operates between a hot reservoir at
320 K and a cold one at 260 K. If the engine absorbs 500 J as heat
per cycle at the hot reservoir, how much work per cycle does it
deliver? (b) If the engine working in reverse functions as a refrig-
erator between the same two reservoirs, how much work per cy-
cle must be supplied to remove 1000J as heat from the cold
reservoir?

 

65 A 2.00 mol diatomic gas initially at 300K undergoes this
cycle: It is (1) heated at constant volume to 800 K, (2) then allowed
to expand isothermally to its initial pressure, (3) then compressed
at constant pressure to its initial state. Assuming the gas molecules
neither rotate nor oscillate, find (a) the net energy transferred as
heat to the gas, (b) the net work done by the gas, and (c) the effi-
ciency of the cycle.

66 An ideal refrigerator does 150 J of work to remove 560 J as
heat from its cold compartment. (a) What is the refrigerator’s coef-
ficient of performance? (b) How much heat per cycle is exhausted

67 Suppose that 260 J is conducted from a constant-temperature
reservoir at 400 K to one at (a) 100K, (b) 200 K, (c) 300K, and
(d) 360 K. What is the net change in entropy AS,.: of the reservoirs
in each case? (e) As the temperature difference of the two reser-
voirs decreases, does AS,., increase, decrease, or remain the same?

68 An apparatus that liquefies helium is in a room maintained at
300K. If the helium in the apparatus is at 4.0K, what is the
