616 CHAPTER 21 COULOMB’S LAW

Sample Problem 21.01

This sample problem actually contains three examples, to
build from basic stuff to harder stuff. In each we have the
same charged particle 1. First there is a single force acting
on it (easy stuff). Then there are two forces, but they are just
in opposite directions (not too bad). Then there are again
two forces but they are in very different directions (ah, now
we have to get serious about the fact that they are vectors).
The key to all three examples is to draw the forces correctly
before you reach for a calculator, otherwise you may be cal-
culating nonsense on the calculator. (Figure 21-7 is available
in Wiley PLUS as an animation with voiceover.)

(a) Figure 21-7a shows two positively charged particles fixed in
place on an x axis The charges are q, = 1.60 x 10°C and
qp = 3.20 x 107°C, and the particle separation is R = 0.0200 m.
‘What are the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force
F,0n particle 1 from particle 2?

KEY IDEAS

 

Because both particles are positively charged, particle 1 is re-
pelled by particle 2, with a force magnitude given by Eq. 21-4.
Thus, the direction of force F, on particle 1 is away from parti-
cle 2, in the negative direction of the x axis, as indicated in the
free-body diagram of Fig. 21-7b.

Two particles: Using Eq. 21-4 with separation R substituted
for r, we can write the magnitude F,, of this force as

Thus, force Fi has the following magnitude and direction
(relative to the positive direction of the x axis):

‘We can also write Fy in unit-vector notation as
Fy = —(1.15 x 10- N)i. (Answer)

(b) Figure 21-7c is identical to Fig.21-7a except that particle 3
now lies on the x axis between particles 1 and 2. Particle 3
has charge q3 = —3.20 x 10° C and is at a distance 3R from
particle 1. What is the net electrostatic force F; ,., on particle 1
due to particles 2 and 3?

KEY IDEA

 

The presence of particle 3 does not alter the electrostatic force
on particle 1 from particle 2. Thus, force F,, still acts on particle
1. Similarly, the force F,; that acts on particle 1 due to particle 3
is not affected by the presence of particle 2. Because particles 1
