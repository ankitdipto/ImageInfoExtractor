and 3 have charge of opposite signs, particle 1 is attracted
to particle 3. Thus, force F;; is directed toward particle 3, as in-
dicated in the free-body diagram of Fig. 21-7d.

Three particles: To find the magnitude of Fy, we can
rewrite Eq. 21-4 as

1 _laillasl
GRY
= (8.99 x 10°N-m2/C?)
(1.60 x 10-19 C)(3.20 x 10-9 C)
(0.0200 my?
= 205 << 10 N,

We can also write F'; in unit-vector notation:

Tcl

Fi; = (2.05 x 104 N)i.

The net force TPA ct on particle 1 is the vector sum of igi
and Fy; that is, from Eq. 21-7, we can write the net force
en on particle 1 in unit-vector notation as

Foe = Fin + Fis
—(1.15 x 10-4N)i + (2.05 x 10-4 N)i
(9.00 x 10-2 N)i. (Answer)

Thus, F;, get has the following magnitude and direction (relative
to the positive direction of the x axis):

9.00 x10°N and 0°. (Answer)

(c) Figure 21-7e is identical to Fig. 21-7a except that particle 4
is now included. It has charge gy = —3.20 X 10°" C, is at a
distance 3R from particle 1, and lies on a line that makes an
angle @= 60° with the x axis. What is the net electrostatic
force IP on particle 1 due to particles 2 and 4?

KEY IDEA

 

The net force Par is the vector sum of ie and a new force
F,,4 acting on particle 1 due to particle 4. Because particles 1
and 4 have charge of opposite signs, particle 1 is attracted to
particle 4. Thus, force Fi, on particle 1 is directed toward
particle 4, at angle @ = 60°, as indicated in the free-body dia-
gram of Fig.21-7f.

Four particles: We can rewrite Eq.21-4 as

Then from Eq. 21-7, we can write the net force Fy. on parti-

cle 1 as
F get = Fin + Fos.

Because the forces ay and Fy are not directed along the
same axis, we cannot sum simply by combining their mag-
nitudes. Instead, we must add them as vectors, using one of
the following methods.

Method 1. Summing directly on a vector- conde calculator.
For Fi, we enter the magnitude 1.15 x 10™ and the angle
180°. For Fi,, we enter the magnitude 2.05 x 10-* and the
angle 60°.Then we add the vectors.

Method 2. Summing in unit-vector notation. First we
rewrite 1a as
a = (F,4 cos Oi + (Fig sin 0).
Substituting 2.05 x 10-™ N for F,, and 60° for 6, this becomes
Fi, = (1.025 x 10-*N)i + (1.775 x 10-4 Nj.
Then we sum:
Foe = Fo + Fu
= (115 x 10-4N)i
+ (1.025 x 10-4N)i + (1.775 x 10-4N)j
= (-1.25 x 10-N)i + (1.78 x 10-4N)j.
(Answer)

Method 3. Summing components axis by axis. The sum of
the x components gives us

Froax = Fix + Prax = Fin + Fiscos 60°
= —1.15 x 104 N + (2.05 x 10-*N)(cos 60°)
=-125x 10 3N.
The sum of the y components gives us
Fraey = Fray + Fy = 0 + Fygsin 60°
= (2.05 x 10-™ N)(sin 60°)
= 1.78 x 10-*N.

 

The net force eer has the magnitude
Figet = VFhnctx + Fnay = 1.78 X 10-*N.

To find the direction of F nets We take

(Answer)

Fr nety
@= tan !—** =
‘net,

—86.0°.

However, this is an unreasonable result because F,, net, must
have a direction between the directions of Pen and Fa. To
correct @,we add 180°, obtaining

—86.0° + 180° = 94.0°. (Answer)
