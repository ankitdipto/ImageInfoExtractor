2 Figure 21-12 shows three pairs of identical spheres that are to
be touched together and then separated. The initial charges on them
are indicated. Rank the pairs according to (a) the magnitude of the
charge transferred during touching and (b) the charge left on the

positively charged sphere, greatest first.

fixed in place on an axis. In which situations is there a point to the left
of the particles where an electron will be in equilibrium?

charged particle can be placed at a

certain point such that all three particles are then in equilibrium. (a) Is
that point to the left of the first two +49

positively or negatively charged? (c)
Is the equilibrium stable or unstable?

   

5 In Fig. 21-15, a central particle of
charge —q is surrounded by two cir-
cular rings of charged particles. What
are the magnitude and direction of
the net electrostatic force on the cen-
tral particle due to the other parti-
cles? (Hint: Consider symmetry.)

cle and a uniformly charged spherical shell. The charges are given,
and the radii of the shells are indicated. Rank the situations ac-
cording to the magnitude of the force on the particle due to the
presence of the shell, greatest first.
