*2 Identical isolated conducting spheres 1 and 2 have equal
charges and are separated by a distance that is large compared with
their diameters (Fig. 21-22a). The electrostatic force acting on
sphere 2 due to sphere 1 is F. Suppose now that a third identical
sphere 3, having an insulating handle and initially neutral, is
touched first to sphere 1 (Fig. 21-225), then to sphere 2 (Fig. 21-22c),
and finally removed (Fig. 21-22d). The electrostatic force that now
acts on sphere 2 has magnitude F'. What is the ratio F'/F?

+8 In Fig. 21-24, three identical conducting spheres initially have
the following charges: sphere A, 4Q; sphere B, —6Q; and sphere
C, 0. Spheres A and B are fixed in place, with a center-to-center
separation that is much larger than the spheres. Two experiments
are conducted. In experiment 1, k
sphere C is touched to sphere A
and then (separately) to sphere B,
and then it is removed. In experi-
ment 2, starting with the same
initial states, the procedure is re-
versed: Sphere C is touched to
sphere B and then (separately) to
sphere A, and then it is removed.
