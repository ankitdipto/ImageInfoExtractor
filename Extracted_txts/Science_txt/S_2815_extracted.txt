particles separated by distance d. Particles A and C are fixed on
the x axis, but particle B can be moved along a circle centered on
particle A. During the movement, a radial line between A and B
makes an angle @ relative to the positive direction of the x axis
(Fig. 21-30b). The curves in Fig. 21-30c give, for two situations, the
magnitude F,,. of the net electrostatic force on particle A due to the
other particles. That net force is given as a function of angle @and as
a multiple of a basic amount F). For example on curve 1, at @ = 180°,
