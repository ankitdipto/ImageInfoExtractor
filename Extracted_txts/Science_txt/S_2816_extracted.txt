and ys = 5.00 cm. Particles 1 and 3, of charge —e, can be moved
along the x axis. Particle 5, of charge +e, is fixed at the origin.
Initially particle 1 is at x; = —10.0 cm and particle 3 is at x; = 10.0
cm. (a) To what x value must particle 1 be moved to rotate the
direction of the net electric force F,.: on particle 5 by 30° counter-
clockwise? (b) With particle 1 fixed at its new position, to what x
value must you move particle 3 to rotate F,,, back to its original
direction?

+30 In Fig,21-26, particles 1 and 2are fixed in place on an x axis, at a
separation of L = 8,00cm. Their charges are q; = +e and q, = —27e.
Particle 3 with charge q; = +4e is to be placed on the line between
particles 1 and 2, so that they produce a net electrostatic force Fy,,., 00
it. (a) At what coordinate should particle 3 be placed to minimize the
magnitude of that force? (b) What is that minimum magnitude?

31 ILw Earth’s atmosphere is constantly bombarded by cosmic
ray protons that originate somewhere in space. If the protons all
passed through the atmosphere, each square meter of Earth’s sur-
face would intercept protons at the average rate of 1500 protons
per second. What would be the electric current intercepted by the
total surface area of the planet?

32) @ Figure 21-34a shows charged particles 1 and 2 that are
fixed in place on an x axis. Particle 1 has a charge with a magnitude
of Iqil = 8.00e. Particle 3 of charge q; = +8.00e is initially on the x
axis near particle 2. Then particle 3 is gradually moved in the posi-
tive direction of the x axis. As a result, the magnitude of the net
electrostatic force Fy. on particle 2 due to particles 1 and 3
changes. Figure 21-34b gives the x component of that net force as a
function of the position x of particle 3. The scale of the x axis is set
by x, = 0.80 m. The plot has an asymptote of F),., = 1.5 X 10° N
as x > %, As a multiple of ¢ and including the sign, what is the
charge q2 of particle 2?

**35 ssm In crystals of the salt cesium chloride, cesium ions
Cs* form the eight corners of a cube and a chlorine ion Cl- is at the
cube’s center (Fig. 21-36). The edge length of the cube is 0.40 nm.
The Cs* ions are each deficient by one electron (and thus each has
a charge of +e), and the Cl- ion has one excess electron (and thus
has a charge of —e). (a) What is the magnitude of the net electro-
static force exerted on the Cl ion by the eight Cs* ions at the cor-
ners of the cube? (b) If one of the Cs~ ions is missing, the crystal is
said to have a defect; what is the magnitude of the net electrostatic
force exerted on the Cl” ion by the seven remaining Cs* ions?

Sphere W (with an initial charge of
zero) is touched to sphere A and then
they are separated. Next, sphere W is
