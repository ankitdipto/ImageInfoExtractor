628 CHAPTER 21 COULOMB'S LAW

42 In Fig. 21-39, two tiny conducting
balls of identical mass m and identical
charge q hang from nonconducting
threads of length L. Assume that @is so
small that tan @ can be replaced by its
approximate equal, sin 6. (a) Show that

+= (8

gives the equilibrium separation x of
the balls. (b) If L = 120 cm,m = 10g,
and x = 5.0 cm, what is |qi?

  

43 (a) Explain what happens to the
balls of Problem 42 if one of them is
discharged (loses its charge q to, say,
the ground). (b) Find the new equilibrium separation x, using the
given values of L and m and the computed value of Iql.

44 SSM How far apart must two protons be if the magnitude of the
electrostatic force acting on either one due to the other is equal to the
magnitude of the gravitational force on a proton at Earth’s surface?

45 How many megacoulombs of positive charge are in 1.00 mol
of neutral molecular-hydrogen gas (Hp)?

fixed along an x axis, separated by “[ 3 ~~~
distances d = 2.00 cm. The charges

are qi = +2e, qo =e, q3= +e, Figure 21-40 Problem 46.

on (a) particle 1 and (b) particle 2 due to the other particles?

47@ Point charges of +6.0 wC and —4.0 uC are placed on an
X axis, at x = 8.0m and x = 16 m, respectively. What charge must
be placed at x = 24 m so that any charge placed at the origin would

experience no electrostatic force?

ducting spheres form an equilateral tri-
angle of side length d=20.0cm. The
sphere radii are much smaller than d,
and the sphere charges are g, = —2.00
nC, qx = —4.00nC, and ge = +8.00 nC.

The following steps are then taken: A Problem 48.

and B are connected by a thin wire and

then disconnected; B is grounded by the wire, and the wire is then
removed; B and C are connected by the wire and then discon-
nected. What now are the magnitudes of the electrostatic force (b)
between spheres A and C and (c) between spheres B and C?

49 A neutron consists of one “up” quark of charge +2e/3 and two
“down” quarks each having charge —e/3. If we assume that the down
quarks are 2.6 X 10~' m apart inside the neutron, what is the magni-
tude of the electrostatic force between them?

50 Figure 21-42 shows a long, nonconducting, massless rod of
length L, pivoted at its center and balanced with a block of
weight W at a distance x from the left end. At the left and right
ends of the rod are attached small conducting spheres with posi-
tive charges q and 2g, respectively. A distance h directly beneath
each of these spheres is a fixed sphere with positive charge Q. (a)
Find the distance x when the rod is horizontal and balanced. (b)

What value should / have so that the rod exerts no vertical force on
the bearing when the rod is horizontal and balanced?

51. A charged nonconducting rod, with a length of 2.00 m and a
cross-sectional area of 4.00 cm’, lies along the positive side of an x
axis with one end at the origin. The volume charge density p is
charge per unit volume in coulombs per cubic meter. How many
excess electrons are on the rod if p is (a) uniform, with a value of
—4,00 »C/m*, and (b) nonuniform, with a value given by p = bx?,
where b = —2.00 wC/m5?

52 A particle of charge Q is fixed at the origin of an xy coordi-
nate system. At t= 0 a particle (m = 0.800 g, g = 4.00 uC) is lo-
cated on the x axis at x = 20.0 cm, moving with a speed of 50.0 m/s
in the positive y direction. For what value of Q will the moving par-
ticle execute circular motion? (Neglect the gravitational force on
the particle.)

53 What would be the magnitude of the electrostatic force be-
tween two 1.00 C point charges separated by a distance of (a) 1.00 m
and (b) 1.00 km if such point charges existed (they do not) and this
configuration could be set up?

54 A charge of 6.0 uC is to be split into two parts that are then
separated by 3.0 mm. What is the maximum possible magnitude of
the electrostatic force between those two parts?

55) /Of the charge Q ona tiny sphere, a fraction a is to be trans-
ferred to a second, nearby sphere. The spheres can be treated as
particles. (a) What value of amaximizes the magnitude F of the elec-
trostatic force between the two spheres? What are the (b) smaller
and (c) larger values of e that put F at half the maximum magnitude?

56 <== If a cat repeatedly rubs against your cotton slacks on a
dry day, the charge transfer between the cat hair and the cotton can
leave you with an excess charge of —2.00 uC. (a) How many elec-
trons are transferred between you and the cat?

You will gradually discharge via the floor, but if instead of
waiting, you immediately reach toward a faucet, a painful spark
can suddenly appear as your fingers near the faucet. (b) In that
spark, do electrons flow from you to the faucet or vice versa?
(c) Just before the spark appears, do you induce positive or nega-
tive charge in the faucet? (d) If, instead, the cat reaches a paw
toward the faucet, which way do electrons flow in the resulting
spark? (e) If you stroke a cat with a bare hand on a dry day, you
should take care not to bring your fingers near the cat’s nose or
you will hurt it with a spark. Considering that cat hair is an insula-
tor, explain how the spark can appear.

57) We know that the negative charge on the electron and the
positive charge on the proton are equal. Suppose, however, that
these magnitudes differ from each other by 0.00010%. With what
force would two copper coins, placed 1.0 m apart, repel each other?
Assume that each coin contains 3 x 10” copper atoms. (Hint: A
neutral copper atom contains 29 protons and 29 electrons.) What
do you conclude?
