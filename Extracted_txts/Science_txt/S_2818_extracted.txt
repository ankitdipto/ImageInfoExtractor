axis, at the origin and at x = 72 cm, respectively. A particle with a

65 The initial charges on the three identical metal spheres in
Fig. 21-24 are the following: sphere A, Q; sphere B, —Q/4; and
sphere C, Q/2, where Q = 2.00 X 10-*C. Spheres A and B are
fixed in place, with a center-to-center separation of d= 1.20 m,
which is much larger than the spheres. Sphere C is touched first to
sphere A and then to sphere B and is then removed. What then is
the magnitude of the electrostatic force between spheres A and B?

balance in the amount of positive and negative charge, one student
being positive and the other negative. Find the order of magnitude of
the electrostatic force of attraction between them by replacing each
student with a sphere of water having the same mass as the student.

69 In the radioactive decay of Eq. 21-13, a ?*U nucleus transforms

electrons are not involved.) When the separation between ™Th and
“He is 9.0 X 10-5 m, what are the magnitudes of (a) the electrostatic
force between them and (b) the acceleration of the “He particle?

71 Inaspherical metal shell of radius R, an electron is shot from
the center directly toward a tiny hole in the shell, through which it
escapes. The shell is negatively charged with a surface charge den-
sity (charge per unit area) of 6.90 X 10-5 C/m?. What is the magni-

72 Anelectron is projected with an initial speed v; = 3.2 X 10 m/s
directly toward a very distant proton that is at rest. Because the
proton mass is large relative to the electron mass, assume that the
proton remains at rest. By calculating the work done on the elec-
tron by the electrostatic force, determine the distance between the
two particles when the electron instantaneously has speed 2v,.

crease, or stay the same?
