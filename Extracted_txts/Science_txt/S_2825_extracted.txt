tric field vectors E,,, and E(_, at point P on
the dipole axis result from the dipole’s two
charges. Point P is at distances r,.) and r_)

The Electric Field Due to an Electric Dipole

Figure 22-8 shows the pattern of electric field lines for two particles that have
the same charge magnitude gq but opposite signs, a very common and important
arrangement known as an electric dipole. The particles are separated by dis-
tance d and lie along the dipole axis, an axis of symmetry around which you can
imagine rotating the pattern in Fig. 22-8. Let’s label that axis as a z axis. Here
we restrict our interest to the magnitude and direction of the electric field Eat
an arbitrary point P along the dipole axis, at distance z from the dipole’s
midpoint.

Figure 22-9a shows the electric fields set up at P by each particle. The nearer
particle with charge +g sets up field E,,) in the positive direction of the z axis (di-
rectly away from the particle). The farther particle with charge —q sets up a
smaller field E,_) in the negative direction (directly toward the particle). We want
the net field at P, as given by Eq. 22-4. However, because the field vectors are
along the same axis, let’s simply indicate the vector directions with plus and mi-
nus signs, as we commonly do with forces along a single axis. Then we can write
the magnitude of the net field at P as

We are usually interested in the electrical effect of a dipole only at distances
that are large compared with the dimensions of the dipole—that is, at distances such
that z > d.At such large distances, we have d/2z < 1 in Eq. 22-7. Thus, in our approx-
imation, we can neglect the d/2z term in the denominator, which leaves us with

The product qd, which involves the two intrinsic properties g and d of the
dipole, is the magnitude p of a vector quantity known as the electric dipole moment
P of the dipole. (The unit of p is the coulomb-meter.) Thus, we can write Eq. 22-8 as

i= == (clectric dipole). (22-9)

The direction of p is taken to be from the negative to the positive end of the
dipole, as indicated in Fig. 22-9b. We can use the direction of p to specify the
orientation of a dipole.

Equation 22-9 shows that, if we measure the electric field of a dipole only at
distant points, we can never find q and d separately; instead, we can find only
their product. The field at distant points would be unchanged if, for example, q
