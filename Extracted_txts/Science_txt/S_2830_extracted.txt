22-4 THE ELECTRIC FIELD DUE TO A LINE OF CHARGE

Sample Problem 22.03 Electric field of a charged circular rod

Figure 22-13a shows a plastic rod with a uniform charge
—@Q. It is bent in a 120° circular arc of radius r and symmet-
rically paced across an x axis with the origin at the center of
curvature P of the rod. In terms of Q and r, what is the elec-
tric field E due to the rod at point P?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the rod has a continuous charge distribution, we must
find an expression for the electric fields due to differential ele-
ments of the rod and then sum those fields via calculus.

An element: Consider a differential element having arc
length ds and located at an angle 6 above the x axis (Figs.
22-13b and c). If we let A represent the linear charge density of
the rod, our element ds has a differential charge of magnitude

dq = Ads. (22-18)

The element's field: Our element produces a differential
electric field dE at point P, which is a distance r from the
element. Treating the element as a point charge, we can

But we can treat this
element as a particle.

This negatively charged rod
is obviously not a particle.

rewrite Eq. 22-3 to express the magnitude of dE as

The direction of dE is toward ds because charge dq is negative.

dE =

 

 

 

(22-19)

Symmetric partner: Our element has a symmetrically
located (mirror image) element ds’ in the bottom half of the
rod. The electric field dE’ set up at P by ds’ also has the
magnitude given by Eq. 22-19, but the field vector points to-
ward ds’ as shown in Fig. 22-13d. If we resolve the electric
field vectors of ds and ds' into x and y components as shown
in Figs. 22-13e and f, we see that their y components cancel
(because they have equal magnitudes and are in opposite
directions). We also see that their x components have equal
magnitudes and are in the same direction.

Summing: Thus, to find the electric field set up by the rod,
we need sum (via integration) only the x components of the
differential electric fields set up by all the differential ele-
ments of the rod. From Fig. 22-13fand Eq. 22-19, we can write
