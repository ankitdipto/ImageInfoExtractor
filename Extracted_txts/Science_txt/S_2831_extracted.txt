dE, = dE cos @= geen Ods.

Equation 22-20 has two variables, @ and s. Before we can
integrate it, we must eliminate one variable. We do so by
replacing ds, using the relation
ds = rd,

in which d@ is the angle at P that includes arc length ds
(Fig. 22-13g). With this replacement, we can integrate
Eq. 22-20 over the angle made by the rod at P, from @ = —60'
to @ = 60°; that will give us the field magnitude at P:

(If we had reversed the limits on the integration, we would
have gotten the same result but with a minus sign. Since the
integration gives only the magnitude of E, we would then
have discarded the minus sign.)

Charge density: To evaluate A, we note that the full rod
subtends an angle of 120° and so is one-third of a full circle.
Its arc length is then 2277/3, and its linear charge density
must be

Problem-Solving Tactics A Field Guide for Lines of Charge

Here is a generic guide for finding the electric field E pro-
duced at a point P by a line of uniform charge, either circu-
lar or straight. The general strategy is to pick out an element
dq of the charge, find dE due to that element, and integrate
dE over the entire line of charge.

Step 1. Ifthe line of charge is circular, let ds be the are
length of an element of the distribution. If the line is
straight, run an x axis along it and let dx be the length of
an element. Mark the element ona sketch.

Step 2. Relate the charge dq of the element to the length of
the element with either dq = A ds or dq = Adx. Consider
dq and A to be positive, even if the charge is actually nega-
tive. (The sign of the charge is used in the next step.)

Step3. Express the field dE produced at P by dq with
Eq. 22-3, replacing q in that equation with either A ds or
A dx. If the charge on the line is positive, then at P draw a
vector dE that points directly away from dq. If the charge
is negative, draw the vector pointing directly toward dq.

Step 4. Always look for any symmetry in the situation. If
P is onan axis of symmetry of the charge distribution,
resolve the field dE produced by dq into components
that are perpendicular and parallel to the axis of symme-
try. Then consider a second element dq’ that is located
symmetrically to dg about the line of symmetry. At P
draw the vector dE’ that this symmetrical element pro-

duces and resolve it into components. One of the com-
ponents produced by dq is a canceling component, it is
canceled by the corresponding component produced by
dq' and needs no further attention. The other compo-
nent produced by dq is an adding component; it adds to
the corresponding component produced by dq’. Add the
adding components of all the elements via integration.

Step 5. Here are four general types of uniform charge
distributions, with strategies for the integral of step 4.

Ring, with point P on (central) axis of symmetry, as
i Fig. 22-11. In the expression for dE, replace r? with
2 + R’,as in Eq, 22-12. Express the adding component
of dE in terms of 6. That introduces cos 0, but @is identi-
cal for all elements and thus is not a variable. Replace
cos @ as in Eq. 22-13. Integrate over s, around the cir-
cumference of the ring.

Circular arc, with point P at the center of curva-
ture, as in Fig. 22-13. Express the adding component of
dE in terms of @. That introduces either sin @ or cos 6.
Reduce the resulting two variables s and @ to one, 6, by
replacing ds with r dé. Integrate over @ from one end
of the arc to the other end.

Straight line, with point P on an extension of the
line, as in Fig. 22-14a. In the expression for dE, replace
r with x. Integrate over x, from end to end of the line of
charge.
