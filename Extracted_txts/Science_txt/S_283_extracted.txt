The Three-
Dimensional Structure

of DNA

As it became clear that DNA was the
molecule that stored the hereditary
information, investigators began to
puzzle over how such a seemingly
simple molecule could carry out such
a complex function.

Franklin: X-ray Diffraction
Patterns of DNA

The significance of the regularities
pointed out by Chargaff were not im-
mediately obvious, but they became
clear when a British chemist, Ros-
alind Franklin (figure 14.9a), carried
out an X-ray diffraction analysis of
DNA. In X-ray diffraction, a mole-
cule is bombarded with a beam of X
rays. When individual rays encounter
atoms, their path is bent or dif-
fracted, and the diffraction pattern is
recorded on photographic film. The
patterns resemble the ripples created
by tossing a rock into a smooth lake
(figure 14.95). When carefully ana-
lyzed, they yield information about
the three-dimensional structure of a
molecule.

X-ray diffraction works best on
substances that can be prepared as
perfectly regular crystalline arrays.
However, it was impossible to obtain
true crystals of natural DNA at the
time Franklin conducted her analysis,
so she had to use DNA in the form of
fibers. Franklin worked in the labora-
tory of British biochemist Maurice
Wilkins, who was able to prepare
more uniformly oriented DNA fibers
than anyone had previously. Using
these fibers, Franklin succeeded in
obtaining crude diffraction informa-
tion on natural DNA. The diffrac-
tion patterns she obtained suggested
that the DNA molecule had the
shape of a helix, or corkscrew, with a
diameter of about 2 nanometers and
a complete helical turn every 3.4
nanometers (figure 14.92).
