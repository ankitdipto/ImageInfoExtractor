*3 SSM The nucleus ofa plutonium-239 atom contains 94 protons.
Assume that the nucleus is a sphere with radius 6.64 fm and with
the charge of the protons uniformly spread through the sphere. At
the surface of the nucleus, what are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion (radially inward or outward) of the electric field produced by
the protons?

charge —2.00 X 10-7 C is at position x = 6.00 cm and particle 2 of
charge +2.00 X 10-7 Cis at position x = 21.0 cm. Midway between
the particles, what is their net electric field in unit-vector notation?

nitude of 2.0 N/C at a point that is 50 cm away from the particle.

of charge g = 2.1 X 10-* C is at position x = 20 cm and particle 2 of
charge q7 = —4.00q, is at position x = 70 cm. At what coordinate on
the axis (other than at infinity) is the net electric field produced by

°°13 @ Hgure 22-40 shows a proton
(p) on the central axis through a disk
with a uniform charge density due to
excess electrons. The disk is seen from
an edge-on view. Three of those elec-
trons are shown: electron e, at the
disk center and electrons e, at oppo-
site sides of the disk, at radius R from

the center. The proton is initially at
distance z = R = 2.00 cm from the disk. At that location, what are

the magnitudes of (a) the electric field E, due to electron e, and (b)
the net electric field E,,,., due to electrons e,? The proton is then
moved to z= R/10.0. What then are the magnitudes of
(c) E. and (d) E,yo: at the proton’s location? (e) From (a) and (c)
we see that as the proton gets nearer to the disk, the magnitude of
E, increases, as expected. Why does the
magnitude of E,,., from the two side
electrons decrease, as we see from

(b) and (d)?
