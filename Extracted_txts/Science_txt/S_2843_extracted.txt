654 CHAPTER 22 ELECTRIC FIELDS

*°15 In Fig. 22-42, the three particles are ?
fixed in place and have charges q; = q =
+e and q;= +2e. Distance a = 6.00 um.
What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of the net electric field at point P due to
the particles?

16 Figure 22-43 shows a plastic ring of
radius R = 50.0cm. Two small charged
beads are on the ring: Bead 1 of charge
+2.00 uC is fixed in place at the left side;
bead 2 of charge +6.00 uC can be

moved along the ring. The two

beads produce a net electric field of Ring
magnitude E at the center of the

ring. At what (a) positive and (b) WA
negative value of angle @ should ya
bead 2 be positioned such that E =

2.00 X 10° NIC?

SBATMETwo charged beads are on
the plastic ring in Fig. 22-44a. Bead

2, which is not shown, is fixed in
place on the ring, which has radius
R = 60.0 cm. Bead 1, which is not fixed in place, is initially on the x
axis at angle @ = 0°. It is then moved to the opposite side, at angle
@ = 180°, through the first and second quadrants of the xy
coordinate system. Figure 22-44b gives the x component of the net
electric field produced at the origin by the two beads as a function
of @,and Fig. 22-44c gives the y component of that net electric field.
The vertical axis scales are set by E,, = 5.0 X 10 N/C and E,, =
—9.0 X 104 N/C. (a) At what angle @ is bead 2 located? What are
the charges of (b) bead 1 and (c) bead 2?

Module 22-3 The Electric Field Due to a Dipole

®48/The electric field of an electric dipole along the dipole axis is
approximated by Eqs. 22-8 and 22-9. If a binomial expansion is
made of Eq. 22-7, what is the next term in the expression for the di-
pole’s electric field along the dipole axis? That is, what is Eye, in
the expression

 

19 Figure 22-45 shows an electric dipole. What are the (a) magni-
tude and (b) direction (relative to the positive direction of the x axis)
of the dipole’s electric field at point P, located at distance r > d?

S200 Equations 22-8 and 22-9 are approximations of the magnitude
of the electric field of an electric dipole, at points along the dipole
axis. Consider a point P on that axis at distance z = 5.00d from the di-
pole center (d is the separation distance between the particles of the
dipole). Let E,,,, be the magnitude of the field at point P as approxi-
mated by Eqs. 22-8 and 22-9. Let E,., be the actual magnitude. What is
the ratio Eypp:/E ac?

21 ssm Electric quadrupole. Fig- *
ure 22-46 shows a generic electric yy
quadrupole. It consists of two dipoles | I

with dipole moments that are equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction.

tributed along a circular are of radius 4.00 cm, which subtends an
angle of 40°. What is the linear charge density along the arc? (b) A
charge —300e is uniformly distributed over one face of a circular
disk of radius 2.00 cm. What is the surface charge density over that
face? (c) A charge —300e is uniformly distributed over the surface
of a sphere of radius 2.00 cm. What is the surface charge density
over that surface? (d) A charge —300e is uniformly spread through
the volume of a sphere of radius 2.00 cm. What is the volume
charge density in that sphere?

lel nonconducting rings with their
central axes along a common line.
Ring 1 has uniform charge gq; and ra-
dius R; ring 2 has uniform charge q3
and the same radius R.The rings are
separated by distance d = 3.00R. The
net electric field at point P on the
common line, at distance R from ring
1, is zero. What is the ratio q;/q2?
