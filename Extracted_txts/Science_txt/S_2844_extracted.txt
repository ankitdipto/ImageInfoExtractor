28 Charge is uniformly distributed around a ring of radius
R=240cm, and the resulting electric field magnitude E is
measured along the ring’s central axis (perpendicular to the
plane of the ring). At what distance from the ring’s center is
Emaximum?

Show that the electric field E, at point

P makes an angle of 45° with the rod

and that this result is independent of
the distance R. (Hint: Separately find
the component of E, parallel to the
