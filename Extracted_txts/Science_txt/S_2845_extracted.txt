656 CHAPTER 22 ELECTRIC FIELDS

**37 Suppose you design an appa- z z
ratus in which a uniformly charged P tp
disk of radius R is to produce an
electric field. The field magnitude is
most important along the central
perpendicular axis of the disk, at a
point P at distance 2.00R from the
disk (Fig, 22-57a). Cost analysis sug-
gests that you switch to a ring of the
same outer radius R but with inner
radius R/2.00 (Fig, 22-57b). Assume
that the ring will have the same sur-
face charge density as the original disk. If you switch to the ring, by
what percentage will you decrease the electric field magnitude at P?

S38)[Figure 22-58a shows a circular disk that is uniformly
charged. The central z axis is perpendicular to the disk face, with
the origin at the disk. Figure 22-58b gives the magnitude of the
electric field along that axis in terms of the maximum magnitude
E,, at the disk surface. The z axis scale is set by z, = 8.0 cm. What is
the radius of the disk?

+39 In Millikan’s experiment, an oil drop of radius 1.64 um and
density 0.851 g/cm’ is suspended in chamber C (Fig. 22-16) when a
downward electric field of 1.92 X 10° N/C is applied. Find the
charge on the drop, in terms of e.

°40 ® Anelectron with a speed of 5.00 10° cm/s enters an elec-
tric field of magnitude 1.00 X 10° NIC, traveling along a field line
in the direction that retards its motion. (a) How far will the elec-
tron travel in the field before stopping momentarily, and (b) how
much time will have elapsed? (c) If the region containing the elec-
tric field is 8.00 mm long (too short for the electron to stop within
it), what fraction of the electron’s initial kinetic energy will be lost
in that region?

°41 ssm A charged cloud system produces an electric field in the
air near Earth’s surface. A’ particle of charge —2.0 X 10°C is
acted on by a downward electrostatic force of 3.0 X 10-° N when
placed in this field. (a) What is the magnitude of the electric field?
What are the (b) magnitude and (c) direction of the electrostatic
force F, on the proton placed in this field? (d) What is the magni-
tude of the gravitational force F; on the proton? (e) What is the ra-
tio F.,/F, in this case?

°42 Humid air breaks down (its molecules become ionized) in an
electric field of 3.0 x 10° N/C. In that field, what is the magnitude
of the electrostatic force on (a) an electron and (b) an ion with a
single electron missing?

°43 SSM An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric
field of magnitude 2.00 x 10* N/C. Calculate the acceleration of
the electron. (Ignore gravitation.)

44 Analpha particle (the nucleus of a helium atom) has a mass
of 6.64 X 10-77 kg and a charge of +2e. What are the (a) magnitude
and (b) direction of the electric field that will balance the gravita-
tional force on the particle?

°45 iW An electron on the axis of an electric dipole is 25 nm from
the center of the dipole. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic
force on the electron if the dipole moment is 3.6 x 10-??C-m?
Assume that 25 nm is much larger than the separation of the charged
particles that form the dipole.

°46 An electron is accelerated eastward at 1.80 X 10’ m/s* by
an electric field. Determine the field (a) magnitude and (b) di-
rection.

°47 ssM Beams of high-speed protons can be produced in
“guns” using electric fields to accelerate the protons. (a) What
acceleration would a proton experience if the gun’s electric field
were 2.00 X 10‘ N/C? (b) What speed

would the proton attain if the field ac-

celerated the proton through a distance e

of 1.00 cm?

“48 In Fig, 22-59, an electron (e) is to
be released from rest on the central axis
of a uniformly charged disk of radius R.
The surface charge density on the disk is
+4.00 wC/m?. What is the magnitude of
the electron’s initial acceleration if it is
released at a distance (a) R, (b) R/100,
and (c) R/1000 from the center of the disk? (d) Why does the ac-
celeration magnitude increase only slightly as the release point is
moved closer to the disk?

“49 A 10.0g block with a charge of +8.00 X 10-5 C is placed in
an electric field E = (30001 — 600) N/C. What are the (a) magni-
tude and (b) direction (relative to the positive direction of the x
axis) of the electrostatic force on the block? If the block is released
from rest at the origin at time t = 0, what are its (c) x and (d) y co-
ordinates at f = 3.00 s?

50 At some instant the velocity components of an electron
moving between two charged parallel plates are v, = 1.5 X 10° m/s
and v, = 3.0 X 10° m/s. Suppose the electric field between the
plates is uniform and given by E = (120 N/C)j. In unit-vector nota-
tion, what are (a) the electron’s acceleration in that field and\(b) the
electron’s velocity when its x coordinate has changed by 2.0 cm?

$57 SSS Assume that a honeybee is a sphere of diameter 1.000
cm with a charge of +45.0 pC uniformly spread over its surface.
Assume also that a spherical pollen grain of diameter 40.0 ym is
electrically held on the surface of the bee because the bee’s charge
induces a charge of —1.00 pC on the near side of the grain and a
charge of +1.00 pC on the far side. (a) What is the magnitude of
the net electrostatic force on the grain due to the bee? Next, as-
sume that the bee brings the grain to a distance of 1.000 mm from
the tip of a flower’s stigma and that the tip is a particle of charge

on the grain due to the stigma? (c) Does the grain remain on the
bee or does it move to the stigma?

initial velocity of 40 km/s in the same direction as the electric field,

electron travel during the 1.5 ns interval?
