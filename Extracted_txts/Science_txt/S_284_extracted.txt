Watson and Crick: A Model of
the Double Helix

Learning informally of Franklin’s re-
sults before they were published in
1953, James Watson and Francis
Crick, two young investigators at
Cambridge University, quickly
worked out a likely structure for the
DNA molecule (figure 14.10), which
we now know was substantially cor-
rect. They analyzed the problem de-
ductively, first building models of
the nucleotides, and then trying to
assemble the nucleotides into a mol-
ecule that matched what was known
about the structure of DNA. They
tried various possibilities before they
finally hit on the idea that the mole-
cule might be a simple double helix,
with the bases of two strands pointed
inward toward each other, forming
base-pairs. In their model, base-
pairs always consist of purines, which
are large, pointing toward pyrim-
idines, which are small, keeping the
diameter of the molecule a constant
2 nanometers. Because hydrogen
bonds can form between the bases in
a base-pair, the double helix is stabi-
lized as a duplex DNA molecule
composed of two antiparallel
strands, one chain running 3’ to 5’
and the other 5’ to 3’. The base-pairs
are planar (flat) and stack 0.34 nm
apart as a result of hydrophobic in-
teractions, contributing to the over-
all stability of the molecule.

The Watson—Crick model ex-
plained why Chargaff had obtained
the results he had: in a double helix,
adenine forms two hydrogen bonds
with thymine, but it will not form hy-
drogen bonds properly with cytosine.
Similarly, guanine forms three hydro-
gen bonds with cytosine, but it will
not form hydrogen bonds properly
with thymine. Consequently, adenine
and thymine will always occur in the
same proportions in any DNA mole-
cule, as will guanine and cytosine, be-
cause of this base-pairing.

The DNA molecule is a double
helix, the strands held together by
base-pairing.

DNA is a double helix. (a) Ina DNA
duplex molecule, only two base-pairs are
possible: adenine (A) can pair with thymine
(1), and guanine (G) can pair with cytosine
(C). An A-T base-pair has two hydrogen
bonds, while a G-C base-pair has three.

Crick (eft) deduced the structure of DNA in
1953 from Chargaff’s rules and Franklin’s
diffraction studies.
