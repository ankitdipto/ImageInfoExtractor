23-1 ELECTRIC FLUX 663

Sample Problem 23.02 Flux through a closed cube, nonuniform field

A nonuniform electric field given by E = 3.0xi + 4.0)
pierces the Gaussian cube shown in Fig. 23-7a. (E is in
newtons per coulomb and x is in meters.) What is the
electric flux through the right face, the left face, and the top
face? (We consider the other faces in another sample
problem.)

KEY IDEA

 

We can find the flux ® through the surface by integrating
the scalar product E- dA over each face.

Right face: An area vector A is always perpendicular to its
surface and always points away from the interior of a
Gaussian surface. Thus, the vector dA for any patch element
(small section) on the right face of the cube must point in
the positive direction of the x axis. An example of such an
element is shown in Figs. 23-7b and c, but we would have an
identical vector for any other choice of a patch element
on that face. The most convenient way to express the vector
is in unit-vector notation,

dA = dAi.
From Eq. 23-4, the flux ®, through the right face is then

The y component
is a constant.

axis lies within a nonuniform electric field that de-
pends on the value of x. (b) Each patch element has an
outward vector that is perpendicular to the area. (c)
Right face: the x component of the field pierces the
area and produces positive (outward) flux.The y com-
ponent does not pierce the area and thus does not
produce any flux. (Figure continues on following page)

‘We are about to integrate over the right face, but we note
that x has the same value everywhere on that face —namely,
x = 3.0 m. This means we can substitute that constant value
for x. This can be a confusing argument. Although x is cer-
tainly a variable as we move left to right across the figure,
because the right face is perpendicular to the x axis, every
point on the face has the same x coordinate. (The y and z co-
ordinates do not matter in our integral.) Thus, we have

= 30 | G0) dA = 90 f aa.

The integral {dA merely gives us the area A = 4.0 m? of the
right face, so

®, = (9.0 N/C)(4.0 m2) = 36N-m’/C. (Answer)

Left face: We repeat this procedure for the left face. However,

The element area vector
(for a patch element) is
perpendicular to the surface
and outward.
