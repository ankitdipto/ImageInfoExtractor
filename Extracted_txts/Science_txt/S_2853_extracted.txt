CHAPTER 23 GAUSS’ LAW

The y component of the
field skims the surface
and gives no flux. The

 

dot product is just zero.

The y component of the
field pierces the surface
and gives outward flux.
The dot product is positive.

 

 

The x component of the
field skims the surface
and gives no flux. The
dot product is just zero.

two factors change. (1) The element area vector dA points in
the negative direction of the x axis, and thus dA = —dAi
(Fig. 23-7d). (2) On the left face, x = 1.0m. With these
changes, we find that the flux ®, through the left face is

®, = -12N-mi/C. (Answer)

Top face: Now dA points in the positive direction of the y
axis, and thus dA = dAj (Fig.23-7e). The flux ®, is

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

23.09 Apply Gauss' law to relate the net flux ® through a
closed surface to the net enclosed charge enc.

23.10 Identify how the algebraic sign of the net enclosed
charge corresponds to the direction (inward or outward)
of the net flux through a Gaussian surface.

23.11 Identify that charge outside a Gaussian surface makes

no contribution to the net flux through the closed surface.
23.12 Derive the expression for the magnitude of the electric
field of a charged particle by using Gauss’ law.
23.13 Identify that for a charged particle or uniformly charged
sphere, Gauss’ law is applied with a Gaussian surface that
is a concentric sphere.

 

@ Gauss’ law relates the net flux ® penetrating a closed sur-
face to the net charge q.,, enclosed by the surface:

e9P = Gene (Gauss’ law).

Gauss’ Law

@ Gauss’ law can also be written in terms of the electric field
piercing the enclosing Gaussian surface:

aft: dA = dene (Gauss’ law).

Gauss’ law relates the net flux ® of an electric field through a closed surface
(a Gaussian surface) to the net charge der. that is enclosed by that surface. It tells us that

(Gauss’ law).
