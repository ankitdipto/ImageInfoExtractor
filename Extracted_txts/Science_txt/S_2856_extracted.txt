where in the last step we pull the field magnitude E out of
the integral because it is the same at all points on the
Gaussian sphere and thus is a constant. The remaining inte-
gral is simply an instruction for us to sum the areas of all the
patch elements on the sphere, but we already know that the
surface area of a sphere is 477. Substituting these results,
Eq. 23-7 for Gauss’ law gives us

The only charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface through P;
is that of the particle. Solving for E and substituting gen, = Se
and r = r; = 6.00 X 10°? m, we find that the magnitude of the

To find the electric field at P>, we follow the same pro-
cedure by constructing a Gaussian sphere with P, on its sur-
face. This time, however, the net charge enclosed by the sphere
iS dene = 4 + Q = Se + (—16e) = —11e. Because the net
charge is negative, the electric field vectors on the sphere’s
surface pierce inward (Fig. 23-10c), the angle @ between E.
and dA is 180°, and the dot product is E (cos 180°) dA =
—E dA. Now solving Gauss’ law for E and substituting r =

Note how different the calculations would have been if
we had put P; or P, on the surface of a Gaussian cube in-
stead of mimicking the spherical symmetry with a Gaussian
sphere. Then angle @ and magnitude E would have varied
considerably over the surface of the cube and evaluation of
the integral in Gauss’ law would have been difficult.

Sample Problem 23.04 Using Gauss’ law to find the enclosed charge

What is the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian cube of
Sample Problem 23.02?

KEY IDEA

The net charge enclosed by a (real or mathematical) closed
surface is related to the total electric flux through the
surface by Gauss’ law as given by Eq. 23-6 (egP = denc)-

Flux: To use Eq. 23-6, we need to know the flux through all
six faces of the cube. We already know the flux through the
right face (©,=36 N-m7/C), the left face (&,=—12
N-m/7/C), and the top face (®, = 16 N-m?/C).

For the bottom face, our calculation is just like that for
the top face except that the element area vector dA is
now directed downward along the y axis (recall, it must be
outward from the Gaussian enclosure). Thus, we have

a

dA = —dAj, and we find
®,=—-16N-m/C.
For the front face we have dA = dAk, and for the back face,
dA = —dAk. When we take the dot product of the given elec-
tric field E = 3.0x1 + 4.0} with either of these expressions for
dA, we get 0 and thus there is no flux through those faces. We
can now find the total flux through the six sides of the cube:
® = (36 — 12 + 16-16 + 0 + 0)N-m/C

= 24N-m/C.
Enclosed charge: Next, we use Gauss’ law to find the
charge den: enclosed by the cube:

ene = &9P = (8.85 X 107? C?7/N- m?)(24 N-m7/C)

Thus, the cube encloses a net positive charge.
