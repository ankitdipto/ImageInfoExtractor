Figure 23-19b shows the fields set up by the sheets to the left of
the sheets (L), between them (B), and to their right (R).
The resultant fields in these three regions follow from the
superposition principle. To the left, the field magnitude is
Ey = Es) — Ec)
= 3.84 x 105 N/C — 2.43 x 105 N/C
=14x 10°NIC. (Answer)
Because F,,) is larger than E,_), the net electric field E, in this
region is directed to the left, as Fig. 23-19c shows. To the right of
the sheets, the net electric field has the same magnitude but is
directed to the right, as Fig. 23-19c shows.
Between the sheets, the two fields add and we have
Ex = Ei.) + E>
= 3.84 x 105 N/C + 2.43 x 105 N/C
= 63 x 10° NIC.
The electric field E's is directed to the right.

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

23.26 Identify that a shell of uniform charge attracts or re-
pels a charged particle that is outside the shell as if all the
shell's charge is concentrated at the center of the shell.

23.27 Identify that if a charged particle is enclosed by a shell
of uniform charge, there is no electrostatic force on the
particle from the shell.

23.28 For a point outside a spherical shell with uniform

charge, apply the relationship between the electric field
magnitude E, the charge q on the shell, and the distance r
from the shell’s center.

23.29 Identify the magnitude of the electric field for points en-
closed by a spherical shell with uniform charge.

23.30 For a uniform spherical charge distribution (a uniform
ball of charge), determine the magnitude and direction of
the electric field at interior and exterior points.

 

@ Outside a spherical shell of uniform charge q, the electric
field due to the shell is radial (inward or outward, depending
on the sign of the charge) and has the magnitude

TE)

where r is the distance to the point of measurement from the
center of the shell. The field is the same as though all of the
charge is concentrated as a particle at the center of the shell.

Applying Gauss’ Law: Spherical Symmetry

@ Inside the shell, the field due to the shell is zero.

@ Inside a sphere with a uniform volume charge density, the
field is radial and has the magnitude

E= Tm t r (inside sphere of charge),
where q is the total charge, R is the sphere's radius, and r is
the radial distance from the center of the sphere to the point
of measurement.

Here we use Gauss’ law to prove the two shell theorems presented without proof

in Module 21-1:

Oo A shell of uniform charge attracts or repels a charged particle that is outside the
shell as if all the shell’s charge were concentrated at the center of the shell.
