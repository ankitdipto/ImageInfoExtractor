Module 23-1 Electric Flux

*1 SSM The square surface shown
in Fig. 23-30 measures 3.2 mm on
each side. It is immersed in a uni-
form electric field with magnitude
E = 1800 N/C and with field lines at
an angle of @ = 35° with a normal to
the surface, as shown. Take that
normal to be directed “outward,” as
though the surface were one face of

a box. Calculate the electric flux
through the surface.

*2 An electric field given by
E = 4.01 — 3.0(° + 2.0) pierces a
Gaussian cube of edge length 2.0 m
and positioned as shown in Fig. 23-7.
(The magnitude E is in newtons per
coulomb and the position x is in me-
ters.) What is the electric flux through
the (a) top face, (b) bottom face, (c) left
face, and (d) back face? (e) What is the
net electric flux through the cube?

3 The cube in Fig. 23-31 has edge
length 1.40 m and is oriented as shown
in a region of uniform electric field. Find
the electric flux through the right face if
the electric field, in newtons per coulomb, is given by (a) 6.001, (b)
— 2.00}, and (c) — 3.001 + 4.00k. (d) What is the total flux through the
cube for each field?

Module 23-2 Gauss’ Law

*4 In Fig, 23-32, a butterfly net is
ina uniform electric field of magni-
tude E = 3.0 mN/C. The rim, a cir-
cle of radius a = 11 cm, is aligned
perpendicular to the field. The net
contains no net charge. Find the
electric flux through the netting.

*5. In Fig. 23-33, a proton is a dis-

tance d/2 directly above the center of a square of side d. What is the
magnitude of the electric flux through the square? (Hint: Think of the
square as one face of a cube with edge d.)

*6 Ateach point on the surface of the cube shown in Fig. 23-31,
the electric field is parallel to the z axis. The length of each edge
of the cube is 3.0m. On the top face of the cube the field is

E = —34k NIC, and on the bottom face it is E= + 20k NIC.
Determine the net charge contained within the cube.

°7 A particle of charge 1.8 wC is at the center of a Gaussian cube
55 cm on edge. What is the net electric flux through the surface?

8 <= When a shower is turned on in a closed bathroom, the
splashing of the water on the bare tub can fill the room’s air with
negatively charged ions and produce an electric field in the air as
great as 1000 N/C. Consider a bathroom with dimensions 2.5 m x
3.0 m X 2.0m. Along the ceiling, floor, and four walls, approximate
the electric field in the air as being directed perpendicular to the sur-
face and as having a uniform magnitude of 600 N/C. Also, treat those
surfaces as forming a closed Gaussian surface around the room’s air.
What are (a) the volume charge density p and (b) the number of
excess elementary charges e per cubic meter in the room’s air?

with edge length 1.40 m. What are (a) the net flux ® through the
surface and (b) the net charge qeqe enclosed by the surface if
E = (3.00yj) NC, with y in meters? What

are (c) Band (d) dene if E = [-4.00i + ;

(6.00 + 3.00y)j] N/C?

surface in the shape of a cube of edge length y
2.00m. It lies in a region where the nonuni-
form electric field is given by E = (3.00r + *
4.00)i + 6.00} + 7.00k N/C, with x in meters
What is the net charge contained by the cube?

a cube of edge length 2.00 m, with one corner atx; = 5.00m,y; = 4.00
m. The cube lies in a region where the electric field vector is given by

charge contained by the cube?

conducting spherical shells fixed in
place. Shell 1 has uniform surface
charge density +6.0 4C/m? on its
outer surface and radius 3.0 cm;
shell 2 has uniform surface charge
density +4.0 uC/m? on its outer
surface and radius 2.0 cm; the shell
centers are separated by L = 10 cm.
In unit-vector notation, what is the
net electric field at x = 2.0 cm?
