+38 © In Fig. 23-48a, an electron is shot directly away from a uni-
formly charged plastic sheet, at speed v, = 2.0 X 105 m/s. The sheet is
nonconducting, flat, and very large. Figure 23-48b gives the electron’s
vertical velocity component v versus time ¢ until the return to the
launch point. What is the sheet’s surface charge density?

39 SSM In Fig. 23-49,a small, nonconducting +

ball of mass m = 1.0mg and charge q=2.0x | 4
10°C (distributed uniformly through its vol-
ume) hangs from an insulating thread that makes
an angle @=30° with a vertical, uniformly
charged nonconducting sheet (shown in cross sec-
tion). Considering the gravitational force on the
ball and assuming the sheet extends far vertically
and into and out of the page, calculate the surface

charge density cof the sheet.
+40 Figure 23-50 shows a very large nonconduct-* mq

ing sheet that has a uniform surface charge density
of «= ~—2.00 uCim’; it also shows a particle of
charge Q = 6.00 uC, at distance d from the sheet.
Both are fixed in place. If d = 0.200 m,
at what (a) positive and (b) negative
coordinate on the x axis (other than in-
finity) is the net electric field E,,., of
the sheet and particle zero? (c) If d =
0.800 m, at what coordinate on the x

axis is Ey, = 0?

41 @ An electron is shot directly
toward the center of a large metal
plate that has surface charge density —2.0 x 10~° C/m”. If the initial
kinetic energy of the electron is 1.60 X 10~'7 J and if the electron is to
stop (due to electrostatic repulsion from the plate) just as it reaches
the plate, how far from the plate must the launch point be?

tion through a very large nonconducting 2

45 Twocharged concentric spher-

ical shells have radii 10.0 cm and 15.0 cm. The charge on the inner
shell is 4.00 X 10-* C, and that on the outer shell is 2.00 x 10-* C.
Find the electric field (a) at r = 12.0 cmand (b) at r = 20.0 cm.

46 Assume that a ball of charged particles has a uniformly
distributed negative charge density except for a narrow radial
tunnel through its center, from the surface on one side to the
surface on the opposite side. Also assume that we can position a
proton anywhere along the tunnel or outside the ball. Let Fr be
the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the proton when it is
located at the ball’s surface, at radius R. As a multiple of R, how
far from the surface is there a point where the force magnitude is
0.50Fe if we move the proton (a) away from the ball and (b) into
the tunnel?

radius 10 cm. If the electric field 15cm from the center of the
sphere has the magnitude 3.0 x 103 N/C and is directed radially in-
ward, what is the net charge on the sphere?
