nonconducting spherical shell of in-
ner radius a = 2.00 cm and outer
dius b = 2.40 cm has (within its thick-
ness) a positive volume charge

out their volumes. Each has radius

60 <%= The chocolate crumb mystery. Explosions ignited by
electrostatic discharges (sparks) constitute a serious danger in fa-
cilities handling grain or powder. Such an explosion occurred in
chocolate crumb powder at a biscuit factory in the 1970s. Workers
usually emptied newly delivered sacks of the powder into a loading
bin, from which it was blown through electrically grounded plastic
pipes to a silo for storage. Somewhere along this route, two condi-
tions for an explosion were met: (1) The magnitude of an electric
field became 3.0 X 10° N/C or greater, so that electrical break-
down and thus sparking could occur. (2) The energy of a spark was
150 mJ or greater so that it could ignite the powder explosively. Let
us check for the first condition in the powder flow through the
plastic pipes.

Suppose a stream of negatively charged powder was blown
through a cylindrical pipe of radius R = 5.0 cm. Assume that the
powder and its charge were spread uniformly through the pipe
with a volume charge density p. (a) Using Gauss’ law, find an ex-
pression for the magnitude of the electric field E in the pipe as a
function of radial distance r from the pipe center. (b) Does E in-
crease or decrease with increasing r? (c) Is E directed radially in-
ward or outward? (d) For p = 1.1 X 10-3 C/m} (a typical value at
the factory), find the maximum E and determine where that maxi-
mum field occurs. (e) Could sparking occur, and if so, where? (The
story continues with Problem 70 in Chapter 24.)
