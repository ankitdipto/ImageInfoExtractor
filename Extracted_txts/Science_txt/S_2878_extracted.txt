24-1 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 689

By comparing Egs. 24-6 and 24-12, we see that in this special case, the work by the

applied force is the negative of the work by the field:

Wapp = —W (for K, = Ki).

Electron-volts. In atomic and subatomic physics, energy measures in the SI
unit of joules often require awkward powers of ten. A more convenient (but non-
SL unit) is the electron-volt (eV), which is defined to be equal to the work required
to move a single elementary charge e (such as that of an electron or proton)
through a potential difference AV of exactly one volt. From Eq. 24-6, we see that

the magnitude of this work is g AV. Thus,
leV=e(1V)

Sample Problem 24.01 Work and potential energy in an electric field
Electrons are continually being knocked out of air mole-
cules in the atmosphere by cosmic-ray particles coming in
from space. Once released, each electron experiences an E FE d

electric force F due to the electric field E that is produced
in the atmosphere by charged particles already on Earth.
Near Earth’s surface the electric field has the magnitude
E = 150 N/C and is directed downward. What is the change
AU in the electric potential energy of a released electron
when the electric force causes it to move vertically upward
through a distance d = 520m (Fig. 24-3)? Through what
potential change does the electron move?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The change AU in the electric potential energy of the
electron is related to the work W done on the electron by the
electric field. Equation 24-5 (W = —AU) gives the relation.
(2) The work done by a constant force Fona particle under-
going a displacement dis

W=F-d.
(3) The electric force and the electric field are related by the

force equation r= gE, where here q is the charge of an
electron (= —1.6 x 107" C).

Calculations: Substituting the force equation into the work
equation and taking the dot product yield

= qE-d= qEd cos 0,

where @ is the angle between the directions of E and d.
The field E is directed downward and the displacement d
is directed upward; so @ = 180°. We can now evaluate the
work as

W = (-1.6 x 10° C)(150 N/C)(520 m) cos 180°
=12x10¥J.
Equation 24-5 then yields
AU = —W=-12 x 10-"J. (Answer)

This result tells us that during the 520 m ascent, the electric

potential energy of the electron decreases by 1.2 x 107 J.

To find the change in electric potential, we apply Eq. 24-4:
AU ~12x10-¥J

— ——
—q  16x10-"C
= 45 x 10*V = 45 kV. (Answer)

This tells us that the electric force does work to move the
electron to a higher potential.
