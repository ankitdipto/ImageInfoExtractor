The Replication Process

To be effective, DNA replication must be fast and accurate.
The machinery responsible has been the subject of inten-
sive study for 40 years, and we now know a great deal about
it. The replication of DNA begins at one or more sites on
the DNA molecule where there is a specific sequence of
nucleotides called a replication origin (figure 14.13).
There the DNA replicating enzyme DNA polymerase III
and other enzymes begin a complex process that catalyzes
the addition of nucleotides to the growing complementary
strands of DNA (figure 14.14). Table 14.2 lists the proteins
involved in DNA replication in bacteria. Before consider-
ing the replication process in detail, let’s take a closer look
at DNA polymerase IIT.

DNA Polymerase TIT

The first DNA polymerase enzyme to be characterized,
DNA polymerase I of the bacterium Escherichia coli, is a rel-
atively small enzyme that plays a key supporting role in

Origins of replication. Ata site called the replication origin, the
DNA duplex opens to create two separate strands, each of which
can be used as a template for a new strand. Eukaryotic DNA has

multiple origins of replication.

How nucleotides are added in DNA replication. DNA polymerase III, along with other enzymes, catalyzes the addition of nucleotides
to the growing complementary strand of DNA. When a nucleotide is added, two of its phosphates are lost as pyrophosphate.
