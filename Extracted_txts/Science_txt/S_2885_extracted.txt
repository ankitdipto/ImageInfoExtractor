Sample Problem 24.03 Net potential of several charged particles

What is the electric potential at point P, located at the cen-
ter of the square of charged particles shown in Fig. 24-11a?
The distance d is 1.3 m, and the charges are

q = +12 nC, q3 = +31 nC,
—24 nC, qs = +17nC.

KEY IDEA

 

The electric potential V at point P is the algebraic sum of
the electric potentials contributed by the four particles.

The distance r is d/\/2, which is 0.919 m, and the sum of the
charges is

Close to any of the three positively charged particles in
Fig. 24-lla, the potential has very large positive values.
Close to the single negative charge, the potential has very
large negative values. Therefore, there must be points within
the square that have the same intermediate potential as that
at point P. The curve in Fig. 24-11 shows the intersection of
the plane of the figure with the equipotential surface that
contains point P.

Sample Problem 24.04 Potential is not a vector, orientation is irrelevant

(a) In Fig. 24-12a, 12 electrons (of charge —e) are equally
spaced and fixed around a circle of radius R. Relative to
V =0 at infinity, what are the electric potential and electric
field at the center C of the circle due to these electrons?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The electric potential V at C is the algebraic sum of the
electric potentials contributed by all the electrons. Because

Potential is a scalar and
orientation is irrelevant.

(b) The electrons nonuniformly spaced along an arc of the original circle.

Rie

electric potential is a scalar, the orientations of the electrons
do not matter. (2) The electric field at C is a vector quantity
and thus the orientation of the electrons is important.

Calculations: Because the electrons all have the same nega-
tive charge —e and are all the same distance R from C, Eq.
24-27 gives us 1

V=-12 =

are (Answer) (24-28)
Because of the symmetry of the arrangement in Fig. 24-12a,
the electric field vector at C due to any given electron is
canceled by the field vector due to the electron that is dia-
metrically opposite it. Thus, at C,

E=0.
(b) The electrons are moved along the circle until they are

nonuniformly spaced over a 120° arc (Fig. 24-12b). At C, find
the electric potential and describe the electric field.

 

(Answer)

Reasoning: The potential is still given by Eq. 24-28, because
the distance between C and each electron is unchanged and
orientation is irrelevant. The electric field is no longer zero,
however, because the arrangement is no longer symmetric.
A net field is now directed toward the charge distribution.
