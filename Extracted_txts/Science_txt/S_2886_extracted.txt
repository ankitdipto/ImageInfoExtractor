Key Idea
@ At a distance r from an electric dipole with dipole moment magnitude p = qd, the electric potential of the dipole is

Potential Due to an Electric Dipole

Now let us apply Eq. 24-27 to an electric dipole to find the potential at an
arbitrary point P in Fig. 24-13a. At P, the positively charged particle (at distance
74) sets up potential V;,) and the negatively charged particle (at distance r(_))
sets up potential V;_). Then the net potential at P is given by Eq. 24-27 as

Naturally occurring dipoles—such as those possessed by many mole-
cules—are quite small; so we are usually interested only in points that are rel-
atively far from the dipole, such that r > d, where d is the distance between
the charges and r is the distance from the dipole’s midpoint to P. In that case, 2
we can approximate the two lines to P as being parallel and their length dif- ,
ference as being the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse d (Fig. 24-13b). /
