24-5 POTENTIAL DUE TO A CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION 699

integrate to sum the potentials due to all the charge elements:

V= | av=—t | ce (24-32)

Ameo r

 

The integral must be taken over the entire charge distribution. Note that because
the electric potential is a scalar, there are no vector components to consider in
Eq. 24-32.

‘We now examine two continuous charge distributions, a line and a disk.

Line of Charge
In Fig. 24-15a, a thin nonconducting rod of length L has a positive charge of
uniform linear density A. Let us determine the electric potential V due to the rod
at point P,a perpendicular distance d from the left end of the rod.

‘We consider a differential element dx of the rod as shown in Fig. 24-155. This
(or any other) element of the rod has a differential charge of

dq = Adx. (24-33)

This element produces an electric potential dV at point P, which is a distance
r = (x? + d?)!” from the element (Fig. 24-15c). Treating the element as a point
charge, we can use Eq. 24-31 to write the potential dV as
