700 CHAPTER 24 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

r 2 Every charge element
in the ring contributes
to the potential at P.

   

Figure 24-16 A plastic disk of radius R,
charged on its top surface to a uniform
surface charge density a. We wish to
find the potential V at point P on the
central axis of the disk.

Since the charge on the rod is positive and we have taken V = 0 at infinity, we
know from Module 24-3 that dV in Eq. 24-34 must be positive.

We now find the total potential V produced by the rod at point P by integrat-
ing Eq. 24-34 along the length of the rod, from x = 0 tox = L (Figs.24-15d and e),
using integral 17 in Appendix E. We find

We can simplify this result by using the general relation In A — In B = In(A/B).
We then find

Because V is the sum of positive values of dV, it too is positive, consistent with
the logarithm being positive for an argument greater than 1.

Charged Disk

In Module 22-5, we calculated the magnitude of the electric field at points on the
central axis of a plastic disk of radius R that has a uniform charge density 7 on
one surface. Here we derive an expression for V(z), the electric potential at any
point on the central axis. Because we have a circular distribution of charge on the
disk, we could start with a differential element that occupies angle d@ and radial
distance dr. We would then need to set up a two-dimensional integration.
However, let’s do something easier.

In Fig. 24-16, consider a differential element consisting of a flat ring of radius
R’ and radial width dR’. Its charge has magnitude

dq = o(27R')(dR’),

in which (27R’)(dR’) is the upper surface area of the ring. All parts of this
charged element are the same distance r from point P on the disk’s axis. With the
aid of Fig. 24-16, we can use Eq. 24-31 to write the contribution of this ring to
the electric potential at Pas

We find the net potential at P by adding (via integration) the contributions of all
the rings from R' = 0 to R’ = R:

Note that the variable in the second integral of Eq. 24-37 is R’ and not z, which
remains constant while the integration over the surface of the disk is carried out.
(Note also that, in evaluating the integral, we have assumed that z = 0.)
