The DNA polymerase III complex. (a) The complex contains
10 kinds of protein chains. The protein is a dimer because both
strands of the DNA duplex must be replicated simultaneously.
The catalytic ()) subunits, the proofreading (e) subunits, and the

“sliding clamp” units encircle the DNA template and (c) move it
through the catalytic subunit like a rope drawn through a ring.
