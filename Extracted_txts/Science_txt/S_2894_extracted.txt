The negative potential energy means that negative
work would have to be done to assemble this structure,
starting with the three charges infinitely separated and at
rest. Put another way, an external agent would have to do 17
mJ of positive work to disassemble the structure completely,
ending with the three charges infinitely far apart.

The lesson here is this: If you are given an assembly of
charged particles, you can find the potential energy of the as-
sembly by finding the potential of every possible pair of the
particles and then summing the results.

Sample Problem 24.07 Conservation of mechanical energy with electric potential energy

An alpha particle (two protons, two neutrons) moves into a
stationary gold atom (79 protons, 118 neutrons), passing
through the electron region that surrounds the gold nucleus
like a shell and headed directly toward the nucleus
(Fig. 24-20). The alpha particle slows until it momentarily
stops when its center is at radial distance r = 9.23 fm from
the nuclear center. Then it moves back along its incoming
path. (Because the gold nucleus is much more massive
than the alpha particle, we can assume the gold nucleus
does not move.) What was the kinetic energy K; of the al-
pha particle when it was initially far away (hence external
to the gold atom)? Assume that the only force acting be-
tween the alpha particle and the gold nucleus is the (elec-
trostatic) Coulomb force and treat each as a single charged
particle.

KEY IDEA

 

During the entire process, the mechanical energy of the
alpha particle + gold atom system is conserved.

Reasoning: When the alpha particle is outside the atom,
the system’s initial electric potential energy U; is zero be-
cause the atom has an equal number of electrons and pro-
tons, which produce a net electric field of zero. However,
once the alpha particle passes through the electron region
surrounding the nucleus on its way to the nucleus, the elec-
tric field due to the electrons goes to zero. The reason is that
the electrons act like a closed spherical shell of uniform neg-
ative charge and, as discussed in Module 23-6, such a shell
produces zero electric field in the space it encloses. The
alpha particle still experiences the electric field of the
protons in the nucleus, which produces a repulsive force on
the protons within the alpha particle.

Figure 24-20 An alpha particle, traveling head-on toward the center of
a gold nucleus, comes to amomentary stop (at which time all its ki-
netic energy has been transferred to electric potential energy) and
then reverses its path.

As the incoming alpha particle is slowed by this repul-
sive force, its kinetic energy is transferred to electric poten-
tial energy of the system. The transfer is complete when the
alpha particle momentarily stops and the kinetic energy is
K;=0.

Calculations: The principle of conservation of mechanical
energy tells us that

Kj + U= Ky + Uy. (24-47)

‘We know two values: U; = 0 and K;= 0. We also know that
the potential energy U; at the stopping point is given by the
right side of Eq. 24-46, with q, = 2e, q = 79e (in which e is
the elementary charge, 1.60 x 10°C), and r= 9.23 fm.
Thus, we can rewrite Eq. 24-47 as
