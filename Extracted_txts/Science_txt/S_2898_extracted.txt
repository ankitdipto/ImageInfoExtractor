V = 0 at infinity and consider V,,,, at points on the x axis. For which
pairs is there a point at which V,,, = 0 (a) between the particles and
(b) to the right of the particles? (c) At such a pointis Eu, due to the par-
ticles equal to zero? (d) For each pair, are there off-axis points (other
than at infinity) where V,,., = 0?

positively charged sphere B, which

7 Figure 24-30 shows a system of three charged particles. If you
move the particle of charge +q from point A to point D, are the
following quantities positive, negative, or zero: (a) the change in
the electric potential energy of the three-particle system, (b) the
work done by the net electric force on the particle you moved (that
is, the net force due to the other two particles), and (c) the work
done by your force? (d) What are the answers to (a) through (c) if,
instead, the particle is moved from B to C?

and then is to be accelerated directly through point B by an elec-
tric field. The potential difference between points A and B is 100
