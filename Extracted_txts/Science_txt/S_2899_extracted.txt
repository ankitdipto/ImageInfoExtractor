Module 24-1 Electric Potential

*1 ssm A particular 12 V car battery can send a total charge of
84.A -h (ampere-hours) through a circuit, from one terminal to the
other. (a) How many coulombs of charge does this represent?
(Hint: See Eq. 21-3.) (b) If this entire charge undergoes a change in
electric potential of 12 V,how much energy is involved?

°2 The electric potential difference between the ground and a
cloud in a particular thunderstorm is 1.2 x 10° V. In the unit
electron-volts, what is the magnitude of the change in the electric
potential energy of an electron that moves between the ground
and the cloud?

°3 Suppose that in a lightning flash the potential difference be-
tween a cloud and the ground is 1.0 x 10° V and the quantity of
charge transferred is 30 C. (a) What is the change in energy of that
transferred charge? (b) If all the energy released could be used to
accelerate a 1000 kg car from rest, what would be its final speed?

electric field at the position of the electron. (b) What is the poten-
tial difference between the plates?
