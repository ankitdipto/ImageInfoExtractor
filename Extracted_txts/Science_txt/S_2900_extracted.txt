potential V at the origin due to the two particles as a function of
the x coordinate of particle 2. The scale of the x axis is set by x, =

d in Fig. 24-40. The net electric field due to the particles is zero at

the x axis (other than at infinity) at which the electric potential due

is at the center of the dipole.) The particle is then moved along a
circular path around the dipole center until it is at coordinate z =
—20 nm, on the negative side of the dipole axis. Figure 24-41 gives
the work W, done by the force moving the particle versus the angle 0
that locates the particle relative to the positive direction of the z
axis. The scale of the vertical axis is set by W,,, = 4.0 x 10-*° J. What
