712 CHAPTER 24 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

“27 _ In Fig. 24-46, three thin plas-
tic rods form quarter-circles with a
common center of curvature at the
origin. The uniform charges on the
three rods are Q, = +30nC, Q, =
+3.0Q;, and Q; = —8.0Q;. What is
the net electric potential at the ori-
gin due to the rods?

plastic rod of length L = 12.0cm
and uniform positive charge Q =
56.1 fC lying on an x axis. With V = 0
at infinity, find the electric potential
at point P; on the axis, at distance
d = 2.50 cm from the rod.

ture is at the origin and its radius is R = 2.00 m; the angle indicated
is 9 = 20.0°.

°°31 ssM www A plastic disk of
radius R = 64.0 cm is charged on
one side with a uniform surface
charge density o = 7.73 fC/m’,
and then three quadrants of the disk
are removed. The remaining quadrant is shown in Fig, 24-50. With
V = Oat infinity, what is the potential due to the remaining quad-
rant at point P, which is on the central axis of the original disk at
distance D = 25.9 cm from the original center?

32 © A nonuniform linear charge distribution given by A =
bx, where b is a constant, is located along an x axis from x = 0 to
20m. If b = 20nC/m? and V = 0 at infinity, what is the
electric potential at (a) the origin and (b) the point y = 0.15 m
on the y axis?

12.0cm and a nonuniform linear charge density A = cx, where
c = 28.9 pC/m”. With V = 0 at infinity, find the electric potential
at point P; on the axis, at distance d = 3.00 cm from one end.

Module 24-6 Calculating the Field from the Potential

34 Two large parallel metal plates are 1.5 cm apart and have
charges of equal magnitudes but opposite signs on their facing sur-
faces. Take the potential of the negative plate to be zero. If the
potential halfway between the plates is then +5.0 V, what is the
electric field in the region between the plates?

 

°35 The electric potential at points in an xy plane is given by
V = (2.0 Vim?)x? — (3.0 V/m’)y*. In unit-vector notation, what is
the electric field at the point (3.0 m, 2.0 m)?

*36 The electric potential Vin the space between two flat parallel
plates 1 and 2 is given (in volts) by V = 1500x2, where x (in meters)
is the perpendicular distance from plate 1. At x = 1.3 cm, (a) what
is the magnitude of the electric field and (b) is the field directed to-
ward or away from plate 1?

37 SsM What is the magnitude of the electric field at the point
(3.001 — 2.00} + 4.00k) m if the electric potential in the region is
given by V = 2.00xyz’, where V is in volts and coordinates x, y,
and z are in meters?

38 Figure 24-47 shows a thin plastic rod of length L = 13.5 cm
and uniform charge 43.6 fC. (a) In terms of distance d, find an ex-
pression for the electric potential at point P;. (b) Next, substitute
variable x for d and find an expression for the magnitude of the
component E, of the electric field at P;. (c) What is the direction of
E, relative to the positive direction of the x axis? (d) What is the
value of E, at P, for x = d = 6.20 cm? (e) From the symmetry in
Fig. 24-47, determine E, at P.

39 An electron is placed in an xy plane where the electric po-
tential depends on x and y as shown, for the coordinate axes, in
Fig. 24-51 (the potential does not depend on z). The scale of the
vertical axis is set by V, = 500 V. In unit-vector notation, what is
the electric force on the electron?
