Module 24-7 Electric Potential Energy of a System

of Charged Particles

°41 A particle of charge +7.5 uC is released from rest at the
point x = 60 cm on an x axis. The particle begins to move due to
the presence of a charge Q that remains fixed at the origin. What is
the kinetic energy of the particle at the instant it has moved 40 cm
if (a) Q = +20 wCand (b) Q = —20 uC?

°42 (a) What is the electric potential energy of two electrons
separated by 2.00 nm? (b) If the separation increases, does the po-
tential energy increase or decrease?

fixed in place to form a square with an edge e +4q

length of 4.0 cm. How much work must we do
to bring a particle of charge +6¢ initially at

*°45 \Lw A particle of charge q is fixed at point P, and a second
particle of mass m and the same charge q is initially held a distance
r, from P. The second particle is then released. Determine its speed
when it is a distance r) from P. Let q = 3.1 uC, m = 20 mg, rn) =
0.90 mm, and ry = 2.5 mm.

46 A charge of —9.0 nC is uniformly distributed around a thin
plastic ring lying in a yz plane with the ring center at the origin. A
—6.0 pC particle is located on the x axis at x = 3.0 m. For a ring ra-
dius of 1.5m, how much work must an external force do on the
particle to move it to the origin?

47 © Whatis the escape speed for an electron initially at rest on
the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1.0 cm and a uniformly dis-
tributed charge of 1.6 X 10-'5 C? That is, what initial speed must
the electron have in order to reach an infinite distance from the
sphere and have zero kinetic energy when it gets there?

+48 A thin, spherical, conducting shell of radius R is mounted
on an isolating support and charged to a potential of —125 V. An
electron is then fired directly toward the center of the shell, from
point P at distance r from the center of the shell (r > R). What ini-
tial speed vy is needed for the electron to just reach the shell before
reversing direction?

shot from infinity and stops midway between the two. What is its
initial speed?

electron moving along an electric
dipole axis toward the negative
side of the dipole. The dipole is
fixed in place. The electron was
initially very far from the dipole,
with kinetic energy 100 eV. Figure
24-56b gives the kinetic energy K
of the electron versus its distance
r from the dipole center. The v(m)

scale of the horizontal axis is set ®

“53  Twotiny metal spheres A and B, mass m4 = 5.00 gand my =

nected by a massless nonconducting string of length d = 1.00 m,
which is much greater than the radii of the spheres. (a) What is the
electric potential energy of the system? (b) Suppose you cut
the string. At that instant, what is the acceleration of each sphere? (c)
A long time after you cut the string, what is the speed of each sphere?

mass equal to the electron mass) is
moving at 1.0 X 10’ m/s in the posi- Vs

tive direction of an x axis when, at

x = 0, it encounters an electric field

directed along the x axis. The electric

55 An electron is projected with an initial speed of 3.2 x 105 m/s
directly toward a proton that is fixed in place. If the electron is ini-
tially a great distance from the proton, at what distance from the
proton is the speed of the electron instantaneously equal to twice
the initial value?

a charge of +3.0 uC) are fixed in place with separation d = 4.0 cm
