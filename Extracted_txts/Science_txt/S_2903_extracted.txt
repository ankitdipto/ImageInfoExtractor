the x axis to the right of particle 2. Figure 24-58b gives the electric
potential energy U of the three-particle system as a function of the
x coordinate of particle 3. The scale of the vertical axis is set by
U, = 5.0 J. What is the charge of particle 3?

x = +3.0m.A particle of charge g = —15 Cis then released from
rest at a point on the positive part of the y axis. Due to the symme-
try of the situation, the particle moves along the y axis and has ki-
netic energy 1.2 J as it passes through the point x = 0, y = 4.0m.
(a) What is the kinetic energy of the particle as it passes through
the origin? (b) At what negative value of y will the particle mo-
mentarily stop?

The scale of the ver-

V, = 10.0 V. A pro-
ton is to be released
at x=35cm with
initial kinetic energy 4.00 eV. (a) If it is initially moving in the neg-
ative direction of the axis, does it reach a turning point (if so, what
is the x coordinate of that point) or does it escape from the plotted
region (if so, what is its speed at x = 0)? (b) If it is initially moving
in the positive direction of the axis, does it reach a turning point (if
so, what is the x coordinate of that point) or does it escape from the
plotted region (if so, what is its speed at x = 6.0 cm)? What are the
(c) magnitude F and (d) direction (positive or negative direction of
the x axis) of the electric force on the proton if the proton moves
just to the left of x = 3.0 cm? What are (e) Fand (f) the direction if
the proton moves just to the right of x = 5.0 cm?

°°60 In Fig. 24-614, we move an electron from an infinite distance
to a point at distance R = 8.00 cm from a tiny charged ball. The
move requires work W = 2.16 X 10-'J by us. (a) What is the
charge Q on the ball? In Fig. 24-616, the ball has been sliced up and
the slices spread out so that an equal amount of charge is at the
hour positions on a circular clock face of radius R = 8.00 cm. Now
the electron is brought from an infinite distance to the center of

 

 

the circle. (b) With that addition of the electron to the system of 12
charged particles, what is the change in the electric potential en-
ergy of the system?

**°61 Suppose N electrons can be placed in either of two
configurations. In configuration 1, they are all placed on the cir-
cumference of a narrow ring of radius R and are uniformly distrib-
uted so that the distance between adjacent electrons is the same
everywhere. In configuration 2, N—1 electrons are uniformly
distributed on the ring and one electron is placed in the center of the
ring. (a) What is the smallest value of N for which the second config-
uration is less energetic than the first? (b) For that value of N, con-
sider any one circumference electron—call it e9. How many other
circumference electrons are closer to eg than the central electron is?

radius 2.00R; is far from sphere 1 and initially uncharged. After the
separated spheres are connected with a wire thin enough to retain
only negligible charge, (a) is potential V; of sphere 1 greater than,
less than, or equal to potential V2 of sphere 2? What fraction of q

center-to-center separation of 2.0 m. Sphere 1 has charge +1.0 X
10-* C; sphere 2 has charge —3.0 X 10-§ C. Assume that the sepa-
ration is large enough for us to say that the charge on each sphere
is uniformly distributed (the spheres do not affect each other).
With V = 0 at infinity, calculate (a) the potential at the point
halfway between the centers and the potential on the surface of
(b) sphere 1 and (c) sphere 2.
