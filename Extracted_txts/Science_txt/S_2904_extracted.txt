69 ssM A long, solid, conducting cylinder has a radius of 2.0 cm.
The electric field at the surface of the cylinder is 160 N/C, directed
radially outward. Let A, B, and C be points that are 1.0 cm, 2.0 cm,
and 5.0 cm, respectively, from the central axis of the cylinder. What

Problem 60 in Chapter 23. (a) From the answer to part (a) of that
problem, find an expression for the electric potential as a function
of the radial distance r from the center of the pipe. (The electric
potential is zero on the grounded pipe wall.) (b) For the typical
volume charge density p = —1.1 X 10-3 C/m}, what is the differ-
ence in the electric potential between the pipe’s center and its in-
side wall? (The story continues with Problem 60 in Chapter 25.)
