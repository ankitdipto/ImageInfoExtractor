716 CHAPTER 24 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

86 Figure 24-68 shows a hemi- 3
sphere with a charge of 4.00 uC dis- © Pp
tributed uniformly through its vol-
ume. The hemisphere lies on an xy ¥

plane the way half a grapefruit might .

lie face down on a kitchen table,  iawe2#-48 Problem 86.
Point P is located on the plane, along a radial line from the hemi-
sphere’s center of curvature, at radial distance 15 cm. What is the
electric potential at point P due to the hemisphere?

87 ssm Three +0.12 C charges form an equilateral triangle 1.7 m
ona side. Using energy supplied at the rate of 0.83 kW, how many
days would be required to move one of the charges to the midpoint
of the line joining the other two charges?

88 Two charges q=+2.0uC are c
fixed a distance d = 2.0 cm apart (Fig, I

24-69). (a) With V = Oat infinity, what is

the electric potential at point C? (b) °

You bring a third charge g = +2.0 uC

from infinity to C. How much work @-— /2—-*— 4/2—-@
must you do? (c) What is the potential
energy Uof the three-charge configura-
tion when the third charge is in place?

89 Initially two electrons are fixed in place with a separation of
2.00 um. How much work must we do to bring a third electron in
from infinity to complete an equilateral triangle?

90 A particle of positive charge Q is fixed at point P. A second
particle of mass m and negative charge —q moves at constant
speed ina circle of radius r;, centered at P. Derive an expression
for the work W that must be done by an external agent on
the second particle to increase the radius of the circle of
motion to r2.

91 Two charged, parallel, flat conducting surfaces are spaced d =
1.00 cm apart and produce a potential difference AV = 625 V be-
tween them. An electron is projected from one surface directly to-
ward the second. What is the initial speed of the electron if it stops
just at the second surface?

an xy plane and centered on the origin. The ring’s radius is 3.00 cm.
If point A is at the origin and point B is on the z axis at z = 4.00

94 Consider a particle with charge q = 1.50 X 10-8C, and take
V = 0 at infinity. (a) What are the shape and dimensions of an
equipotential surface having a potential of 30.0 V due to q alone?
(b) Are surfaces whose potentials differ by a constant amount
(1.0V, say) evenly spaced?

95 SSM A thick spherical shell of charge Q and uniform volume
charge density p is bounded by radii r; and 7 > r;. With V = 0 at
infinity, find the electric potential V as a function of distance r from
the center of the distribution, considering regions (a) r > ry,
(b) > r> rn, and (c) r < 7;. (d) Do these solutions agree with
each other at r = ry and r = r;? (Hint: See Module 23-6.)

96 A charge q is distributed uniformly throughout a spherical
volume of radius R. Let V = 0 at infinity. What are (a) V at radial
distance r < R and (b) the potential difference between points at
r = Rand the point atr = 0?

97 ssm A solid copper sphere whose radius is 1.0 cm has a very
thin surface coating of nickel. Some of the nickel atoms are
radioactive, each atom emitting an electron as it decays. Half
of these electrons enter the copper sphere, each depositing 100 keV
of energy there. The other half of the electrons escape, each carrying
away a charge —e.The nickel coating has an activity of 3.70 x 10° ra-
dioactive decays per second. The sphere is hung from a long, non-
conducting string and isolated from its surroundings. (a) How long
will it take for the potential of the sphere to increase by 1000 V? (b)
How long will it take for the temperature of the sphere to increase
by 5.0K due to the energy deposited by the electrons? The heat
capacity of the sphere is 14 J/K.

98 In Fig. 24-71, a metal sphere

with charge g = 5.00 uC and radius Q
r = 3.00 cm is concentric with a
larger metal sphere with charge Q =
15.0 wC and radius R = 6.00 cm. (a)
What is the potential difference be-
tween the spheres? If we connect the
spheres with a wire, what then is the
charge on (b) the smaller sphere and
(c) the larger sphere?

99 (a) Using Eq. 24-32, show that
the electric potential at a point on
the central axis of a thin ring (of
charge q and radius R) and at dis-
tance z from the ring is

nitude E at points on the ring’s axis; compare your result with the
calculation of E in Module 22-4.

100 An alpha particle (which has two protons) is sent directly to-
ward a target nucleus containing 92 protons. The alpha particle has
an initial kinetic energy of 0.48 pJ. What is the least center-to-center
distance the alpha particle will be from the target nucleus, assum-
ing the nucleus does not move?

101 In the quark model of fundamental particles, a proton is
composed of three quarks: two “up” quarks, each having charge
+2e/3, and one “down” quark, having charge —e/3. Suppose that
the three quarks are equidistant from one another. Take that sepa-
ration distance to be 1.32 X 10-m and calculate the electric
potential energy of the system of (a) only the two up quarks and
(b) all three quarks.

102 Accharge of 1.50 X 10-8 C lies on an isolated metal sphere of
radius 16.0 cm. With V = 0 at infinity, what is the electric potential
at points on the sphere’s surface?
