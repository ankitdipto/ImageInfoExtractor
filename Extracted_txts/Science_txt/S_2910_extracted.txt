25-2 CALCULATING THE CAPACITANCE 721

at the edges of the plates, taking E to be constant throughout the region between
the plates.

‘We draw a Gaussian surface that encloses just the charge q on the positive
plate, as in Fig. 25-5. From Eq. 25-4 we can then write

q = EEA, (25-7)
where A is the area of the plate.
Equation 25-6 yields

+ ‘d
v= ['ea-e| ds = Ed. (25-8)

In Eg. 25-8, E can be placed outside the integral because it is a constant; the sec-
ond integral then is simply the plate separation d.

If we now substitute q from Eq. 25-7 and V from Eq. 25-8 into the relation
q = CV (Eq.25-1), we find

(parallel-plate capacitor). (25-9)

Thus, the capacitance does indeed depend only on geometrical factors—namely,
the plate area A and the plate separation d. Note that C increases as we increase
area A or decrease separation d.

As an aside, we point out that Eq. 25-9 suggests one of our reasons for writing
the electrostatic constant in Coulomb’s law in the form 1/479. If we had not
done so, Eq. 25-9—which is used more often in engineering practice than
Coulomb’s law—would have been less simple in form. We note further that
Eg. 25-9 permits us to express the permittivity constant 9 in a unit more appro-
priate for use in problems involving capacitors; namely,

£9 = 8.85 X 10°? Fim = 8.85 pF/m. (25-10)
We have previously expressed this constant as

£9 = 8.85 X 10°? C7/N-m?. (25-11)

A Cylindrical Capacitor

Figure 25-6 shows, in cross section, a cylindrical capacitor of length L formed by
two coaxial cylinders of radii a and b. We assume that L > b so that we can
neglect the fringing of the electric field that occurs at the ends of the cylinders.
Each plate contains a charge of magnitude q.

As a Gaussian surface, we choose a cylinder of length L and radius r, closed
by end caps and placed as is shown in Fig. 25-6. It is coaxial with the cylinders
and encloses the central cylinder and thus also the charge q on that cylinder.
Equation 25-4 then relates that charge and the field magnitude E as

q = EEA = &E(2aL),

in which 27rL is the area of the curved part of the Gaussian surface. There is
no flux through the end caps. Solving for E yields
