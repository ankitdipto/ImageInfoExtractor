Using Eq. 25-20 you can show that the equivalent capacitance of a series of
capacitances is always /ess than the least capacitance in the series.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

A battery of potential V stores charge g on a combination of two identical capacitors.
What are the potential difference across and the charge on either capacitor if the ca-
pacitors are (a) in parallel and (b) in series?

Sample Problem 25.02 Capacitors in parallel and in series

(a) Find the equivalent capacitance for the combination of
capacitances shown in Fig. 25-10a, across which potential
difference V is applied. Assume

C,=120uF, G=5.30uR and C,= 4.50 uF

KEY IDEA

 

Any capacitors connected in series can be replaced with

parallel can be replaced with their equivalent capacitor.
Therefore, we should first check whether any of the capaci-
tors in Fig. 25-10a are in parallel or series.

Finding equivalent capacitance: Capacitors 1 and 3 are
connected one after the other, but are they in series? No.
The potential V that is applied to the capacitors produces
charge on the bottom plate of capacitor 3. That charge
causes charge to shift from the top plate of capacitor 3.

However, note that the shifting charge can move to the bot-
