25-3 CAPACITORS IN PARALLEL AND IN SERIES

tom plates of both capacitor 1 and capacitor 2. Because
there is more than one route for the shifting charge, capaci-
tor 3 is not in series with capacitor 1 (or capacitor 2). Any
time you think you might have two capacitors in series, ap-
ply this check about the shifting charge.

Are capacitor 1 and capacitor 2 in parallel? Yes. Their
top plates are directly wired together and their bottom
plates are directly wired together, and electric potential
is applied between the top-plate pair and the bottom-plate
pair. Thus, capacitor 1 and capacitor 2 are in parallel, and
Eq. 25-19 tells us that their equivalent capacitance Cis

Cy = C, + Cy = 12.0 uF + 5.30 uF = 17.3 uF.

In Fig. 25-10b, we have replaced capacitors 1 and 2 with
their equivalent capacitor, called capacitor 12 (say “one
two” and not “twelve”). (The connections at points A and B
are exactly the same in Figs. 25-10a and b.)

Is capacitor 12 in series with capacitor 3? Again apply-
ing the test for series capacitances, we see that the charge
that shifts from the top plate of capacitor 3 must entirely go
to the bottom plate of capacitor 12. Thus, capacitor 12 and
capacitor 3 are in series, and we can replace them with their
equivalent C,,; (“one two three”), as shown in Fig. 25-10c.
From Eq. 25-20, we have

KEY IDEAS

 

‘We now need to work backwards from the equivalent
capacitance to get the charge on a particular capacitor. We
have two techniques for such “backwards work”: (1) Seri-q:
Series capacitors have the same charge as their equivalent
capacitor. (2) Par-V: Parallel capacitors have the same
potential difference as their equivalent capacitor.

Working backwards: To get the charge q, on capacitor 1,
we work backwards to that capacitor, starting with the
equivalent capacitor 123. Because the given potential differ-
ence V (= 12.5 V) is applied across the actual combination
of three capacitors in Fig. 25-10a, it is also applied across
Cp; in Figs. 25-10d and e. Thus, Eq. 25-1 (q¢ = CV) gives us

dis = Ca¥ = (3.57 wF)(12.5 V) = 44.6 uC.

The series capacitors 12 and 3 in Fig. 25-10b each have the
same charge as their equivalent capacitor 123 (Fig. 25-10f).
Thus, capacitor 12 has charge qy2 = qi3 = 44.6 wC. From
Eg. 25-1 and Fig. 25-10g, the potential difference across ca-
pacitor 12 must be

The parallel capacitors 1 and 2 each have the same potential
difference as their equivalent capacitor 12 (Fig. 25-10h). Thus,
capacitor 1 has potential difference V; = Vj2 = 2.58 V, and,
from Eq. 25-1 and Fig. 25-10i, the charge on capacitor 1 must be

Sample Problem 25.03 One capacitor charging up another capacitor

Capacitor 1, with C, = 3.55 wF, is charged to a potential
difference Vp = 6.30 V, using a 6.30 V battery. The battery is
then removed, and the capacitor is connected as in Fig. 25-11
to an uncharged capacitor 2, with C) = 8.95 «F. When switch
S is closed, charge flows between the capacitors. Find the
charge on each capacitor when equilibrium is reached.

KEY IDEAS

 

The situation here differs from the previous example be-
cause here an applied electric potential is not maintained
across a combination of capacitors by a battery or some
other source. Here, just after switch S is closed, the only ap-
plied electric potential is that of capacitor 1 on capacitor 2,
and that potential is decreasing. Thus, the capacitors in
Fig. 25-11 are not connected in series; and although they are
drawn parallel, in this situation they are not in parallel.

As the electric potential across capacitor 1 decreases,
that across capacitor 2 increases. Equilibrium is reached
when the two potentials are equal because, with no potential
difference between connected plates of the capacitors, there

After the switch is closed,
charge is transferred until
the potential differences
match.
