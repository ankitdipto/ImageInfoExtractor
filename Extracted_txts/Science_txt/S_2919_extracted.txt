From this we see that the threshold energy corresponds to a potential of

Safety engineers attempt to keep the potential of the personnel below this level
by “bleeding” off the charge through, say, a conducting floor.

Energy Density

In a parallel-plate capacitor, neglecting fringing, the electric field has the same
value at all points between the plates. Thus, the energy density u—that is, the
potential energy per unit volume between the plates—should also be uniform.
We can find uw by dividing the total potential energy by the volume Ad of the
space between the plates. Using Eq. 25-22, we obtain

“Ad ~ 2Ad (25-23)
With Eq. 25-9 (C = epA/d), this result becomes

u = se (+) : (25-24)

However, from Eq. 24-42 (E = —AV/As), V/d equals the electric field magnitude E;so

u = Se 9E? (energy density). (25-25)

Although we derived this result for the special case of an electric field of a
parallel-plate capacitor, it holds for any electric field. If an electric field E ex-
ists at any point in space, that site has an electric potential energy with a den-

sity (amount per unit volume) given by Eq. 25-25.

Sample Problem 25.04 Potential energy and energy density of an electric field

An isolated conducting sphere whose radius R is 6.85 cm
has a charge gq = 1.25nC.

(b) What is the energy density at the surface of the sphere?

(a) How much potential energy is stored in the electric field KEWIDES

of this charged conductor?

 

The density u of the energy stored in an electric field

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) An isolated sphere has capacitance given by Eq. 25-18
(C =4reoR). (2) The energy U stored in a capacitor de-
pends on the capacitor’s charge q and capacitance C accord-
ing to Eq. 25-21 (U = q?/2C).
Calculation: Substituting C = 47re9R into Eq. 25-21 gives us
