DNA ofa single human chromosome. This chromosome has
been “exploded,” or relieved, of most of its packaging proteins.
The residual protein scaffolding appears as the dark material in
the lower part of the micrograph.

Eukaryotic DNA Replication

In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is packaged in nucleosomes
within chromosomes (figure 14.18). Each individual zone
of a chromosome replicates as a discrete section called a
replication unit, or replicon, which can vary in length
from 10,000 to 1 million base-pairs; most are about
100,000 base-pairs long. Each replication unit has its own
origin of replication, and multiple units may be undergo-
ing replication at any given time, as can be seen in elec-
tron micrographs of replicating chromosomes (figure
14.19). Each unit replicates in a way fundamentally simi-
lar to prokaryotic DNA replication, using similar en-
zymes. The advantage of having multiple origins of repli-
cation in eukaryotes is speed: replication takes
approximately eight hours in humans cells, but if there
were only one origin, it would take 100 times longer.
Regulation of the replication process ensures that only
one copy of the DNA is ultimately produced. How a cell
achieves this regulation is not yet completely clear. It
may involve periodic inhibitor or initiator proteins on the
DNA molecule itself.

 

Eukaryotic chromosomes have multiple origins of
replication.

FIGURE 14.19

Eukaryotic chromosomes possess numerous replication forks
spaced along their length. Four replication units (each with two
replication forks) are producing daughter strands (a) in this
electron micrograph, as indicated in red in the (b) corresponding
drawing.
