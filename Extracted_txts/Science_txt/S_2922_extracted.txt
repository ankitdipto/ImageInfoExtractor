25-5 CAPACITOR WITH A DIELECTRIC 733

Thus, the magnitude of the electric field produced by a point charge inside a

dielectric is given by this modified form of Eq. 23-15:

Also, the expression for the electric field just outside an isolated conductor

immersed in a dielectric (see Eq. 23-11) becomes

Because « is always greater than unity, both these equations show that for a fixed
distribution of charges, the effect of a dielectric is to weaken the electric field that

would otherwise be present.

Sample Problem 25.05 Work and energy when a dielectric is inserted into a capacitor

A parallel-plate capacitor whose capacitance C is 13.5 pF is
charged by a battery to a potential difference V = 12.5 V
between its plates. The charging battery is now discon-
nected, and a porcelain slab (x = 6.50) is slipped between
the plates.

(a) What is the potential energy of the capacitor before the
slab is inserted?

KEY IDEA

‘We can relate the potential energy U; of the capacitor to the
capacitance C and either the potential V (with Eq. 25-22) or
the charge q (with Eq. 25-21):

 

U=3CV? = se.

Calculation: Because we are given the initial potential V
(= 12.5 V), we use Eq. 25-22 to find the initial stored
energy:
U, = 3CV? = 5(13.5 x 10-7 F)(12.5 VP?
= 1.055 x 10°°J = 1055 pJ ~ 1100 pJ. (Answer)

(b) What is the potential energy of the capacitor—slab device
after the slab is inserted?

AILEY

KEY IDEA

Because the battery has been disconnected, the charge on
the capacitor cannot change when the dielectric is inserted.
However, the potential does change.

Calculations: Thus, we must now use Eq. 25-21 to write the
final potential energy U;, but now that the slab is within the
capacitor, the capacitance is «C. We then have
g¢ U; — 1055 pJ
U;p= eee
2«C kK 6.50
= 162 pJ ~ 160 pJ. (Answer)
When the slab is introduced, the potential energy decreases
by a factor of x.

The “missing” energy, in principle, would be apparent to
the person who introduced the slab. The capacitor would ex-
ert a tiny tug on the slab and would do work on it, in amount

W = U; — U;= (1055 — 162) pJ = 893 pJ.
If the slab were allowed to slide between the plates with no
restraint and if there were no friction, the slab would oscillate
back and forth between the plates with a (constant) mechani-
cal energy of 893 pJ, and this system energy would transfer
back and forth between kinetic energy of the moving slab and
potential energy stored in the electric field.

Dielectrics: An Atomic View

What happens, in atomic and molecular terms, when we put a dielectric in an
electric field? There are two possibilities, depending on the type of molecule:

1. Polar dielectrics. The molecules of some dielectrics, like water, have permanent
electric dipole moments. In such materials (called polar dielectrics), the
