CHAPTER 25 CAPACITANCE

The net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface in Fig. 25-16b is g — q',so
Gauss’ law now gives

af E-dA = EA=q-4'. (25-32)

q-q
or E= . 25-33
=A (25-33)

The effect of the dielectric is to weaken the original field Ey by a factor of «;so we
may write

p= fo 4, (25-34)

Comparison of Eqs. 25-33 and 25-34 shows that

Equation 25-35 shows correctly that the magnitude q’ of the induced surface
charge is less than that of the free charge q and is zero if no dielectric is present
(because then « = 1 in Eq. 25-35).

By substituting for g — q' from Eq. 25-35 in Eq. 25-32, we can write Gauss’
law in the form

af KE+dA = q Gauss’ lawwith dielectric). (25-36)

This equation, although derived for a parallel-plate capacitor, is true generally
and is the most general form in which Gauss’ law can be written. Note:

1. The flux integral now involves KE, not just E. (The vector eokE is sometimes
called the electric displacement D, so that Eg. 25-36 can be written in the form
§D-dA =q,)

2. The charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is now taken to be the free
charge only. The induced surface charge is deliberately ignored on the right
side of Eq. 25-36, having been taken fully into account by introducing the
dielectric constant « on the left side.

3. Equation 25-36 differs from Eq. 23-7, our original statement of Gauss’ law,
only in that 9 in the latter equation has been replaced by ep. We keep «
inside the integral of Eq. 25-36 to allow for cases in which « is not constant
over the entire Gaussian surface.

Sample Problem 25.06 Dielectric partially filling the gap in a capacitor

Figure 25-17 shows a parallel-plate capacitor of plate area
A and plate separation d. A potential difference Vp is ap-
plied between the plates by connecting a battery between
them. The battery is then disconnected, and a dielectric slab
of thickness b and dielectric constant « is placed between
the plates as shown. Assume A = 115 cm’, d = 1.24 cm,
Vo = 85.5 V,b = 0.780 cm, and « = 2.61.

inserted?
