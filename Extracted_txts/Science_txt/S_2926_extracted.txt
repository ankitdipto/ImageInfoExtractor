Calculation: From Eq. 25-9 we have
eA _ (885 X 10-2 F/m)(115 x 10-4 m2)

ar a 1.24 x 10m
= 821 x 10°” F = 8.21 pF. (Answer)
(b) What free charge appears on the plates?
Calculation: From Eq. 25-1,
q = QM = (8.21 X 10° F)(85.5 V)
= 7.02 x 107° C = 702 pC. (Answer)

Because the battery was disconnected before the slab was
inserted, the free charge is unchanged.

(c) What is the electric field Ey) in the gaps between the
plates and the dielectric slab?

KEY IDEA

 

‘We need to apply Gauss’ law, in the form of Eq. 25-36, to
Gaussian surface I in Fig. 25-17.

Calculations: That surface passes through the gap, and so it
encloses only the free charge on the upper capacitor plate.
Electric field pierces only the bottom of the Gaussian surface.
Because there the area vector dA and the field vector E, are
both directed downward, the dot product in Eq. 25-36 becomes

E):dA = EydA cos (0° = Ey dA.

Equation 25-36 then becomes

exEy $ dA=4q.

The integration now simply gives the surface area A of the
plate. Thus, we obtain

soxEyA = q,

 

or Eyg= _
egkA

‘We must put «= 1 here because Gaussian surface I does
not pass through the dielectric. Thus, we have

q | 7.02 x 10-C

Fo SKA ~ (885 X 10-2 Fim)(I)(115 x 10 me
0 ( (1)

= 6900 V/m = 6.90 kV/m. (Answer)

Note that the value of Ep does not change when the slab is
introduced because the amount of charge enclosed by
Gaussian surface I in Fig. 25-17 does not change.

(d) What is the electric field E, in the dielectric slab?

25-6 DIELECTRICS AND GAUSS’ LAW 737

KEY IDEA

 

Now we apply Gauss’ law in the form of Eq. 25-36 to
Gaussian surface II in Fig. 25-17.

Calculations: Only the free charge —q is in Eq. 25-36,so

nf xB -dA = —ekE,A = -q. (25-37)
The first minus sign in this equation comes from the dot
product E,-dA along the top of the Gaussian surface be-
cause now the field vector E, is directed downward and the
area vector dA (which, as always, points outward from the
interior of a closed Gaussian surface) is directed upward.
‘With 180° between the vectors, the dot product is negative.
Now « = 2.61.Thus, Eq. 25-37 gives us

q_ _ & _ 6.90kV/m

~ eykA Kk 2.61

= 2.64kV/m. (Answer)

(e) What is the potential difference V between the plates
after the slab has been introduced?

 

KEY IDEA

 

We find V by integrating along a straight line directly from
the bottom plate to the top plate.

Calculation: Within the dielectric, the path length is b and
the electric field is E,. Within the two gaps above and below
the dielectric, the total path length is d — b and the electric
field is Ey. Equation 25-6 then yields

+
v={ Eds = Ej(d — b) + E,b
= (6900 V/m)(0.0124 m — 0.00780 m)
+ (2640 V/m) (0.00780 m)
= 523V. (Answer)

This is less than the original potential difference of 85.5 V.
(£) What is the capacitance with the slab in place?

KEY IDEA

 

The capacitance Cis related to q and V via Eq. 25-1.
Calculation: Taking q from (b) and V from (e), we have

oa 4 = 102 X10 E
Vv 52.3 V
= 1.34 x 107" F = 13.4 pF. (Answer)

This is greater than the original capacitance of 8.21 pF.
