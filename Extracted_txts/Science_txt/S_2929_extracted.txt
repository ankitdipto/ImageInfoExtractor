electrons move to the plate face (area
A). In Fig, 25-26, the depth d from which
the electrons come in the plate in a par-
ticular capacitor is plotted against a
range of values for the potential differ-
ence V of the battery. The density of con-
duction electrons in the copper plates is

zontal scale is set by V, = 20.0 V. What is = -

°8 How many 1.00 uF capacitors must be connected in parallel to
store a charge of 1.00C with a potential of 110 V across the
capacitors?

*9 Each of the uncharged capaci-
tors in Fig. 25-27 has a capacitance
of 25.0 uF. A potential difference
of V = 4200 V is established when
the switch is closed. How many
coulombs of charge then pass
through meter A?

10 In Fig. 25-28, find the equiva-
lent capacitance of the combination. Assume that C, is 10.0 uF, C,
is 5.00 F, and CG is 4.00 nF.

**12 Two parallel-plate capacitors, 6.0 uF each, are connected in
parallel to a 10 V battery. One of the capacitors is then squeezed so
that its plate separation is 50.0% of its initial value. Because of the
squeezing, (a) how much additional charge is transferred to the ca-
pacitors by the battery and (b) what is the increase in the total
charge stored on the capacitors?

*°13 SSM ILW A 100 pF capacitor is charged to a potential dif-
ference of 50 V, and the charging battery is disconnected. The
capacitor is then connected in parallel with a second (initially
uncharged) capacitor. If the potential difference across the first

 

capacitor drops to 35 V, what is the capacitance of this second
capacitor?

14 © InFig 25-30, the battery has
a potential difference of V = 10.0 V
and the five capacitors each have a
capacitance of 10.0 uF. What is
the charge on (a) capacitor 1 and
(b) capacitor 2?

"15 © In Fig. 25-31, a 20.0 V bat-
tery is connected across capacitors
of capacitances C, = C, = 3.00 uF
and C; = Cs = 2.00C = 2.00C, = 4.00 uF. What are (a) the equiv-
alent capacitance C,, of the capacitors and (b) the charge stored by
Coq? What are (c) V; and (d) q; of capacitor 1, (e) V3 and (f) q2 of
capacitor 2, and (g) V3 and (h) q3 of capacitor 3?

on capacitor 1 versus the electric potential V set up across it. The
vertical scale is set by g, = 16.0 wC, and the horizontal scale is set
by V, = 2.0V. Plots 2 and 3 are similar plots for capacitors 2 and
3, respectively. Figure 25-32b shows a circuit with those three
capacitors and a 6.0 V battery. What is the charge stored on
capacitor 2 in that circuit?

that is connected to a larger circuit. The graph below the section shows
the electric potential V(x) as a function of position x along the lower
part of the section, through capacitor 4. Similarly, the graph above the
section shows the electric potential V(x) as a function of position x
along the upper part of the section, through capacitors 1,2, and 3.
