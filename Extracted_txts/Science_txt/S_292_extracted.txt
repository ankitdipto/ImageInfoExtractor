14.4 What is a gene?

The One-Gene/One-Polypeptide
Hypothesis

As the structure of DNA was being solved, other biologists

continued to puzzle over how the genes of Mendel were re-
lated to DNA.

Garrod: Inherited Disorders Can Involve Specific
Enzymes

In 1902, a British physician, Archibald Garrod, was work-
ing with one of the early Mendelian geneticists, his coun-
tryman William Bateson, when he noted that certain dis-
eases he encountered among his patients seemed to be
more prevalent in particular families. By examining sev-
eral generations of these families, he found that some of
the diseases behaved as if they were the product of simple
recessive alleles. Garrod concluded that these disorders
were Mendelian traits and that they had resulted from
changes in the hereditary information in an ancestor of
the affected families.

Garrod investigated several of these dis-
orders in detail. In alkaptonuria the pa-
tients produced urine that contained ho-

mogentisic acid (alkapton). This substance

Beadle and Tatum’s procedure for
isolating nutritional mutants in
Neurospora. This fungus grows easily on an
artificial medium in test tubes. In this
experiment, spores were irradiated to
increase the frequency of mutation; they
were then placed on a “complete” medium
that contained all of the nutrients necessary
for growth. Once the fungal colonies were
established on the complete medium,
individual spores were transferred to a
“minimal” medium that lacked various
substances the fungus could normally
manufacture. Any spore that would not grow
on the minimal medium but would grow on
the complete medium contained one or more
mutations in genes needed to produce the
missing nutrients. To determine which gene
had mutated, the minimal medium was
supplemented with particular substances.
The mutation illustrated here produced an
arginine mutant, a collection of cells that lost
the ability to manufacture arginine. These
cells will not grow on minimal medium but
will grow on minimal medium with only
arginine added.

oxidized rapidly when exposed to air, turning the urine
black. In normal individuals, homogentisic acid is broken
down into simpler substances. With considerable insight,
Garrod concluded that patients suffering from alkaptonuria
lacked the enzyme necessary to catalyze this breakdown.
He speculated that many other inherited diseases might
also reflect enzyme deficiencies.

Beadle and Tatum: Genes Specify Enzymes

From Garrod’s finding, it took but a short leap of intu-
ition to surmise that the information encoded within the
DNA of chromosomes acts to specify particular enzymes.
This point was not actually established, however, until
1941, when a series of experiments by Stanford University
geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum provided
definitive evidence on this point. Beadle and Tatum delib-
erately set out to create Mendelian mutations in chromo-
somes and then studied the effects of these mutations on
the organism (figure 14.20).
