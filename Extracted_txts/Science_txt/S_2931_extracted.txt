The company supplying a certain
liquid has been using a squat, cylin-
drical plastic container of radius
r = 0.20 m and filling it to height
A = 10cm, which is not the con-
tainer’s full interior height (Fig. 25-44). Your investigation reveals
that during handling at the company, the exterior surface of the
container commonly acquires a negative charge density of magni-
tude 2.0 4C/m? (approximately uniform). Because the liquid is a
conducting material, the charge on the container induces charge
separation within the liquid. (a) How much negative charge is
induced in the center of the liquid’s bulk? (b) Assume the capaci-
tance of the central portion of the liquid relative to ground is
35 pF. What is the potential energy associated with the negative
charge in that effective capacitor? (c) If a spark occurs between
the ground and the central portion of the liquid (through the vent-
ing port), the potential energy can be fed into the spark. The mini-
mum spark energy needed to ignite the liquid is 10 mJ. In this
situation, can a spark ignite the liquid?

37 SSM ILW WWW The parallel plates in a capacitor, with a
plate area of 8.50 cm? and an air-filled separation of 3.00 mm, are
charged by a 6.00 V battery. They are then disconnected from the
battery and pulled apart (without discharge) to a separation of
8.00 mm. Neglecting fringing, find (a) the potential difference be-
tween the plates, (b) the initial stored energy, (c) the final stored
energy, and (d) the work required to separate the plates.

38 In Fig. 25-29, a potential difference V = 100 V is applied
across a capacitor arrangement with capacitances C; = 10.0 uF,

tial difference V3, and (c) stored energy or capacitor 3, (d) qi,
(e) V;, and (f) U; for capacitor 1, and (g) qp, (h) V>, and (i) Uy for
capacitor 2?

39 © In Fig. 25-45, C, = 100 a irs
HE, C,= 20.0 uF, and C,=
25.0 uF. If no capacitor can
withstand a potential differ-
ence of more than 100 V without failure, what are (a) the magni-
tude of the maximum potential difference that can exist between
points A and B and (b) the maximum energy that can be stored in
the three-capacitor arrangement?

Module 25-5 Capacitor with a Dielectric

*40 An airtfilled parallel-plate capacitor has a capacitance of
1.3 pF The separation of the plates is doubled, and wax is inserted
between them. The new capacitance is 2.6 pF. Find the dielectric
constant of the wax.

°41 SSM A coaxial cable used in a transmission line has an inner
radius of 0.10 mm and an outer radius of 0.60 mm. Calculate the
capacitance per meter for the cable. Assume that the space
between the conductors is filled with polystyrene.

42 A parallel-plate air-filled capacitor has a capacitance of
50 pF. (a) If each of its plates has an area of 0.35 m’, what is the
separation? (b) If the region between the plates is now filled with
material having « = 5.6, what is the capacitance?

°43 Given a 74 pF air-filled capacitor, you are asked to convert it to
a capacitor that can store up to 7.4 J with a maximum potential dif-
ference of 652 V. Which dielectric in Table 25-1 should you use to fill
the gap in the capacitor if you do not allow for a margin of error?

44 You are asked to construct a capacitor having a capacitance
near 1 nF and a breakdown potential in excess of 10 000 V. You
think of using the sides of a tall Pyrex drinking glass as a dielectric,
lining the inside and outside curved surfaces with aluminum foil to
act as the plates. The glass is 15 cm tall with an inner radius of
3.6 cm and an outer radius of 3.8 cm. What are the (a) capacitance
and (b) breakdown potential of this capacitor?

45 A certain parallel-plate capacitor is filled with a dielectric
for which « = 5.5. The area of each plate is 0.034 m?, and the plates
are separated by 2.0 mm. The capacitor will fail (short out and burn
up) if the electric field between the plates exceeds 200 kN/C. What
is the maximum energy that can be stored in the capacitor?

“46 In Fig. 25-46, how much charge is
stored on the parallel-plate capacitors
by the 12.0V battery? One is filled
with air, and the other is filled with a di-
electric for which « = 3.00; both capaci-
tors have a plate area of 5.00 X 10-3 m?
and a plate separation of 2.00 mm.
