8.00 uF) connected to a 12.0 V battery. When switch S is closed so as
to connect uncharged capacitor 4 (C; = 6.00 uF), (a) how much
charge passes through point P from the battery and (b) how much
charge shows up on capacitor 4? (c) Explain the discrepancy in
those two results.

62 Two air-filled, parallel-plate capacitors are to be connected toa
10V battery, first individually, then in series, and then in parallel. In
those arrangements, the energy stored in the capacitors turns out to
be, listed least to greatest: 75 J, 100 pJ, 300 wJ, and 400 wJ. Of the
two capacitors, what is the (a) smaller and (b) greater capacitance?

63 Two parallel-plate capacitors, 6.0 ~F each, are connected
in series to a 10 V battery. One of the capacitors is then squeezed
so that its plate separation is halved. Because of the squeezing,
(a) how much additional charge is transferred to the capacitors by
the battery and (b) what is the increase in the total charge stored
on the capacitors (the charge on the positive plate of one capacitor
plus the charge on the positive plate of the other capacitor)?

67 A capacitor of capacitance C, =
6.00 yF is connected in series with a capacitor of capacitance C) =
4.00 yF, and a potential difference of 200 V is applied across the
pair. (a) Calculate the equivalent capacitance. What are (b) charge
q: and (c) potential difference V; on capacitor 1 and (d) qz and (e)
V) on capacitor 2?

68 Repeat Problem 67 for the same two capacitors but with them
now connected in parallel.

69 A certain capacitor is charged to a potential difference V. If
you wish to increase its stored energy by 10%, by what percentage
should you increase V?

mm, as shown in Fig, 25-57; the slab is,
exactly halfway between the plates.
(a) What is the capacitance after the
slab is introduced? (b) If a charge
q = 3.40 uC is maintained on the
plates, what is the ratio of the stored energy before to that after the
slab is inserted? (c) How much work is done on the slab as it is in-
serted? (d) Is the slab sucked in or must it be pushed in?

71 Repeat Problem 70, assuming that a potential difference V =
85.0 V, rather than the charge, is held constant.

V; on capacitor 1 and (c) qo and (d) V> on capacitor 2? The charged
capacitors are then disconnected from each other and from the
battery. Then the capacitors are reconnected with plates of the
same signs wired together (the battery is not used). What now are
(e) a1. &) Vi. (g) qo, and (h) V2? Suppose, instead, the capacitors
charged in part (a) are reconnected with plates of opposite signs
wired together. What now are (i) q;, (j) Vi. (k) qz,and (1) V>?

74 You have two plates of copper, a sheet of mica (thickness =
0.10 mm, « = 5.4), a sheet of glass (thickness = 2.0 mm, « = 7.0),
and a slab of paraffin (thickness = 1.0 cm, « = 2.0). To make a
parallel-plate capacitor with the largest C, which sheet should you
place between the copper plates?

 

75 A capacitor of unknown capacitance Cis charged to 100 V and
connected across an initially uncharged 60 «F capacitor. If the final
potential difference across the 60 4F capacitor is 40 V, what is C?

76 A 10 V battery is connected toa series of n capacitors, each of
capacitance 2.0 uF If the total stored energy is 25 J, what is 1?

77 SSM In Fig. 25-59, two parallel-
plate capacitors A and B are con-
nected in parallel across a 600V
battery. Each plate has area 80.0 cm”;

capacitor B and (b) the air of capacitor A. What are the free charge
densities o on the higher-potential plate of (c) capacitor A and
(d) capacitor B? (e) What is the induced charge density o' on the
top surface of the dielectric?

78 You have many 2.0 uF capacitors, each capable of with-
standing 200 V without undergoing electrical breakdown (in which
they conduct charge instead of storing it). How would you assem-
ble a combination having an equivalent capacitance of (a) 0.40 uF
and (b) 1.2 uF, each combination capable of withstanding 1000 V?
79 A parallel-plate capacitor has charge q and plate area A.
(a) By finding the work needed to increase the plate separation
from x to x + dx, determine the force between the plates. (Hint:
See Eq. 8-22.) (b) Then show that the force per unit area (the elec-
trostatic stress) acting on either plate is equal to the energy density
eE7/2 between the plates.

80 A capacitor is charged until its stored energy is 4.00 J. A sec-
ond capacitor is then connected to it in parallel. (a) If the charge
distributes equally, what is the total energy stored in the electric
fields? (b) Where did the missing energy go?
