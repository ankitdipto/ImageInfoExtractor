We substitute 10 electrons per molecule because a water
(HO) molecule contains 8 electrons in the single oxygen
atom and 1 electron in each of the two hydrogen atoms.

‘We can express the rate dN/dt in terms of the given vol-
ume flow rate dV/dt by first writing

“Molecules per mole” is Avogadro’s number N,. “Moles per
unit mass” is the inverse of the mass per mole, which is the
molar mass M of water. “Mass per unit volume” is the (mass)
density Pmas; of water. The volume per second is the volume
flow rate dV/dt. Thus, we have

CHAPTER 26 CURRENT AND RESISTANCE

Substituting this into the equation for i, we find

Ps = dV
i = 10EN\M™ Paras wank

We know that Avogadro’s number Na is 6.02 X 107 mole-
cules/mol, or 6.02 X 107 mol, and from Table 15-1 we
know that the density of water pga, under normal condi-
tions is 1000 kg/m*. We can get the molar mass of water from
the molar masses listed in Appendix F (in grams per mole):
We add the molar mass of oxygen (16 g/mol) to twice the
molar mass of hydrogen (1 g/mol), obtaining 18 g/mol =
0.018 kg/mol. So, the current of negative charge due to the
electrons in the water is

i = (10)(1.6 x 10-° C)(6.02 x 102 mol)
X (0.018 kg/mol)~1(1000 kg/m?)(450 x 10-6 m’/s)
= 2.41 X 107C/s = 2.41 x 107A

= 24.1 MA. (Answer)

This current of negative charge is exactly compensated by a
current of positive charge associated with the nuclei of the
three atoms that make up the water molecule. Thus, there is
no net flow of charge through the hose.

26-2 cuRRENT DENSITY

Learning Objectives

 

After reading this module, you should be able to...

26.05 Identify a current density and a current density vector.

26.06 For current through an area element on a cross section
through a conductor (such as a wire), identify the element's
area vector dA.

26.07 Find the current through a cross section of a conductor
by integrating the dot product of the current density
vector J’ and the element area vector dA over the
full cross section.

26.08 For the case where current is uniformly spread over
a cross section in a conductor, apply the relationship

Key Ideas

@ Current i (a scalar quantity) is related to current density T
(a vector quantity) by

i= | F-aA,

where dA is a vector perpendicular to a surface element
of area dA and the integral is taken over any surface
cutting across the conductor. The current density T has
the same direction as the velocity of the moving charges if

between the current i, the current density magnitude J,
and the area A.

26.09 Identify streamlines.

26.10 Explain the motion of conduction electrons in terms of
their drift speed.

26.11 Distinguish the drift speeds of conduction electrons from
their random-motion speeds, including relative magnitudes.

26.12 Identify carrier charge density n.

26.13 Apply the relationship between current density J,
charge carrier density n, and charge carrier drift speed vy.

they are positive and the opposite direction if they are
negative.

@ Whenan electric field E is established in a conductor, the
charge carriers (assumed positive) acquire a drift speed v, in
the direction of E.

@ The drift velocity V;, is related to the current density by
T= (eV

where ne is the carrier charge density.
