750 CHAPTER 26 CURRENT AND RESISTANCE

convenience, Fig. 26-5 shows the equivalent drift of positive charge carriers in the
direction of the applied electric field E. Let us assume that these charge carriers
all move with the same drift speed v, and that the current density J is uniform
across the wire’s cross-sectional area A. The number of charge carriers in a length
L of the wire is nAL, where n is the number of carriers per unit volume. The total
charge of the carriers in the length L, each with charge e,is then

= (nAL)e.
Because the carriers all move along the wire with speed v,, this total charge
moves through any cross section of the wire in the time interval
L

t=—
Va

Equation 26-1 tells us that the current i is the time rate of transfer of charge

across a cross section, so here we have

AL
is 4 = in = nAevy. (26-6)

Solving for vz and recalling Eq. 26-5 (J = i/A), we obtain

 

i J
Vy = =
a nAe ne
or, extended to vector form,
T = (ne)vy. (26-7)

Here the product ne, whose SI unit is the coulomb per cubic meter (C/m‘), is the
carrier charge density. For positive carriers, ne is positive and Eq. 26-7 predicts
that J and ¥, have the same direction. For negative carriers, ne is negative and T
and ¥, have opposite directions.

rightward: (a) the current i, (b) the current density
F, (c) the electric field E in the wire?

KEY IDEA a

 

Because the current density is uniform across the cross Born Eolas

section, the current density J, the current i, and the cross- i=JA'
sectional area A are related by Eq. 26-5 (J = i/A). and then substitute the data to find
Calculations: We want only the current through a reduced i= (2.0 x 10° A/m?)(9.424 x 107° m’)
