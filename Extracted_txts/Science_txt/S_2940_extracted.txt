(b) Suppose, instead, that the current density through a
cross section varies with radial distance r as J = ar’, in which
a= 3.0 x 10"! A/m* and r is in meters. What now is the
current through the same outer portion of the wire?

KEY IDEA

Because the current density is not uniform across a cross
section of the wire, we must resort to Eq. 26-4 (i = Ty: dA)
and integrate the current density over the portion of the
wire fromr = R/2 tor = R.

Calculations: The current density vector i (along the
wire’s length) and the differential area vector dA (per-
pendicular to a cross section of the wire) have the same
direction. Thus,

J-dA = JdAcos0 = JdA.

We want the current in the area
between these two radii.

26-2 CURRENT DENSITY 751

‘We need to replace the differential area dA with some-
thing we can actually integrate between the limits r = R/2
andr = R.The simplest replacement (because J is given as a
function of r) is the area 27rr dr of a thin ring of circumfer-
ence 2ar and width dr (Fig. 26-6b). We can then integrate
with r as the variable of integration. Equation 26-4 then
gives us

(Answer)

 

Its area is the product of the
circumference and the width.

(o

The current within the ring is
the product of the current density
and the ring’s area.

Our job is to sum the current in

all rings from this smallest one ...

Figure 26-6 (a) Cross section of a wire of

radius R. If the current density is uni-

form, the current is just the product of

the current density and the area. (b)-(e)

If the current is nonuniform, we must

first find the current through a thin ring

and then sum (via integration) the cur-

rents in all such rings in the given area. (@)

If the current is nonuniform, we start with a 6)
ring that is so thin that we can approximate
the current density as being uniform within it.
