754 CHAPTER 26 CURRENT AND RESISTANCE

Table 26-1 Resistivities of Some Materials As we have done several times in other connections, we often wish to take a
at Room Temperature (20°C) general view and deal not with particular objects but with materials. Here we do
SS so by focusing not on the potential difference V across a particular resistor but on
the electric field E at a point in a resistive material. Instead of dealing with the
current i through the resistor, we deal with the current density T at the point in

If we combine the SI units of E and J according to Eq. 26-10, we get, for the

Calculating Resistance from Resistivity
‘We have just made an important distinction:

te] Resistance is a property of an object. Resistivity is a property of a material.

If we know the resistivity of a substance such as copper, we can calculate the
resistance of a length of wire made of that substance. Let A be the cross-sectional
area of the wire, let L be its length, and let a potential difference V exist between

be constant for all points within the wire and, from Eqs. 24-42 and 26-5, will have
