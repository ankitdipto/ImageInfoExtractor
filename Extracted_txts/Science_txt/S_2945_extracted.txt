CHAPTER 26 CURRENT AND RESISTANCE

Sample Problem 26.04 A material has resistivity, a block of the material has resistance

A rectangular block of iron has dimensions 1.2 cm x
1.2 cm X 15 cm.A potential difference is to be applied to
the block between parallel sides and in such a way that
those sides are equipotential surfaces (as in Fig. 26-8)).
What is the resistance of the block if the two parallel
sides are (1) the square ends (with dimensions 1.2 cm X
1.2 cm) and (2) two rectangular sides (with dimensions
1.2 cm x 15 cm)?

KEY IDEA

 

The resistance R of an object depends on how the electric
potential is applied to the object. In particular, it depends
on the ratio L/A, according to Eq. 26-16 (R = pL/A),
where A is the area of the surfaces to which the potential
difference is applied and L is the distance between those
surfaces.

Calculations: For arrangement 1, we have L = 15 cm=
0.15 m and

A = (1.2 cm)? = 1.44 x 10-4 m’.
Substituting into Eq. 26-16 with the resistivity » from
Table 26-1, we then find that for arrangement 1,

Ra BE. — 068 x 10-*.O-m)(0.15 m)
— A 1.44 x 10-4 m?

=1.0 x 1040 = 10020. (Answer)

Similarly, for arrangement 2, with distance L = 1.2 cm
and area A = (1.2 cm)(15 cm), we obtain
pL _ (9.68 X 10 *O-m)(1.2 x 10? m)
A 1.80 x 10-4 m?
= 6.5 X 10°70 = 0.65 uO.

Key Ideas

@ A given device (conductor, resistor, or any other
electrical device) obeys Ohm's law if its resistance

R (= V/i) is independent of the applied potential
difference V.

@ A given material obeys Ohm's law if its resistivity p (= E//)
is independent of the magnitude and direction of the applied
electric field E.

@ The assumption that the conduction electrons in a metal
are free to move like the molecules in a gas leads to an

Ohm’s Law

26.25 For the conduction electrons in a conductor, explain
the relationship between the mean free time 7, the effective
speed, and the thermal (random) motion.

26.26 Apply the relationship between resistivity p, number
density n of conduction electrons, and the mean free time
7 of the electrons.

expression for the resistivity of a metal:

eenr*
Here n is the number of free electrons per unit volume and 7
is the mean time between the collisions of an electron with
the atoms of the metal.

@ Metals obey Ohm's law because the mean free time vis
approximately independent of the magnitude E of any electric
field applied to a metal.

As we just discussed, a resistor is a conductor with a specified resistance. It has
that same resistance no matter what the magnitude and direction (polarity) of
the applied potential difference are. Other conducting devices, however, might
have resistances that change with the applied potential difference.
