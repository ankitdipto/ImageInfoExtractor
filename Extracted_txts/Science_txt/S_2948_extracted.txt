Equation 26-22 may be taken as a statement that metals obey Ohm’s law if we
can show that, for metals, their resistivity p is a constant, independent of the
strength of the applied electric field E. Let’s consider the quantities in Eq. 26-22.
We can reasonably assume that n, the number of conduction electrons per vol-
ume, is independent of the field, and m and e are constants. Thus, we only need to
convince ourselves that 7, the average time (or mean free time) between colli-
sions, is a constant, independent of the strength of the applied electric field.
Indeed, rcan be considered to be a constant because the drift speed vz caused by
the field is so much smaller than the effective speed V.¢; that the electron speed —
and thus t—is hardly affected by the field. Thus, because the right side of
Eq. 26-22 is independent of the field magnitude, metals obey Ohm’s law.

(a) What is the mean free time 7 between collisions for the
conduction electrons in copper?

KEY IDEAS

 

The mean free time 7 of copper is approximately constant,
and in particular does not depend on any electric field that
might be applied to a sample of the copper. Thus, we need
not consider any particular value of applied electric field.
However, because the resistivity p displayed by copper
under an electric field depends on +, we can find the mean
free time 7 from Eq. 26-22 (p = mle’nz).

Calculations: That equation gives us

The number of conduction electrons per unit volume in cop-
peris 8.49 x 1075 m™3. We take the value of p from Table 26-1.
The denominator then becomes
(8.49 x 1078 m™)(1.6 x 10-” C)°(1.69 x 10-$O-m)
= 3.67 x 10-17 C?-O/m? = 3.67 x 10" kg/s,

(b) The mean free path A of the conduction electrons in a
conductor is the average distance traveled by an electron
between collisions. (This definition parallels that in
Module 19-5 for the mean free path of molecules in a gas.)
What is A for the conduction electrons in copper, assuming
that their effective speed v.y is 1.6 X 10° m/s?

KEY IDEA

The distance d any particle travels in a certain time ¢ at a
constant speed v is d = vt.

Calculation: For the electrons in copper, this gives us

A= use (26-24)
= (1.6 X 10° mis)(2.5 x 10-s)
= 4.0 x 10m = 40 nm. (Answer)

This is about 150 times the distance between nearest-
neighbor atoms in a copper lattice. Thus, on the average,
each conduction electron passes many copper atoms before
finally hitting one.
