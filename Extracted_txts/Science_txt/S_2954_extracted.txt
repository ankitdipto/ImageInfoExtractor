Module 26-1 Electric Current

*1 During the 4.0 min a 5.0A current is set up in a wire, how
many (a) coulombs and (b) electrons pass through any cross sec-
tion across the wire’s width?

#2 An isolated conducting sphere has a 10cm radius. One wire
carries a current of 1.000 0020 A into it. Another wire carries a
current of 1.000 000 0 A out of it. How long would it take for the
sphere to increase in potential by 1000 V?

#3) A charged belt, 50 cm wide, travels at 30 m/s between a source of
charge anda sphere. The belt carries charge into the sphere at a rate cor-
responding to 100 7A. Compute the surface charge density on the belt.

Module 26-2 Current Density

#4 The (United States) National Electric Code, which sets maxi-
mum safe currents for insulated copper wires of various diameters,
is given (in part) in the table. Plot the safe current density as a
function of diameter. Which wire gauge has the maximum safe cur-
rent density? (“Gauge” is a way of identifying wire diameters, and
1mil = 10-
