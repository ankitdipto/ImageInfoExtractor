°7 A fuse in an electric circuit is a wire that is designed to melt,
and thereby open the circuit, if the current exceeds a predeter-
mined value. Suppose that the material to be used in a fuse melts
when the current density rises to 440 A/cm’. What diameter of
cylindrical wire should be used to make a fuse that will limit the
current to 0.50 A?

*8 A small but measurable current of 1.2 x 107" A exists in a
copper wire whose diameter is 2.5 mm. The number of charge carri-
ers per unit volume is 8.49 X 1078 m~>. Assuming the current is uni-
form, calculate the (a) current density and (b) electron drift speed.

#9)\The magnitude J(r) of the current density in a certain cylin-
drical wire is given as a function of radial distance from the center
of the wire’s cross section as J(r) = Br, where r is in meters, J is in
amperes per square meter, and B = 2.00 X 10° A/m}. This function
applies out to the wire’s radius of 2.00 mm. How much current is
contained within the width of a thin ring concentric with the wire if
the ring has a radial width of 10.0 um and is at a radial distance of
1.20 mm?

#10 The magnitude J of the current density in a certain lab
wire with a circular cross section of radius R = 2.00 mm is given by
J = (3.00 X 108)r2, with J in amperes per square meter and radial
distance r in meters. What is the current through the outer section
bounded by r = 0.900R andr = R?

magnitude of the current density is given by (a) J; = Jor/R and
(b) Jy = Jo(1 — r/R), in which r is the radial distance and Jy =
5.50 X 10* A/m?? (c) Which function maximizes the current
density near the wire’s surface?

(a stream of particles from the Sun) is 8.70 cm~, and their speed
is 470 km/s. (a) Find the current density of these protons. (b) If
Earth’s magnetic field did not deflect the protons, what total cur-
rent would Earth receive?

*°13 @_ tw How long does it take electrons to get from a car
battery to the starting motor? Assume the current is 300 A and the
electrons travel through a copper wire with cross-sectional area
0.21 cm? and length 0.85 m. The number of charge carriers per unit
volume is 8.49 X 1075 m™.

Module 26-3 Resistance and Resistivity

°14 <= A human being can be electrocuted if a current as
small as 50 mA passes near the heart. An electrician working
with sweaty hands makes good contact with the two conductors
he is holding, one in each hand. If his resistance is 2000 , what
might the fatal voltage be?

*15 ssm A coil is formed by winding 250 turns of insulated
16-gauge copper wire (diameter = 1.3mm) in a single layer
on a cylindrical form of radius 12cm. What is the resistance
of the coil? Neglect the thickness of the insulation. (Use Table 26-1.)

"EN Copper and aluminum are being considered for a
high-voltage transmission line that must carry a current of 60.0 A.
The resistance per unit length is to be 0.150 0/km. The densities of
copper and aluminum are 8960 and 2600 kg/m‘, respectively.
Compute (a) the magnitude J of the current density and (b) the
mass per unit length A for a copper cable and (c) J and (d) A for an
aluminum cable.

CHAPTER 26 CURRENT AND RESISTANCE

°17_ A wire of Nichrome (a nickel—chromium-iron alloy com-
monly used in heating elements) is 1.0 m long and 1.0 mm? in
cross-sectional area. It carries a current of 4.0 A when a 2.0 V
potential difference is applied between its ends. Calculate the
conductivity o of Nichrome.

°18 A wire 4.00 m long and 6.00 mm in diameter has a resistance
of 15.0 mQ. A potential difference of 23.0 V is applied between the
ends. (a) What is the current in the wire? (b) What is the magnitude
of the current density? (c) Calculate the resistivity of the wire ma-
terial. (d) Using Table 26-1, identify the material.

*19 SSM What is the resistivity of a wire of 1.0 mm diameter, 2.0m
length, and 50 mQ resistance?

°20 A certain wire has a resistance R. What is the resistance of a
second wire, made of the same material, that is half as long and has
half the diameter?

21 tw A common flashlight bulb is rated at 0.30 A and 2.9 V
(the values of the current and voltage under operating conditions).
If the resistance of the tungsten bulb filament at room temperature
(20°C) is 1.1 ©, what is the temperature of the filament when the
bulb is on?

822 <*= Kiting during a storm. The legend that Benjamin
Franklin flew a kite as a storm approached is only a legend—he
was neither stupid nor suicidal. Suppose a kite string of radius
2.00 mm extends directly upward by 0.800 km and is coated with a
0.500 mm layer of water having resistivity 150 Q- m. If the potential
difference between the two ends of the string is 160 MV, what is the
current through the water layer? The danger is not this current but
the chance that the string draws a lightning strike, which can have a
current as large as 500 000 A (way beyond just being lethal).

23 When 115 V is applied across a wire that is 10 m long and
has a 0.30 mm radius, the magnitude of the current density is 1.4 x
10 A/m?. Find the resistivity of the wire.

"24°@ Figure 26-25a gives the magnitude E(x) of the electric
fields that have been set up by a battery along a resistive rod of
length 9.00 mm (Fig. 26-255). The vertical scale is set by E, = 4.00 x
10° V/m. The rod consists of three sections of the same material but
with different radii. (The schematic diagram of Fig. 26-25b does not
indicate the different radii.) The radius of section 3 is 2.00 mm.
