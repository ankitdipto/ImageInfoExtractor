*39 A certain brand of hot-dog cooker works by applying a
potential difference of 120 V across opposite ends of a hot dog
and allowing it to cook by means of the thermal energy
produced. The current is 10.0 A, and the energy required to
cook one hot dog is 60.0kJ. If the rate at which energy is
supplied is unchanged, how long will it take to cook three hot
dogs simultaneously?

to the other, (a) in which direction in the fig-
ure does the electron move, (b) how much
work is done on the electron by the electric
field in the strip, and (c) how much energy is transferred to the
thermal energy of the strip by the electron?

48 <= Exploding shoes. The rain-soaked shoes of a person
may explode if ground current from nearby lightning vaporizes
the water. The sudden conversion of water to water vapor
causes a dramatic expansion that can rip apart shoes. Water has

horizontal current lasts 2.00 ms and encounters water with resis-
tivity 150 O-m, length 12.0 cm, and vertical cross-sectional area
15 X 10-5 m’, what average current is required to vaporize the
water?
