54 © Figure 26-36a shows a rod
of resistive material. The resistance
per unit length of the rod increases (0)
in the positive direction of the x axis.
At any position x along the rod, the
resistance dR of a narrow (differen-
tial) section of width dy is given by
dR = 5.00x dx, where dR is in ohms
and x is in meters. Figure 26-365 Figure 26-36 Problem 54.

shows such a narrow section. You are to slice off a length of the rod
between x = 0 and some position x = L and then connect that length
to a battery with potential difference V = 5.0 V (Fig. 26-36c). You
want the current in the length to transfer energy to thermal energy
at the rate of 200 W. At what position x = L should you cut the rod?

55 ssm A Nichrome heater dissipates 500 W when the applied
potential difference is 110 V and the wire temperature is 800°C.
What would be the dissipation rate if the wire temperature were
held at 200°C by immersing the wire in a bath of cooling oil? The

60 <$m= The chocolate crumb mystery. This story begins with
Problem 60 in Chapter 23 and continues through Chapters 24 and
25.The chocolate crumb powder moved to the silo through a pipe of
radius R with uniform speed v and uniform charge density p.
(a) Find an expression for the current i (the rate at which charge on
the powder moved) through a perpendicular cross section of the
pipe. (b) Evaluate i for the conditions at the factory: pipe radius R =
5.0 cm, speed v = 2.0 ns, and charge density p = 1.1 x 10-5 C/m’.

If the powder were to flow through a change V in electric
potential, its energy could be transferred to a spark at the rate
P =iV.(c) Could there be such a transfer within the pipe due to the
radial potential difference discussed in Problem 70 of Chapter 24?

As the powder flowed from the pipe into the silo, the electric
potential of the powder changed. The magnitude of that change was
at least equal to the radial potential difference within the pipe (as
evaluated in Problem 70 of Chapter 24). (d) Assuming that value for
the potential difference and using the current found in (b) above,
find the rate at which energy could have been transferred from the
powder to a spark as the powder exited the pipe. (e) If a spark did
occur at the exit and lasted for 0.20s (a reasonable expectation),
how much energy would have been transferred to the spark? Recall

150 mJ is needed to cause an explosion. (f) Where did the powder
explosion most likely occur: in the powder cloud at the unloading
bin (Problem 60 of Chapter 25), within the pipe, or at the exit of
the pipe into the silo?

of the new length to L and (b) the ratio of the new cross-sectional
area to A?
