¢ Eukaryotic cells store hereditary information within
the nucleus.

¢ In viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes, the hereditary
information resides in nucleic acids. The transfer of
nucleic acids can lead to the transfer of hereditary
traits.

© When radioactively labeled DNA viruses infect
bacteria, the DNA but not the protein coat of the
viruses enters the bacterial cells, indicating that the
hereditary material is DNA rather than protein.

14.2. What is the structure of DNA?

1. In Hammerling’s experiments
on Acetabularia, what happened
when a stalk from A. arenulata
was grafted to a foot from A.
mediterranea?

2. How did Hershey and Chase
determine which component of
bacterial viruses contains the
viruses’ hereditary information?

* Chargaff showed that the proportion of adenine in
DNA always equals that of thymine, and the
proportion of guanine always equals that of cytosine.

¢ DNA has the structure of a double helix, consisting of
two chains of nucleotides held together by hydrogen
bonds between adenines and thymines, and between
guanines and cytosines.

14.3, How does DNA replicate?

3. What is the three-
dimensional shape of DNA, and
how does this shape fit with
Chargaff’s observations on the
proportions of purines and
pyrimidines in DNA?

4. How did Meselson and Stahl
show that DNA replication is

semiconservative?

* During the S phase of the cell cycle, the hereditary
message in DNA is replicated with great accuracy.

* During replication, the DNA duplex is unwound, and
two new strands are assembled in opposite directions
along the original strands. One strand elongates by
the continuous addition of nucleotides to its growing
end; the other is constructed by the addition of
segments containing 100 to 2000 nucleotides, which
are then joined to the end of that strand.

14.4 What isa gene?

5. How is the leading strand of a
DNA duplex replicated? How is
the lagging strand replicated?
What is the basis for the
requirement that the leading and
lagging strands be replicated by
different mechanisms?

* Most hereditary traits reflect the actions of enzymes.

¢ The traits are hereditary because the information
necessary to specify the structure of the enzymes is
stored within the DNA.

* Each enzyme is encoded by a specific region of the
DNA called a gene.

6. What hypothesis did Beadle
and Tatum test in their
experiments on Neurospora?
What did they do to change the
DNA in individuals of this
organism? How did they
determine whether any of these
changes affected enzymes in
biosynthetic pathways?
