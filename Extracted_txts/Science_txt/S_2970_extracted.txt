equivalent resistors, until the current through the battery
can be determined, and then reverse the steps to find
the currents and potential differences of the individual
resistors.

27.23 If a circuit cannot be simplified by using equivalent
resistors, identify the several loops in the circuit, choose
names and directions for the currents in the branches, set
up loop equations for the various loops, and solve these
simultaneous equations for the unknown currents.

27.24 In a circuit with identical real batteries in series, replace
them with a single ideal battery and a single resistor.

27.25 In a circuit with identical real batteries in parallel, re-
place them with a single ideal battery and a single resistor.

Key Idea

@ When resistances are in parallel, they have the same potential difference. The equivalent resistance that can replace a parallel
combination of resistances is given by

— _ (nresistances in parallel).

Multiloop Circuits

Figure 27-9 shows a circuit containing more than one loop. For simplicity, we
assume the batteries are ideal. There are two junctions in this circuit, at b and d,
and there are three branches connecting these junctions. The branches are the left
branch (bad), the right branch (bcd), and the central branch (bd). What are the
currents in the three branches?

We arbitrarily label the currents, using a different subscript for each branch.
Current i; has the same value everywhere in branch bad, i, has the same value
everywhere in branch bed, and i; is the current through branch bd. The directions
of the currents are assumed arbitrarily.

Consider junction d for a moment: Charge comes into that junction via
incoming currents i, and i, and it leaves via outgoing current i. Because there is
no variation in the charge at the junction, the total incoming current must equal
the total outgoing current:

The current into the junction
must equal the current out
(charge is conserved).

i +i =i. (27-18)

You can easily check that applying this condition to junction b leads to exactly
the same equation. Equation 27-18 thus suggests a general principle:

o JUNCTION RULE: The sum of the currents entering any junction must be
equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction.

 

Figure 27-9 A multiloop circuit consisting of
three branches: left-hand branch bad, right-
hand branch bed, and central branch bd.
The circuit also consists of three loops: left-
hand loop badb, right-hand loop bedb, and
big loop badcb.

This rule is often called Kirchhoff’s junction rule (or Kirchhoff's current law). It is
simply a statement of the conservation of charge for a steady flow of charge—
there is neither a buildup nor a depletion of charge at a junction. Thus, our basic
tools for solving complex circuits are the Joop rule (based on the conservation of
energy) and the junction rule (based on the conservation of charge).
