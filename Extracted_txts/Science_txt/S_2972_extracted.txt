27-2 MULTILOOP CIRCUITS 783

o Resistances connected in parallel can be replaced with an equivalent resistance
R., that has the same potential difference V and the same fofal current i as the
actual resistances.

You might remember that R., and all the actual parallel resistances have the
same potential difference V with the nonsense word “par-V.”
To derive an expression for R., in Fig. 27-100, we first write the current in
each actual resistance in Fig. 27-10a as
Vv Vv Vv

ha Re DR and BR
where V is the potential difference between a and b. If we apply the junction rule
at point a in Fig. 27-10a and then substitute these values, we find

i=itit+b=V V(E+EE) (27-21)
If we replaced the parallel combination with the equivalent resistance Req
(Fig. 27-10), we would have

Comparing Eqs. 27-21 and 27-22 leads to

Extending this result to the case of n resistances, we have

For the case of two resistances, the equivalent resistance is their product divided

by their sum; that is,

RiRy
Ri + Ry”
Note that when two or more resistances are connected in parallel, the equivalent

resistance is smaller than any of the combining resistances. Table 27-1 summarizes the
equivalence relations for resistors and capacitors in series and in parallel.

Iv] Checkpoint 4

A battery, with potential V across it, is connected to a combination of two identical re-
sistors and then has current i through it. What are the potential difference across and
the current through either resistor if the resistors are (a) in series and (b) in parallel?
