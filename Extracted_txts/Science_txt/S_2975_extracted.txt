786 CHAPTER 27 CIRCUITS

Sample Problem 27.03 Many real batteries in series and in parallel in an electric fish

Electric fish can generate current with biological emf cells
called electroplaques. In the South American eel they are
arranged in 140 rows, each row stretching horizontally along
the body and each containing 5000 cells, as suggested by
Fig. 27-12a. Each electroplaque has an emf € of 0.15 V and
an internal resistance r of 0.25 ©. The water surrounding the
eel completes a circuit between the two ends of the electro-
plaque array, one end at the head of the animal and the
other near the tail. eS

(a) If the surrounding water has resistance R,, = 800 0, how
much current can the eel produce in the water?

KEY IDEA

‘We can simplify the circuit of Fig. 27-12a by replacing
combinations of emfs and internal resistances with equiva-
lent emfs and resistances.

Calculations: We first consider a single row. The total emf
“Eow along a row of 5000 electroplaques is the sum of the emfs:

Erow = 50008 = (5000) (0.15 V) = 750 V.

First, reduce each row to one emf and one resistance.

EWE

 

The total resistance R,,y along a row is the sum of the inter-
nal resistances of the 5000 electroplaques:

Reow = 5000r = (5000)(0.25.Q) = 1250.0.

‘We can now represent each of the 140 identical rows as hav-
ing a single emf €,,y and a single resistance Row (Fig. 27-12b).

In Fig. 27-12b, the emf between point a and point b on
any row is ,oy = 750 V. Because the rows are identical and
because they are all connected together at the left in
Fig. 27-125, all points b in that figure are at the same electric
potential. Thus, we can consider them to be connected so
that there is only a single point b. The emf between point a
and this single point b is €,oy = 750 V, so we can draw the
circuit as shown in Fig. 27-12c.

Between points b and c in Fig. 27-12c are 140 resistances
Row = 1250 O, all in parallel. The equivalent resistance Req
of this combination is given by Eq. 27-24 as
