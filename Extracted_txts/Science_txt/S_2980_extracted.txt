Equation 27-39 tells us that g decreases exponentially with time, at arate that
is set by the capacitive time constant r= RC. At time f= +, the capacitor’s
charge has been reduced to qge!, or about 37% of the initial value. Note that a
greater 7meansa greater discharge time.

Differentiating Eq. 27-39 gives us the current i(¢):

is a = -(Be ern (discharging a capacitor). (27-40)
This tells us that the current also decreases exponentially with time, at a rate set
by +. The initial current ig is equal to go/RC. Note that you can find ij by simply
applying the loop rule to the circuit at t = 0; just then the capacitor’s initial poten-
tial Vo is connected across the resistance R, so the current must be iy = Vo/R =
(qo/C)/R = qo/RC. The minus sign in Eq. 27-40 can be ignored; it merely means
that the capacitor’s charge q is decreasing.

Derivation of Eq. 27-33

To solve Eq. 27-32, we first rewrite it as

dq qd €
+a =: 27-41
dt RC R ( )
The general solution to this differential equation is of the form
q=4p+ Ke, (27-42)

where q, is a particular solution of the differential equation, K is a constant to
be evaluated from the initial conditions, and a = 1/RC is the coefficient of g in
Eq. 27-41. To find qp, we set dg/dt = 0 in Eq. 27-41 (corresponding to the final
condition of no further charging), let g = gp, and solve, obtaining

Ip = CE. (27-43)
To evaluate K, we first substitute this into Eq. 27-42 to get
q=Cé+ Ke.

Then substituting the initial conditions g = 0 and t = 0 yields
0=Cé+K,
or K = —C€. Finally, with the values of Ip 4s and K inserted, Eq. 27-42 becomes
q= CE — CEe tke,
which, with a slight modification, is Eq. 27-33.

The table gives four sets of values for the circuit elements in Fig. 27-15. Rank the
sets according to (a) the initial current (as the switch is closed on a) and (b) the time
required for the current to decrease to half its initial value, greatest first.
