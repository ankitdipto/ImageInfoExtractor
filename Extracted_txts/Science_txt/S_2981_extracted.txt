Sample Problem 27.05 Discharging an RC circuit to avoid a fire in a race car pit stop

As a car rolls along pavement, electrons move from the
pavement first onto the tires and then onto the car body. The
car stores this excess charge and the associated electric poten-
tial energy as if the car body were one plate of a capacitor and
the pavement were the other plate (Fig. 27-17a). When the car
stops, it discharges its excess charge and energy through the
tires, just as a capacitor can discharge through a resistor. If a
conducting object comes within a few centimeters of the car
before the car is discharged, the remaining energy can be
suddenly transferred to a spark between the car and the
object. Suppose the conducting object is a fuel dispenser. The
spark will not ignite the fuel and cause a fire if the spark
energy is less than the critical value Us,. = 50 mJ.

‘When the car of Fig. 27-17a stops at time tf = 0, the car—
ground potential difference is Vj = 30 kV. The car—ground
capacitance is C = 500 pF, and the resistance of each tire is
Rice = 100 GO. How much time does the car take to discharge
through the tires to drop below the critical value Uj,.? a=

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) At any time ¢, a capacitor’s stored electric potential energy U
is related to its stored charge q according to Eq. 25-21 (U=
@/2C). (2) While a capacitor is discharging, the charge de-
creases with time according to Eq.27-39 (q = qoe~"*°).

Calculations: We can treat the tires as resistors that are
connected to one another at their tops via the car body and
at their bottoms via the pavement. Figure 27-17b shows how
the four resistors are connected in parallel across the car’s
capacitance, and Fig. 27-17c shows their equivalent resist-
ance R. From Eq. 27-24, R is given by

‘When the car stops, it discharges its excess charge and
energy through R. We now use our two Key Ideas to analyze
the discharge. Substituting Eq. 27-39 into Eq. 25-21 gives

From Eq. 25-1 (q = CV), we can relate the initial charge go
on the car to the given initial potential difference Vo: qo =

Fire or no fire: This car requires at least 9.4 s before fuel can be
brought safely near it.A pit crew cannot wait that long. So the
tires include some type of conducting material (such as carbon
black) to lower the tire resistance and thus increase the dis-
charge rate. Figure 27-17d shows the stored energy U versus
time ¢ for tire resistances of R = 100 GQ, (our value) and R =
10 GQ. Note how much more rapidly a car discharges to level
Uyce With the lower R value.
