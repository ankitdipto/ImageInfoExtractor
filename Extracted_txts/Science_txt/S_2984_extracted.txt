Module 27-1 Single-Loop Circuits
*1 ssmM www In Fig. 27-25, the ideal
batteries have emfs €;=12V and
‘€) = 6.0 V. What are (a) the current,
the dissipation rate in (b) resistor 1 (4.0
Q) and (c) resistor 2 (8.0 Q), and the en-
ergy transfer rate in (d) battery 1 and
(e) battery 2? Is energy being supplied
or absorbed by (£) battery 1 and (g) bat-
tery 2?

°2 In Fig. 27-26, the ideal batteries
have emfs €,=150V and €,=50V
and the resistances are R, = 3.0 0 and
R, = 2.0 ©. If the potential at P is 100 V,
what is it at O?

°3 iLw A car battery with a 12 V emf
and an internal resistance of 0.040 Q is
being charged with a current of 50 A.
What are (a) the potential difference V across the terminals, (b)
the rate P, of energy dissipation inside the battery, and (c) the rate
Peng Of energy conversion to chemical form? When the battery is
used to supply 50 A to the starter motor, what are (d) V and (e) P.?

°4 @ Figure 27-27 shows a circuit of four resistors that are con-
nected to a larger circuit. The graph below the circuit shows the
electric potential V(x) as a function of position x along the lower
branch of the circuit, through resistor 4; the potential V, is 12.0 V.
The graph above the circuit shows the electric potential V(x)
versus position x along the upper branch of the circuit, through
resistors 1,2, and 3; the potential differences are AV, = 2.00 V and
AVc = 5.00 V. Resistor 3 has a resistance of 200 ©. What is the
resistance of (a) resistor 1 and (b) resistor 2?

able battery with a 6.0 V emf. By how much is the chemical energy
of the battery reduced?

 

 

°6 A standard flashlight battery can deliver about 2.0 W-h of
energy before it runs down. (a) If a battery costs US$0.80, what is
the cost of operating a 100 W lamp for 8.0h using batteries?
(b) What is the cost if energy is provided at the rate of US$0.06 per
kilowatt-hour?

°7 Aire of resistance 5.0 0 is connected to a battery whose emf
‘€ is 2.0 V and whose internal resistance is 1.0 ©. In 2.0 min, how
much energy is (a) transferred from chemical form in the battery,
(b) dissipated as thermal energy in the wire, and (c) dissipated as
thermal energy in the battery?

°8 Acertain car battery with a 12.0 V emf has an initial charge of
120 A-h. Assuming that the potential across the terminals stays
constant until the battery is completely discharged, for how many
hours can it deliver energy at the rate of 100 W?

*9 (a) In electron-volts, how much work does an ideal battery
with a 12.0 V emf do on an electron that passes through the battery
from the positive to the negative terminal? (b) If 3.40 X 10'* elec-
trons pass through each second, what is the power of the battery in
watts?

must R have if the current in the
circuit is to be 1.0 mA? Take €, = 2.0

ergy appears in R?

tion AB absorbs energy at a rate of

tween A and B? Emf device X lacks

the negative terminal?

Wire 1

    
   

12 Figure 27-30 shows a resistor of resis-
tance R = 6.00 2 connected to an ideal battery
of emf € = 12.0V by means of two copper
wires. Each wire has length 20.0 cm and radius
1.00 mm. In dealing with such circuits in this
chapter, we generally neglect the potential
differences along the wires and the transfer of
energy to thermal energy in them. Check
the validity of this neglect for the circuit of
Fig. 27-30: What is the potential difference
across (a) the resistor and (b) each of the two sections of wire?
At what rate is energy lost to thermal energy in (c) the resistor
and (d) each section of wire?
