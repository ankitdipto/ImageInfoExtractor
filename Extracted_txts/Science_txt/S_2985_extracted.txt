a conducting path of resistance R
connects the wires (Fig. 27-31).The wes.
resistance of the wires and the short
is then 100 © when measured from
the east end and 200 when meas-
ured from the west end. What are
(a) x and (b) R?

14 @ In Fig. 27-32a, both batteries have emf € = 1.20 V and the
external resistance R is a variable resistor. Figure 27-32b gives the
electric potentials V between the terminals of each battery as func-
tions of R: Curve 1 corresponds to battery 1, and curve 2 corre-
sponds to battery 2. The horizontal scale is set by R, = 0.20 0. What
is the internal resistance of (a) battery 1 and (b) battery 2?

°°15 ILW The current in a single-loop circuit with one resistance R
is 5.0 A. When an additional resistance of 2.0 Q is inserted in series
with R, the current drops to 4.0 A. What is R?

16 A solar cell generates a potential difference of 0.10 V when
a 500 © resistor is connected across it, and a potential difference of
0.15 V when a 1000 Q resistor is substituted. What are the (a) inter-
nal resistance and (b) emf of the solar cell? (c) The area of the cell is
5.0 cm’, and the rate per unit area at which it receives energy from
light is 2.0 mW/cm?. What is the efficiency of the cell for converting
light energy to thermal energy in the 1000 © external resistor?

**°17 SSM In Fig. 27-33, battery 1 has emf
‘€, = 12.0V and internal resistance r, =
0.016 © and battery 2 has emf €, = 12.0 V
and internal resistance r) = 0.012 ©. The
batteries are connected in series with an ex-
ternal resistance R. (a) What R value makes
the terminal-to-terminal potential differ-
ence of one of the batteries zero? (b) Which
battery is that?

°18 In Fig. 27-9, what is the potential difference V; — V, between
points d and c if €; = 4.0 V, € = 1.0 V, Ri = Ry = 10 Q, and R; =
5.0 0, and the battery is ideal?

*19 A total resistance of 3.00 is to be produced by connecting
an unknown resistance to a 12.0 © resistance. (a) What must be the
value of the unknown resistance, and (b) should it be connected in
series or in parallel?

°20 When resistors 1 and 2 are connected in series, the equivalent
resistance is 16.0 ©. When they are connected in parallel, the
equivalent resistance is 3.0 0. What are (a) the smaller resistance
and (b) the larger resistance of these two resistors?

 

°21 Four 18.0 resistors are con-
nected in parallel across a 25.0V
ideal battery. What is the current
through the battery?

°22 Figure 27-34 shows five 5.00 0
resistors. Find the equivalent resis-
tance between points (a) F and H and
(b) F and G. (Hint: For each pair of
points, imagine that a battery is con-
nected across the pair.)

°23 In Fig. 27-35, R,; = 100 0, Ro =
50 Q, and the ideal batteries have
emfs €,=60V, €,=5.0V, and
‘€; = 4.0 V. Find (a) the current in re-
sistor 1, (b) the current in resistor 2,
and (c) the potential difference be-
tween points a and b.

and R; = 2.50 . Find the equivalent
resistance between points D and E.
(Hint: Imagine that a battery is con-
nected across those points.)

 

+25 SSM Nine copper wires of length
and diameter d are connected in par-
allel to form a single composite con-
ductor of resistance R. What must be:
the diameter D of a single copper wire
of length / if it is to have the same re-
sistance?

indicates one reason no one should |
stand under a tree during a lightning h
storm. If lightning comes down the |
side of the tree, a portion can jump
over to the person, especially if the
current on the tree reaches a dry re-
gion on the bark and thereafter must
travel through air to reach the
ground. In the figure, part of the lightning jumps through distance
d in air and then travels through the person (who has negligible
resistance relative to that of air because of the highly conducting
salty fluids within the body). The rest of the current travels through
air alongside the tree, for a distance h. If d/h = 0.400 and the total
current is J = 5000 A, what is the current through the person?
