39 @ In Fig. 27-50, two batteries with an
emf €=12.0V and an internal resistance
r = 0.300 © are connected in parallel across
a resistance R. (a) For what value of R is the
dissipation rate in the resistor a maximum?
(b) What is that maximum?

+40 © Two identical batteries of emf € =
12.0 V and internal resistance r = 0.200 © are
to be connected to an external resistance R,
either in parallel (Fig. 27-50) or in series

 

(Fig. 27-51). If R = 2.00r, what is the current i Figure 27-50

and 40.

and (b) series arrangements? (c) For which
arrangement is i greater? If R=
r/2.00, what is i in the external resist-
ance in the (d) parallel arrangement
and (e) series arrangement? (f) For
which arrangement is i greater now?

#41 In Fig. 27-41, €; = 3.00 V,€. =
1.00 V, Ry = 4.00 ©, Ry = 2.00.0, Rs =
5.00 ©, and both batteries are ideal.
What is the rate at which energy is dis-
sipated in (a) Rj, (b) Ry, and (c) R;? What is the power of (d) battery
1 and (e) battery 2?

42 In Fig. 27-52, an array of n par-
allel resistors is connected in series to
a resistor and an ideal battery. All the R
resistors have the same resistance. If
an identical resistor were added in
parallel to the parallel array, the cur-
rent through the battery would
change by 1.25%. What is the value
of n?

43 You are given a number of 10 1 resistors, each capable of
dissipating only 1.0 W without being destroyed. What is the mini-
mum number of such resistors that you need to combine in series
or in parallel to make a 10 © resist-
ance that is capable of dissipating at
least 5.0 W?

47 SSM A copper wire of radius a = 0.250 mm has an alu-
minum jacket of outer radius b = 0.380 mm. There is a current i =
2.00 A in the composite wire. Using Table 26-1, calculate the cur-
rent in (a) the copper and (b) the aluminum. (c) If a potential dif-
ference V = 12.0 V between the ends maintains the current, what
is the length of the composite wire?

48 @ In Fig, 27-53, the resistors have the values R, = 7.00 0,
R, = 12.0 Q, and R; = 4.00 Q, and the ideal battery’s emf is
‘€ = 24.0 V. For what value of Ry, will the rate at which the battery
transfers energy to the resistors equal (a) 60.0 W, (b) the maximum
possible rate P,,,,, and (c) the minimum possible rate Pin? What
are (d) Piyax and (€) Pyxin?

Module 27-3 The Ammeter and
the Voltmeter

49 ILW (a) In Fig. 27-56, what cur-
rent does the ammeter read if €
5.0 V (ideal battery), Ry = 2.0.9, Ry =
4.0 Q, and R; = 6.0 0? (b) The am-
meter and battery are now inter-
changed. Show that the ammeter
reading is unchanged.

50 In Fig. 27-57, R, = 2.00R, the
ammeter resistance is zero, and the
battery is ideal. What multiple of €/R he
gives the current in the ammeter?

51 In Fig. 27-58, a voltmeter of
resistance Ry = 300 © and an am-
meter of resistance Ra = 3.00 are
being used to measure a resistance
R ina circuit that also contains a re-
sistance Rp = 100 © and an ideal
battery with an emf of € = 12.0V.
Resistance R is given by R = Vii,
where V is the potential across R
and i is the ammeter reading. The
voltmeter reading is V’, which is
V plus the potential difference
across the ammeter. Thus, the ratio
of the two meter readings is not R but only an apparent resist-
ance R' = V'/i. If R = 85.0 ©, what are (a) the ammeter reading,
(b) the voltmeter reading, and (c) R'? (d) If Ra is decreased,
does the difference between R' and R increase, decrease, or
remain the same?
