reads from 0 to 1.00 mA, as shown in

Fig. 27-59. Resistance R is adjusted

so that when the clip leads are €}
shorted together, the meter deflects

to its full-scale value of 1.00 mA.
What external resistance across the
leads results in a deflection of (a)
10.0%, (b) 50.0%, and (c) 90.0% of full scale? (d) If the ammeter
has a resistance of 20.0 and the internal resistance of the battery
is negligible, what is the value of R?

°°53 In Fig. 27-14, assume that € = 3.0 V,r = 100 ©, R; = 250 Q,
and R; = 300 ©. If the voltmeter resistance Ry is 5.0 kQ, what per-
cent error does it introduce into the measurement of the potential
difference across R;? Ignore the presence of the ammeter.

°°54 When the lights of a car are
switched on, an ammeter in series with
them reads 10.0A and a_ voltmeter
connected across them reads 12.0 V (Fig.
27-60). When the electric starting motor is
turned on, the ammeter reading drops to
8.00 A and the lights dim somewhat. If the
internal resistance of the battery is 0.0500
© and that of the ammeter is negligible,
what are (a) the emf of the battery and (b)
the current through the starting motor
when the lights are on?

“55 In Fig. 27-61, R, is to be adjusted in
value by moving the sliding contact across
it until points a and b are brought to the
same potential. (One tests for this condition by momentarily con-
necting a sensitive ammeter be-
tween a and b; if these points are at
the same potential, the ammeter
will not deflect.) Show that when
this adjustment is made, the follow-
ing relation holds: R, = R,R,/Rj.
An unknown resistance (R,) can be
measured in terms of a standard
(R,) using this device, which is
called a Wheatstone bridge.

56 In Fig. 27-62, a voltmeter of
resistance Ry = 300 Q and an am-
meter of resistance Ra = 3.00 0
are being used to measure a resist-
ance R in a circuit that also con-
tains a resistance Ry = 100 © and
an ideal battery of emf € = 12.0 V.
Resistance R is given by R = Vii,
where V is the voltmeter reading
and / is the current in resistance R.
However, the ammeter reading is
not i but rather i’, which is i plus the
current through the voltmeter.
Thus, the ratio of the two meter
readings is not R but only an appar-
ent resistance R' = Vii’. If R = 85.0 ©, what are (a) the ammeter
reading, (b) the voltmeter reading, and (c) R'? (d) If Ry is in-
creased, does the difference between R' and R increase, decrease,
or remain the same?

a flashing lamp, like those attached to
barrels at highway construction sites.
The fluorescent lamp L (of negligible
capacitance) is connected in parallel
across the capacitor C of an RC circuit.
There is a current through the lamp
only when the potential difference
across it reaches the breakdown volt-
age V,; then the capacitor discharges completely through the lamp
and the lamp flashes briefly. For a lamp with breakdown voltage
V, = 72.0 V, wired to a 95.0 V ideal battery and a 0.150 jF capacitor,
what resistance R is needed for two flashes per second?
