ideal battery has emf @ = 20.0 V. First, the switch is closed a long
time so that the steady state is reached. Then the switch is opened
at time ¢ = 0. What is the current in resistor 2 at = 4.00 ms?

cuits with a charged capacitor that

is to be discharged through a resis-¢,

charges on the two capacitors is

qo2/qo1 = 1.50. At time t = 0, both switches are closed. At what
time t do the two capacitors have the same charge?

°°67 The potential difference between the plates of a leaky

capacitor drops to one-fourth its initial value in 2.0 s. What is the
equivalent resistance between the capacitor plates?

diameters of 2.60mm, are connected in series. A potential
difference of 60.0 V is applied between the ends of the composite

Figure 27-71 Problem 74.

75 <%= Suppose that, while you are sitting in a chair, charge
separation between your clothing and the chair puts you at a
potential of 200 V, with the capacitance between you and the
chair at 150 pF. When you stand up, the increased separation
between your body and the chair decreases the capacitance to
10 pF. (a) What then is the potential of your body? That poten-
tial is reduced over time, as the charge on you drains through
your body and shoes (you are a capacitor discharging through a
resistance). Assume that the resistance along that route is 300
GQ. If you touch an electrical component while your potential
is greater than 100 V, you could ruin the component. (b) How
long must you wait until your potential reaches the safe level of
100 V?

If you wear a conducting wrist strap that is connected to
ground, your potential does not increase as much when you stand
up; you also discharge more rapidly because the resistance through
the grounding connection is much less than through your body and
shoes. (c) Suppose that when you stand up, your potential is 1400 V
and the chair-to-you capacitance is 10 pF. What resistance in that
wrist-strap grounding connection will allow you to discharge to 100
Vin 0.30 s, which is less time than you would need to reach for, say,
your computer?
