77 ssM A temperature-stable resistor is made by connecting a
resistor made of silicon in series with one made of iron. If the re-
quired total resistance is 10009 in a wide temperature range
around 20°C, what should be the resistance of the (a) silicon resis-
tor and (b) iron resistor? (See Table 26-1.)

78 In Fig.27-14, assume that € = 5.0 V,r = 2.00, R, = 5.00, and
R, = 4.0 ©. If the ammeter resistance R, is 0.10 ©, what percent
error does it introduce into the measurement of the current?
Assume that the voltmeter is not present.

79 SSM An initially uncharged capacitor C is fully charged by a
device of constant emf @ connected in series with a resistor R.
(a) Show that the final energy stored in the capacitor is half the en-
ergy supplied by the emf device. (b) By direct integration of ?7R
over the charging time, show that the thermal energy dissipated by
the resistor is also half the energy supplied by the emf device.

83 SSM A controller on an electronic arcade game consists of
a variable resistor connected across the plates of a 0.220 uF capaci-
tor. The capacitor is charged to 5.00 V, then discharged through the
resistor. The time for the potential difference across the plates to
decrease to 0.800 V is measured by a
clock inside the game. If the range of
discharge times that can be handled
effectively is from 10.0 us to 6.00 ms,
what should be the (a) lower value
and (b) higher value of the resist-
ance range of the resistor?

unit is a float connected to a variable resistor whose resistance
varies linearly with the volume of gasoline. The resistance is 140
when the tank is empty and 20 © when the tank is full. Find the
current in the circuit when the tank is (a) empty, (b) half-full, and
(c) full. Treat the battery as ideal.

85 ssm The starting motor of a car is turning too slowly, and
the mechanic has to decide whether to replace the motor, the ca-
ble, or the battery. The car’s manual says that the 12 V battery
should have no more than 0.020 internal resistance, the motor no
more than 0.200 © resistance, and the cable no more than 0.040 0
resistance. The mechanic turns on the motor and measures 11.4 V
across the battery, 3.0 V across the cable, and a current of 50 A.
Which part is defective?

86 Two resistors R; and R, may be connected either in series or in
parallel across an ideal battery with emf €. We desire the rate of en-
ergy dissipation of the parallel combination to be five times that of
the series combination. If R; = 100 Q, what are the (a) smaller and
(b) larger of the two values of R; that result in that dissipation rate?

87 The circuit of Fig. 27-75 shows a
capacitor, two ideal batteries, two

been open for a long time. If it is then
closed for a long time, what is the
