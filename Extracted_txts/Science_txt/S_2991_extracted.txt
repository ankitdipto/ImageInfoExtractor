10 W by connecting the resistor to a battery whose emf is 1.5 V. (a)
What potential difference must exist across the resistor? (b) What
must be the internal resistance of the battery?

94 Figure 27-79 shows three 20.00 Cc
resistors. Find the equivalent resist-
ance between points (a) A and B, (b)

A and C, and (c) B and C. (Hint: 4
Imagine that a battery is connected
between a given pair of points.)

95 A 120V power line is protected by a 15 A fuse. What is the
maximum number of 500 W lamps that can be simultaneously op-
erated in parallel on this line without “blowing” the fuse because
of an excess of current?

96 Figure 27-63 shows an ideal battery of emf €=12V,
a resistor of resistance R = 4.0 Q, and an uncharged capacitor of
capacitance C = 4.0 uF. After switch S is closed, what is the current
through the resistor when the charge on the capacitor is 8.0 wC?
97 ssm A group of N identical batteries of emf € and internal re-
sistance r may be connected all in series (Fig. 27-80a) or all in par-
allel (Fig. 27-80b) and then across a resistor R. Show that both
arrangements give the same current in R if R =r.

104 A three-way 120 V lamp bulb that contains two filaments is
rated for 100-200-300 W. One filament burns out. Afterward, the
bulb operates at the same intensity (dissipates energy at the same
rate) on its lowest as on its highest switch positions but does not
operate at all on the middle position. (a) How are the two fila-
ments wired to the three switch positions? What are the (b) smaller
and (c) larger values of the filament resistances?
