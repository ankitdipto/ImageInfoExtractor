Figure 28-9 (a) A solid metal cube moves at constant velocity through a uniform magnetic field. (b)-(d) In these front views,
the magnetic force acting on an electron forces the electron to the left face, making that face negative and leaving the oppo-
site face positive. (e)-(f) The resulting weak electric field creates a weak electric force on the next electron, but it too is
forced to the left face. Now (g) the electric field is stronger and (h) the electric force matches the magnetic force.

(Fig. 28-9f). Because q is negative, this force is directed
opposite the field E—that is, rightward. Thus on each
electron, F, acts toward the right and Fy acts toward
the left.

2. When the cube had just begun to move through the mag-
netic field and the charge separation had just begun, the
magnitude of E began to increase from zero. Thus, the
magnitude of F;, also began to increase from zero and was
initially smaller than the magnitude of F;. During this
early stage, the net force on any electron was dominated
by F;, which continuously moved additional electrons to
the left cube face, increasing the charge separation be-
tween the left and right cube faces (Fig. 28-9g).

3. However, as the charge separation increased, eventually
magnitude F; became equal to magnitude Fg (Fig. 28-9h).
Because the forces were in opposite directions, the net
force on any electron was then zero, and no additional
electrons were moved to the left cube face. Thus, the
magnitude of F;, could not increase further, and the elec-
trons were then in equilibrium.

Calculations: We seek the potential difference V between
the left and right cube faces after equilibrium was reached
(which occurred quickly). We can obtain V with Eq. 28-9
(V = Ed) provided we first find the magnitude E of the
electric field at equilibrium. We can do so with the equation
for the balance of forces (Fz = F,).

For Fr, we substitute |q|E, and then for Fg, we substitute
|q|vB sin ¢ from Eq. 28-3. From Fig. 28-9a, we see that the
angle @ between velocity vector ¥ and magnetic field vector
Bis 90°; thus sin ¢ = Land F; = Fp yields

\qlE = |q|vB sin 90° = |q|vB.
This gives us E = vB;so V = Ed becomes
V = vBad.

Substituting known values tells us that the potential differ-
ence between the left and right cube faces is

V = (4.0 mvs)(0.050 T)(0.015 m)

= 0.0030 V = 3.0 mV. (Answer)
