Figure 28-10 Electrons circulating in a chamber containing gas at low pressure (their path

is the glowing circle). A uniform magnetic field B, pointing directly out of the plane of

the page, fills the chamber. Note the radially directed magnetic force Fy; for circular motion to
occur, Fi; must point toward the center of the circle. Use the right-hand rule for cross products to
confirm that F; = qv’ X B gives F; the proper direction. (Don’t forget the sign of q.)

 

 

we have
mv?
|q\vB = (28-15)
Solving for r,we find the radius of the circular path as
mv
r=—— (radius). (28-16)
\q\B

The period T (the time for one full revolution) is equal to the circumference
divided by the speed:

  

2ar 2a m 2am

T= — = — = pCi). (28-17

The frequency f (the number of revolutions per unit time) is

1 _ |q/B
== = (requency). 8-18
f T > 2am Uitequeney) (28-18)
The angular frequency w of the motion is then
B

wo = 2nf= ll (angular frequency). (28-19)

The quantities 7, f, and w do not depend on the speed of the particle (provided
the speed is much less than the speed of light). Fast particles move in large circles
and slow ones in small circles, but all particles with the same charge-to-mass ratio
|q\/m take the same time T (the period) to complete one round trip. Using Eq. 28-2,
you can show that if you are looking in the direction of B, the direction of ro-
tation for a positive particle is always counterclockwise, and the direction for
a negative particle is always clockwise.
