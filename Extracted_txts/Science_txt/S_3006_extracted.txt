Sample Problem 28.04 Uniform circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field

Figure 28-12 shows the essentials of a mass spectrometer,
which can be used to measure the mass of an ion; an ion of
mass m (to be measured) and charge q is produced in source
S. The initially stationary ion is accelerated by the electric
field due to a potential difference V.The ion leaves S and en-
ters a separator chamber in which a uniform magnetic field B
is perpendicular to the path of the ion. A wide detector lines
the bottom wall of the chamber, and the B causes the ion to
move in a semicircle and thus strike the detector. Suppose
that B = 80.000 mT, V = 1000.0 V, and ions of charge q =
+1.6022 x 10"! C strike the detector at a point that lies at
x = 1.6254 m. What is the mass m of the individual ions, in
atomic mass units (Eq. 1-7: 1 u = 1.6605 x 10°27 kg)?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) Because the (uniform) magnetic field causes the
(charged) ion to follow a circular path, we can relate the ion’s
mass m to the path’s radius r with Eq. 28-16 (r = mv/|q|B).
From Fig. 28-12 we see that r = x/2 (the radius is half the
diameter). From the problem statement, we know the magni-
tude B of the magnetic field. However, we lack the ion’s
speed v in the magnetic field after the ion has been acceler-
ated due to the potential difference V. (2) To relate v and V,
we use the fact that mechanical energy (Emec = K + U) is
conserved during the acceleration.

Finding speed: When the ion emerges from the source, its
kinetic energy is approximately zero. At the end of the
acceleration, its kinetic energy is yy. Also, during the ac-
celeration, the positive ion moves through a change in
potential of —V. Thus, because the ion has positive charge q,
its potential energy changes by —qV. If we now write the
conservation of mechanical energy as

AK + AU=0,

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

28.27 Describe how a cyclotron works, and in a sketch
indicate a particle's path and the regions where the kinetic
energy is increased.

28.28 Identify the resonance condition.

Key Ideas

28.29 For a cyclotron, apply the relationship between the par-
ticle’s mass and charge, the magnetic field, and the fre-
quency of circling.

28.30 Distinguish between a cyclotron and a synchrotron.

 

@ In a cyclotron, charged particles are accelerated by elec-
tric forces as they circle in a magnetic field.

@ Asynchrotron is needed for particles accelerated to nearly
the speed of light.
