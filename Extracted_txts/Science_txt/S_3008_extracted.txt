28-5 CYCLOTRONS AND SYNCHROTRONS

then “tune” the cyclotron by varying B until Eq. 28-24 is satisfied, and then many
protons circulate through the magnetic field, to emerge as a beam.

The Proton Synchrotron

At proton energies above 50 MeV, the conventional cyclotron begins to fail because
one of the assumptions of its design — that the frequency of revolution of a charged
particle circulating in a magnetic field is independent of the particle’s speed —is
true only for speeds that are much less than the speed of light. At greater proton
speeds (above about 10% of the speed of light), we must treat the problem relativis-
tically. According to relativity theory,as the speed of a circulating proton approaches
that of light, the proton’s frequency of revolution decreases steadily. Thus, the pro-
ton gets out of step with the cyclotron’s oscillator —whose frequency remains fixed
at fos-—and eventually the energy of the still circulating proton stops increasing.

There is another problem. For a 500 GeV proton in a magnetic field of 1.5 T,
the path radius is 1.1 km.The corresponding magnet for a conventional cyclotron
of the proper size would be impossibly expensive, the area of its pole faces being
about 4 x 10° m*.

The proton synchrotron is designed to meet these two difficulties. The mag-
netic field B and the oscillator frequency f,.., instead of having fixed values as
in the conventional cyclotron, are made to vary with time during the accelerat-
ing cycle. When this is done properly, (1) the frequency of the circulating pro-
tons remains in step with the oscillator at all times, and (2) the protons follow a
circular—not a spiral —path. Thus, the magnet need extend only along that cir-
cular path, not over some 4 x 10° m*. The circular path, however, still must be
large if high energies are to be achieved.

Sample Problem 28.05 Accelerating a charged particle in a cyclotron

Suppose a cyclotron is operated at an oscillator frequency of
12 MHzand has a dee radius R = 53 cm.

(a) What is the magnitude of the magnetic field needed for
deuterons to be accelerated in the cyclotron? The deuteron
mass is m = 3.34 X 10-7’ kg (twice the proton mass).

KEY IDEA

For a given oscillator frequency f,,., the magnetic field mag-
nitude B required to accelerate any particle in a cyclotron
depends on the ratio m/|q| of mass to charge for the particle,
according to Eq. 28-24 (|q|B = 2m7mfos-).

Calculation: For deuterons and the oscillator frequency f,.. =
12 MHz, we find
_ 2amfose __(277)(3.34 X 10-°7kg)(12 x 10°s)
lal 1.60 x 10°C
= 157T ~ 1.6T. (Answer)

Note that, to accelerate protons, B would have to be reduced
by a factor of 2, provided the oscillator frequency remained
fixed at 12 MHz.

(b) What is the resulting kinetic energy of the deuterons?

B

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The kinetic energy (mv?) of a deuteron exiting the
cyclotron is equal to the kinetic energy it had just before exit-
ing, when it was traveling in a circular path with a radius
approximately equal to the radius R of the cyclotron dees.
(2) We can find the speed v of the deuteron in that circular path
with Eq.28-16 (r = mvi/iq\B).

Calculations: Solving that equation for v, substituting R for
r,and then substituting known data, we find

_ RUB _ (0.53 m\(1.60 x 10-° C57 T)
em 3.34 X 1027 kg

= 3.99 x 10’ mis.
This speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of
K =3mv
= 5(3.34 X 10-27 kg)(3.99 x 107 m/s)?

or about 17 MeV.
