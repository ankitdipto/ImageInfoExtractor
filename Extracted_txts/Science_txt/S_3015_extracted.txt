Moments net as a magnetic dipole. However, a rotating sphere of charge is also a magnetic

Language. Some instructors refer to U in Eq. 28-38 as a potential energy and
relate it to work done by the magnetic field when the orientation of the dipole
changes. Here we shall avoid the debate and say that U is an energy associated
with the dipole orientation.

the dipole and (b) the orientation energy of the dipole, greatest first.
