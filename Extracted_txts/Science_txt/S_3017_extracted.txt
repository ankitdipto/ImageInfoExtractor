828 CHAPTER 28 MAGNETIC FIELDS

5 In Module 28-2, we discussed a_charged particle moving
through crossed fields with the forces F; and Fy in opposition. We
found that the particle moves in a straight line (that is, neither
force dominates the motion) if its speed is given by Eq. 28-7 (v =
E/B). Which of the two forces dominates if the speed of the parti-
cle is (a) v < E/Band (b) v > E/B?

6 Figure 28-26 shows crossed uniform electric and magnetic
fields E and B and, at a certain instant, the velocity vectors of the
10 charged particles listed in Table 28-3. (The vectors are not
drawn to scale.) The speeds given in the table are either less than
or greater than E/B (see Question 5). Which particles will move
out of the page toward you after the instant shown in Fig. 28-26?

7 Figure 28-27 shows the path of an
electron that passes through two regions
containing uniform magnetic fields of
magnitudes B, and By. Its path in each
region is a half-circle. (a) Which field is
stronger? (b) What is the direction of
each field? (c) Is the time spent by the
electron in the B, region greater than,
less than, or the same as the time spent
in the By region?

8 Figure 28-28 shows the path of

an electron in a region of uniform
magnetic field. The path consists of

two straight sections, each between

a pair of uniformly charged plates,
and two half-circles. Which plate is

at the higher electric potential in (a)

the top pair of plates and (b) the
bottom pair? (c) What is the direction of the magnetic field?

9 (a) InCheckpoint 5, if the dipole moment {7 is rotated from ori-
entation 2 to orientation 1 by an external agent, is the work done
on the dipole by the agent positive, negative, or zero? (b) Rank the
work done on the dipole by the agent for these three rotations,
greatest first: 2 > 1,2 > 4,23.

 

10 Particle roundabout. Figure 28-29 shows 11 paths through a
region of uniform magnetic field. One path is a straight line; the
rest are half-circles, Table 28-4 gives the masses, charges, and
speeds of 11 particles that take these paths through the field in the
directions shown. Which path in the figure corresponds to which

 

particle in the table? (The direction of the magnetic field can be
determined by means of one of the paths, which is unique.)

11 In Fig. 28-30, a charged particle

enters a uniform magnetic field B =
with speed vp, moves through a half-
circle in time 7), and then leaves the
field. (a) Is the charge positive or
negative? (b) Is the final speed of
the particle greater than, less than,
or equal to vy? (c) If the initial speed
had been 0.59, would the time spent in field B have been greater
than, less than, or equal to Ty? (d) Would the path have been a
half-circle, more than a half-circle, or less than a half-circle?

12 Figure 28-31 gives snapshots for three situations in which a
positively charged particle passes through a uniform magnetic field
B.The velocities ¥ of the particle differ in orientation in the three
snapshots but not in magnitude. Rank the situations according to
(a) the period, (b) the frequency, and (c) the pitch of the particle’s
motion, greatest first.
