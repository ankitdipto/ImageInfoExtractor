Module 28-1 Magnetic Fields and the Definition of B

*1 ssmM_ ttw A proton traveling at 23.0° with respect to the di-
rection of a magnetic field of strength 2.60 mT experiences a mag-
netic force of 6.50 X 10-!7N. Calculate (a) the proton’s speed and
(b) its kinetic energy in electron-volts.

*2 A particle of mass 10g and charge 80 uC moves through a
uniform magnetic field, in a region where the free-fall acceleration
is —9.8] m/s’. The velocity of the particle is a constant 20i km/s,
which is perpendicular to the magnetic field. What, then, is the
magnetic field?

°3  Anelectron that has an instantaneous velocity of
¥ = (2.0 X 10° m/s)i + (3.0 X 10° mis)j

is moving through the uniform magnetic field B = (0.030 T)i —
(0.15 T)j. (a) Find the force on the electron due to the magnetic
field. (b) Repeat your calculation for a proton having the same
velocity.

°4 Analpha particle travels at a velocity 7 of magnitude 550 m/s
through a uniform magnetic field B of magnitude 0.045 T. (An al-
pha particle has a charge of +3.2 x 10-"’ C and a mass of 6.6 X
10-’ kg.) The angle between v and B is 52°. What is the magni-
tude of (a) the force Fy acting on the particle due to the field and
(b) the acceleration of the particle due to Fy? (c) Does the speed
of the particle increase, decrease, or remain the same?

byB= Bit Gs OB}. Ata particular instant, the electron has ve-
locity ¥ = (2.01 + 4. 0}) m/s and the magnetic force acting on it is
(6.4 X 10-" N)k. Find B,.

given by = vi + yj + (2.0 km/s)k and the magnetic force on
the proton is Fy = (4.0 X 10-7 N)i + (2.0 X 10°" N)j. At that
instant, what are (a) v, and (b) vy?

°7 Anelectron has an initial velocity of (12.0) + 15.0k) km/s and
a constant acceleration of (2.00 X 10! m/s?)i in a region in which
uniform electric and magnetic fields are present. If B = (400 wT)i,
find the electric field E.

field of 0.400 T act on a moving electron to produce no net force.

V = 100 V. The lower plate is at the lower potential. Neglect fring-
ing and assume that the electron’s velocity vector is perpendicular
to the electric field vector between the plates. In unit-vector nota-
tion, what uniform magnetic field allows the electron to travel ina
straight line in the gap?

*10 A proton travels through uniform magnetic and electric
fields. The magnetic field is B= 50i mT. At one instant the
velocity of the proton is ¥ = 2000) m/s. At that instant and in
unit-vector notation, what is the net force acting on the proton
if the electric field is (a) 4.00k Vim, (b) —4.00k Vim, and
(c) 4.001 Vim?

#11 © Anion source is producing “Li ions, which have charge +e
and mass 9.99 X 10-’ kg, The ions are accelerated by a potential
difference of 10 kV and pass horizontally into a region in which
there is a uniform vertical magnetic field of magnitude B = 1.2 T.
Calculate the strength of the smallest electric field, to be set up
over the same region, that will allow the °Li ions to pass through
undeflected.

 

 

12 © At time 4, an electron is
sent along the positive direction of
an x axis, through both an electric
field E and a magnetic field B, with
E directed parallel to the y axis.
Figure 28-33 gives the y component
Fyety of the net force on the electron
due to the two fields, as a function of
the electron’s speed v at time f;. The
scale of the velocity axis is set by
v, = 100.0 mvs. The x and z compo-
nents of the net force are zero at fy.
Assuming B, = 0, find (a) the magni-
tude E and (b) B in unit-vector notation.

Module 28-3 Crossed Fields: The Hall Effect

13 A strip of copper 150 wm thick and 4.5 mm wide is placed in
a uniform magnetic field B of magnitude 0.65 T, with B perpendi-
cular to the strip. A current i = 23 A is then sent through the strip
such that a Hall potential difference V appears across the width of
the strip. Calculate V. (The number of charge carriers per unit vol-
ume for copper is 8.47 X 10° electrons/m*.)
