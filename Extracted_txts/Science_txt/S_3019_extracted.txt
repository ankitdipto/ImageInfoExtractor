B = (30.0mT)j (Fig, 28-35). What are the resulting (a) electric
field within the solid, in unit-vector notation, and (b) potential dif-
ference across the solid?

16 @ Figure 28-35 shows a metal-
lic block, with its faces parallel to
coordinate axes. The block is in a uni-
form magnetic field of magnitude
0.020 T. One edge length of the block
is 25 cm; the block is not drawn to
scale. The block is moved at 3.0 m/s
parallel to each axis, in turn, and the
resulting potential difference V that
appears across the block is meas-
ured. With the motion parallel to the
y axis, V = 12 mV; with the motion parallel to the z axis, V = 18
mV; with the motion parallel to the x axis, V = 0. What are the
block lengths (a) d,,(b) d,,and (c) d.?

Module 28-4 A Circulating Charged Particle

17 An alpha particle can be produced in certain radioactive
decays of nuclei and consists of two protons and two neutrons. The
particle has a charge of q = +2e and a mass of 4.00 u, where u is
the atomic mass unit, with 1 u = 1.661 x 10-7’ kg. Suppose an al-
pha particle travels ina circular path of radius 4.50 cm in a uniform
magnetic field with B = 1.20T. Calculate (a) its speed, (b) its
period of revolution, (c) its kinetic energy, and (d) the potential
difference through which it would have to be accelerated to
achieve this energy.

27 A mass spectrometer (Fig. 28-12) is used to separate ura-
nium ions of mass 3.92 X 10-5 kg and charge 3.20 X 10-"° C from
related species. The ions are accelerated through a potential differ-
ence of 100 kV and then pass into a uniform magnetic field, where
they are bent in a path of radius 1.00 m. After traveling through
180° and passing through a slit of width 1.00mm and height
