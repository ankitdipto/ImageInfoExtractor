What is the electron’s speed?

30 @ In Fig. 28-40, an electron with an
initial kinetic energy of 4.0 keV enters re-
gion 1 at time ¢ = 0. That region contains a
uniform magnetic field directed into the
page, with magnitude 0.010 T. The electron
goes through a half-circle and then exits
region 1, headed toward region 2 across a
gap of 25.0 cm. There is an electric poten-
tial difference AV = 2000 V across the
gap, with a polarity such that the electron’s
speed increases uniformly as it traverses
the gap. Region 2 contains a uniform magnetic field directed out of
the page, with magnitude 0.020 T. The electron goes through a half-
circle and then leaves region 2. At what time t does it leave?
