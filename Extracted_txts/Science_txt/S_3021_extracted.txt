832 CHAPTER 28 MAGNETIC FIELDS

46 In Fig. 28-44, a metal wire of mass m = 24.1 mg can slide
with negligible friction on two horizontal parallel rails separated
by distance d = 2.56 cm. The track lies in a vertical uniform mag-
netic field of magnitude 56.3 mT. At time t= 0, device G is con-
nected to the rails, producing a constant current i = 9.13 mA in the
wire and rails (even as the wire moves). At tf = 61.1 ms, what are
the wire’s (a) speed and (b) direction of motion (left or right)?

°47 @ A 1.0kg copper rod rests on two horizontal rails
1.0 m apart and carries a current of 50 A from one rail to the other.
The coefficient of static friction between rod and rails is 0.60. What
are the (a) magnitude and (b) angle (relative to the vertical) of the
smallest magnetic field that puts the rod on the verge of sliding?

+48 @ A long, rigid conductor, lying along an x axis, carries a
current of 5.0A in the negative x direction. A magnetic field
B is present, given by B = 3.01 + 8.0x°j, with x in meters and B in
milliteslas. Find, in unit-vector notation, the force on the 2.0 m seg-
ment of the conductor that lies between x = 1.0m and x = 3.0m.

Module 28-7 Torque on a Current Loop
°49 ssM Figure 28-45 shows a rec-
tangular 20-turn coil of wire, of di-
mensions 10 cm by 5.0 cm. It carries
a current of 0.10 A and is hinged
along one long side. It is mounted in
the xy plane, at angle @ = 30° to the
direction of a uniform magnetic field
of magnitude 0.50 T. In unit-vector
notation, what is the torque acting
on the coil about the hinge line?

 

°50 An electron moves ina circle
of radius r =5.29 X 10-"'m with
speed 2.19 X 10° m/s. Treat the circular path as a current loop
with a constant current equal to the ratio of the electron’s charge
magnitude to the period of the motion. If the circle lies in a uni-
form magnetic field of magnitude B = 7.10 mT, what is the maxi-
mum possible magnitude of the torque produced on the loop by
the field?

51 Figure 28-46 shows a wood cylinder of mass m = 0.250 kg
and length L =0.100m, with N= 10.0 turns of wire wrapped
around it longitudinally, so that the
plane of the wire coil contains the
long central axis of the cylinder. The
cylinder is released on a plane in-
clined at an angle @ to the horizontal,
with the plane of the coil parallel to
the incline plane. If there is a vertical
uniform magnetic field of magnitude
0.500 T, what is the least current i
through the coil that keeps the cylin-
der from rolling down the plane?

52 In Fig, 28-47, a rectangular loop car-
rying current lies in the plane of a uniform
magnetic field of magnitude 0.040 T. The

ducting wire that is wrapped around a flexi-

is varied from approximately zero to its

maximum value of approximately 4.0cm, the magnitude 7 of
the torque on the loop changes. The maximum value of ris 4.80 x
10-8 N-m. What is the current in the loop?

°°53 Prove that the relation 7 = NiAB sin @ holds not only for the
rectangular loop of Fig. 28-19 but also for a closed loop of any
shape. (Hint: Replace the loop of arbitrary shape with an assembly
of adjacent long, thin, approximately rectangular loops that are
nearly equivalent to the loop of arbitrary shape as far as the distri-
bution of current is concerned.)

Module 28-8 The Magnetic Dipole Moment

54 A magnetic dipole with a dipole moment of magnitude
0.020 J/T is released from rest in a uniform magnetic field of mag-
nitude 52 mT. The rotation of the dipole due to the magnetic force
on it is unimpeded. When the dipole rotates through the orienta-
tion where its dipole moment is aligned with the magnetic field, its
kinetic energy is 0.80 mJ. (a) What is the initial angle between the
dipole moment and the magnetic field? (b) What is the angle
when the dipole is next (momentarily) at rest?

*55 ssM Two concentric, circular y
wire loops, of radii r; = 20.0 cm and

7) = 30.0 cm, are located in an xy

plane; each carries a clockwise cur-

rent of 7.00 A (Fig. 28-48). (a) Find

the magnitude of the net magnetic re
dipole moment of the system.

15.0 cm carries a current of 2.60 A.
It is placed so that the normal to its
plane makes an angle of 41.0° with a
uniform magnetic field of magni-
tude 12.0 T. (a) Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic dipole
moment of the loop. (b) What is the magnitude of the torque acting
on the loop?

(a) Calculate the current that results in a magnetic dipole moment
of magnitude 2.30 A-m_. (b) Find the maximum magnitude of the
torque that the coil, carrying this current, can experience in a uni-
form 35.0 mT magnetic field.

°58 The magnetic dipole moment of Earth has magnitude 8.00 x
10°? J/T. Assume that this is produced by charges flowing in Earth’s
molten outer core. If the radius of their circular path is 3500 km,
calculate the current they produce.

59 A current loop, carrying a current of 5.0 A, is in the shape of
aright triangle with sides 30,40, and 50 cm. The loop is in a uniform
magnetic field of magnitude 80 mT whose direction is parallel to
the current in the 50 cm side of the loop. Find the magnitude of
(a) the magnetic dipole moment of the loop and (b) the torque on
the loop.
