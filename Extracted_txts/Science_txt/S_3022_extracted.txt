to the coordinate axes shown, with
AB = 20.0 cm, BC = 30.0 cm, and FA =
10.0 cm. In unit-vector notation, what is
the magnetic dipole moment of this
loop? (Hint: Imagine equal and oppo-
site currents i in the line segment AD;
then treat the two rectangular loops
ABCDA and ADEFA.)

current i = 2.00 A in the direction indicated, is parallel to an xz
plane, has 3.00 turns and an area of 4.00 x 10 m?, and lies in a
uniform magnetic field B = (2.001 — 3.00 — 4.00k) mT. What

62 ® In Fig. 28-51a, two concentric coils, lying in the same
plane, carry currents in opposite directions. The current in the
larger coil 1 is fixed. Current i, in coil 2 can be varied. Figure 28-51
gives the net magnetic moment of the two-coil system as a function
of is. The vertical axis scale is set by Ay, = 2.0 X 10-5 A-m?, and
the horizontal axis scale is set by :, = 10.0 mA. If the current in
coil 2 is then reversed, what is the magnitude of the net magnetic
moment of the two-coil system when i, = 7.0 mA?

current of 0.20 A.A vector of unit length and parallel to the dipole
moment £ of the loop is given by 0.601 — 0.80). (This unit vector
gives the orientation of the magnetic dipole moment vector.) If the
loop is located in a uniform magnetic field given by B=

tor notation) and (b) the orientation energy of the loop.

about an axle with negligible friction in order to change ¢.
