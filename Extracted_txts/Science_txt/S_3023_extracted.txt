834 CHAPTER 28 MAGNETIC FIELDS

72 A beam of electrons whose
kinetic energy is K emerges from a
thin-foil “window” at the end of an
accelerator tube. A metal plate at dis-
tance d from this window is perpendi-
cular to the direction of the emerging
beam (Fig, 28-53). (a) Show that we
can prevent the beam from hitting
the plate if we apply a uniform mag-

netic field such that

in which m and e are the electron mass and charge. (b) How should
B be oriented?

73 SSM At time ¢=0, an electron with kinetic energy 12 keV
moves through x = 0 in the positive direction of an x axis that is
parallel to the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field B.
The field’s vertical component is downward and has magnitude
55.0 wT. (a) What is the magnitude of the electron’s acceleration
due to B? (b) What is the electron’s distance from the x axis when
the electron reaches coordinate x = 20 cm?

74 ® A particle with charge 2.0 C moves through a uniform mag-
netic field. At one instant the velocity of the particle is
(2.01 + 4.0} + 6.0k) m/s and the magnetic force on the particle is
(4.01 — 20} + 12k) N. The x and y components of the magnetic
field are equal. What is B?

75 A proton,a deuteron (q = +e,m = 2.0 u), and an alpha parti-
cle (q = +2e, m = 4.0 u) all having the same kinetic energy enter a
region of uniform magnetic field B, moving perpendicular to B.
What is the ratio of (a) the radius r, of the deuteron path to the ra-
dius r, of the proton path and (b) the radius r, of the alpha particle
path tor,?

76 Bainbridge’s mass spectrometer,
shown in Fig. 28-54, separates ions
having the same velocity. The ions, af-
ter entering through slits, S, and S),
pass through a velocity selector com-
posed of an electric field produced by
the charged plates P and P’, and a
magnetic field B perpendicular to the
electric field and the ion path. The
ions that then pass undeviated
through the crossed E and B fields
enter into a region where a second
magnetic field B' exists, where they are made to follow circular
paths. A photographic plate (or a modern detector) registers their
arrival. Show that, for the ions, g/m = E/rBB', where r is the radius

of the circular orbit.

moves at speed v = 100 m/s along an
x axis through uniform electric and
magnetic fields. The magnetic field B
is directed into the page and has
magnitude 5.00 T. In unit-vector no-
tation, what is the electric field?

78 (a) In Fig. 28-8, show that the ratio of the Hall electric field
magnitude E to the magnitude Ec of the electric field
responsible for moving charge (the current) along the length of

 

the strip is

where p is the resistivity of the material and n is the number den-

sity of the charge carriers. (b) Compute this ratio numerically for
Problem 13. (See Table 26-1.)

79 SSM A proton, a deuteron (q = +e, m = 2.0 u), and an alpha
particle (q = +2e, m = 4.0u) are accelerated through the same
potential difference and then enter the same region of uniform
magnetic field B, moving perpendicular to B. What is the ratio
of (a) the proton’s kinetic energy K, to the alpha particle’s kinetic
energy K, and (b) the deuteron’s Kinetic energy K, to K,? If the
radius of the proton’s circular path is 10 cm, what is the radius of
(c) the deuteron’s path and (d) the alpha particle’s path?

80 Anelectron is moving at 7.20 X 10° m/s in a magnetic field of
strength 83.0 mT. What is the (a) maximum and (b) minimum
magnitude of the force acting on the electron due to the field?
(c) At one point the electron has an acceleration of magnitude
4.90 X 10'4 m/s”. What is the angle between the electron’s velocity
and the magnetic field?

81 A5.0 uC particle moves through a region containing the uni-
form magnetic field —20imT and the uniform electric field
300] V/m. At a certain instant the velocity of the particle is
(171 — 11) + 7.0k) km/s. At that instant and in unit-vector nota-
tion, what is the net electromagnetic force (the sum of the electric
and magnetic forces) on the particle?

82 In a Hall-effect experiment, a current of 3.0 A sent length-
wise through a conductor 1.0 cm wide, 4.0.cm long, and 10 um
thick produces a transverse (across the width) Hall potential dif-
ference of 10 “V when a magnetic field of 1.5 T is passed perpen-
dicularly through the thickness of the conductor. From these
data, find (a) the drift velocity of the charge carriers and (b) the
number density of charge carriers. (c) Show on a diagram the po-
larity of the Hall potential difference with assumed current and
magnetic field directions, assuming also that the charge carriers
are electrons.

83 ssM A particle of mass 6.0 g moves at 4.0 km/s in an xy plane,
in a region with a uniform magnetic field given by 5.01 mT. At one
instant, when the particle’s velocity is directed 37° counterclock-
wise from the positive direction of the x axis, the magnetic force on
the particle is 0.48k N. What is the particle’s charge?

84 A wire lying along an x axis from x=0 to x= 100m
carries a current of 3.00 A in the positive x direction. The wire is
immersed in a nonuniform magnetic field that is given by B =
(4.00 T/m2)x’i — (0.600 T/m2)x?j. In unit-vector notation, what is
the magnetic force on the wire?

85 At one instant, 7 = (—2.00i + 4.00) — 6.0K) m/s is the ve-
locity of a proton in a uniform magnetic field B = (2.001 —
4.00} + 8.00k) mT. At that instant, what are (a) the magnetic force
F acting on the proton, in unit-vector notation, (b) the angle
between 7 and F, and (c) the angle between i” and B?

86 An electron has velocity ¥ = (321 + 40j) km/s as it enters a
uniform magnetic field B= 60 “eT. What are (a) the radius of the
helical path taken by the electron and (b) the pitch of that path?
(c) To an observer looking into the magnetic field region from the
entrance point of the electron, does the electron spiral clockwise or
counterclockwise as it moves?
