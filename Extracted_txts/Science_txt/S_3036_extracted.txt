29-3 AMPERE’S LAW 847

Sample Problem 29.03 Ampere’s law to find the field inside a long cylinder of current

Figure 29-16a shows the cross section of a long conducting
cylinder with inner radius a=2.0cm and outer radius
b = 4.0 cm. The cylinder carries a current out of the page, and
the magnitude of the current density in the cross section is
given by J = cr’, with c = 3.0 x 10° A/m* and r in meters.
What is the magnetic field B at the dot in Fig, 29-16a, which is
at radius r = 3.0 cm from the central axis of the cylinder?

KEY IDEAS

 

The point at which we want to evaluate Bis inside the mate-
rial of the conducting cylinder, between its inner and outer
radii. We note that the current distribution has cylindrical
symmetry (it is the same all around the cross section for any
given radius). Thus, the symmetry allows us to use Ampere’s
law to find B at the point. We first draw the Amperian loop
shown in Fig. 29-16. The loop is concentric with the cylin-
der and has radius r = 3.0 cm because we want to evaluate
B at that distance from the cylinder’s central axis.

We want the
magnetic field at
the dot at radius r.

So, we put a concentric
Amperian loop through
the dot.

Its area dA is the
product of the ring’s
circumference

and the width dr.

The current within the
ring is the product of
the current density J
and the ring’s area dA.

Next, we must compute the current i,,, that is encircled
by the Amperian loop. However, we cannot set up a propor-
tionality as in Eq. 29-19, because here the current is not uni-
formly distributed. Instead, we must integrate the current
density magnitude from the cylinder’s inner radius a to the
loop radius r, using the steps shown in Figs. 29-16c through h.

Calculations: We write the integral as

Note that in these steps we took the differential area dA to
be the area of the thin ring in Figs 29-16d-f and then

 

We start with a ring @ X

that is so thin that

we can approximate
the current density as
being uniform within it.

We need to find the
current in the area
encircled by the loop.

Our job is to sum
the currents in all
rings from this
smallest one ...

... to this largest
one, which has the
same radius as the
Amperian loop.

Figure 29-16 (a)-(b) To find the magnetic field at a point within this conducting cylinder, we use a concentric Amperian
loop through the point. We then need the current encircled by the loop. (c)-(h) Because the current density is nonuni-
form, we start with a thin ring and then sum (via integration) the currents in all such rings in the encircled area.
