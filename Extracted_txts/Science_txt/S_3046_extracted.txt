magnitude of the magnetic field at P, due to i?

14 Equation 29-4 gives the magnitude B of the magnetic field
set up by acurrent in an infinitely long straight wire, at a point P
at perpendicular distance R from the wire. Suppose that point P
is actually at perpendicular distance R from the midpoint of a
wire with a finite length L. Using Eq. 29-4 to calculate B then re-
sults in a certain percentage error. What value must the ratio
LIR exceed if the percentage error is to be less than 1.00%? That
is, what L/R gives

18 A current is set up in a wire
loop consisting of a semicircle of ra-
dius 4.00 cm, a smaller concentric
semicircle, and two radial straight
lengths, all in the same plane. Figure
29-47a shows the arrangement but is
not drawn to scale. The magnitude
of the magnetic field produced at
the center of curvature is 47.25 wT. The smaller semicircle is then
flipped over (rotated) until the loop is again entirely in the same
plane (Fig. 29-47b). The magnetic field produced at the (same) cen-
ter of curvature now has magnitude 15.75 wT, and its direction is
reversed from the initial magnetic field. What is the radius of the
smaller semicircle?

19 One long wire lies along an x axis and carries a current of 30
A in the positive x direction. A second long wire is perpendicular to
the xy plane, passes through the point (0, 4.0 m, 0), and carries a cur-
rent of 40 A in the positive z direction. What is the magnitude of the
resulting magnetic field at the point (0,2.0 m, 0)?
