20 In Fig. 29-48, part of a long in-
sulated wire carrying current
i=5.78 mA is bent into a circular
section of radius R=1.89cm. In
unit-vector notation, what is the
magnetic field at the center of curva-
ture C if the circular section (a) lies
in the plane of the page as shown
and (b) is perpendicular to the plane
of the page after being rotated 90°
counterclockwise as indicated?

+21 @ Figure 29-49 shows two
very long straight wires (in cross sec-
tion) that each carry a current of
4.00A directly out of the page.
Distance d; = 6.00m and distance
d, = 4.00 m. What is the magnitude
of the net magnetic field at point P,
which lies on a perpendicular bisec-
tor to the wires?

22 @ Figure 29-50a shows, in cross section, two long, parallel
wires carrying current and separated by distance L. The ratio i,/i,
of their currents is 4.00; the directions of the currents are not indi-
cated. Figure 29-50b shows the y component B, of their net mag-
netic field along the x axis to the right of wire 2. The vertical scale is
set by B,, = 4.0 nT, and the horizontal scale is set by x, = 20.0 cm.
(a) At what value of x > 0 is B, maximum? (b) If i; = 3 mA, what is
the value of that maximum? What is the direction (into or out of the
page) of (c) i and (d)i;?

23 ILW Figure 29-51 shows a snap-
shot of a proton moving at velocity
¥ = (—200 m/s)j toward a long straight
wire with current i= 350mA. At the
instant shown, the proton’s distance
from the wire is d = 2.89 cm. In unit-
vector notation, what is the magnetic

force on the proton due to the current?

+24 @ Figure 29-52 shows, in cross
section, four thin wires that are paral-
lel, straight, and very long, They carry
identical currents in the directions in-
dicated. Initially all four wires are at
distance d = 15.0cm from the origin
of the coordinate system, where they
create a net magnetic field B. (a) To
what value of x must you move wire 1
along the x axis in order to rotate B
counterclockwise by 30°? (b) With wire
1 in that new position, to what value of x

must you move wire 3 along the x axis to rotate B by 30° back to its
initial orientation?

25 ssm A wire with current
i= 3.00 A is shown in Fig. 29-53. Two (\Sp)

semi-infinite straight sections, both tan-
gent to the same circle, are connected :

sections all lie in the same plane. If B =
Oat the circle’s center, what is 6?

26 @_ In Fig. 29-54a, wire 1 consists of a circular are and two
radial lengths; it carries current i;=0.50A in the direction
indicated. Wire 2, shown in cross section, is long, straight, and per-
pendicular to the plane of the figure. Its distance from the center of
the arc is equal to the radius R of the arc, and it carries a current i,
that can be varied. The two currents set up a net magnetic field B at
the center of the arc. Figure 29-54b gives the square of the field’s
magnitude B? plotted versus the square of the current i3. The verti-
cal scale is set by B? = 10.0 x 10-!°T?. What angle is subtended by
the arc?

They are equal distances from the
