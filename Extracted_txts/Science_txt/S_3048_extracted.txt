direction indicated. Wire 2 is long and straight; it carries a current iz
that can be varied; and it is at distance R/2 from the center of the
arc. The net magnetic field B due to the two currents is measured
at the center of curvature of the arc. Figure 29-56b is a plot of
the component of B in the direction perpendicular to the figure as
a function of current i). The horizontal scale is set by ij, = 1.00 A.
What is the angle subtended by the arc?

**29 SSM In Fig. 29-57, four long straight wires are perpendicular
to the page, and their cross sections form a square of edge length
a = 20 cm. The currents are out of the page in wires 1 and 4 and
into the page in wires 2 and 3, and each wire carries 20 A. In
unit-vector notation, what is the net magnetic field at the
square’s center?

30 @® ~ Two long straight thin wires with current lie against an
equally long plastic cylinder, at radius R = 20.0 cm from the cylin-
der’s central axis. Figure 29-58a shows, in cross section, the cylinder
and wire 1 but not wire 2. With wire 2 fixed in place, wire 1 is moved
around the cylinder, from angle 6, = 0° to angle 6, = 180°, through
the first and second quadrants of the xy coordinate system. The net
magnetic field B at the center of the cylinder is measured as a
function of 6. Figure 29-58b gives the x component B, of that field
asa function of 6; (the vertical scale is set by B,, = 6.0 wT), and Fig.
29-58c gives the y component B, (the vertical scale is set by B,, = 4.0
zu). (a) At what angle 0, is wire 2 located? What are the (b) size and
(c) direction (into or out of the page) of the current in wire 1 and the
(d) size and (e) direction of the current in wire 2?

32 @® The current-carrying wire
loop in Fig. 29-60 lies all in one plane
and consists of a semicircle of radius 10.0
cm, a smaller semicircle with the same
center, and two radial lengths. The
smaller semicircle is rotated out of that
plane by angle 0, until it is perpendicular
to the plane (Fig. 29-606). Figure 29-60c gives the magnitude of the
net magnetic field at the center of curvature versus angle @. The
vertical scale is set by B, = 10.0 #T and B, = 12.0 wT. What is
the radius of the smaller semicircle?

°33 SSM ILW Figure 29-61 shows

a cross section of a long thin ribbon

of width w = 4.91 cm that is carrying x
a uniformly distributed total current
i= 4.61 pA into the page. In unit-vec-
tor notation, what is the magnetic
field B at a point P in the plane of the
ribbon at a distance d = 2.16 cm from
its edge? (Hint: Imagine the ribbon as
being constructed from many long, d
thin, parallel wires.)

34 @ Figure 29-62 shows, in
cross section, two long straight wires
held against a plastic cylinder of ra-
dius 20.0cm. Wire 1 carries current
i, = 60.0 mA out of the page and is
fixed in place at the left side of the
cylinder. Wire 2 carries current i, =
40.0 mA out of the page and can be
moved around the cylinder. At what
(positive) angle @ should wire 2 be

positioned such that, at the origin,

the net magnetic field due to the two

currents has magnitude 80.0 nT?
