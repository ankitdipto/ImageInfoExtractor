carrying wires that are long, straight, and parallel to one another.
Wires 1 and 2 are fixed in place on an x axis, with separation d.
Wire 1 has a current of 0.750 A, but the direction of the current is
not given. Wire 3, with a current of 0.250 A out of the page, can be
moved along the x axis to the right of wire 2. As wire 3 is moved,
the magnitude of the net magnetic force F, on wire 2 due to the
currents in wires 1 and 3 changes. The x component of that force is
F,, and the value per unit length of wire 2 is Fy,/L>. Figure 29-65b
gives F,/L5 versus the position x of wire 3. The plot has an asymp-
tote F,,/L) = —0.627 wN/m as x > ~. The horizontal scale is set by
