Module 29-4 Solenoids and Toroids

*49 A toroid having a square cross section, 5.00 cm on aside, and
an inner radius of 15.0 cm has 500 turns and carries a current of 0.800
A. (It is made up of a square solenoid—instead of a round one as in
Fig, 29-17—bent into a doughnut shape.) What is the magnetic field
inside the toroid at (a) the inner radius and (b) the outer radius?

°50 A solenoid that is 95.0 cm long has a radius of 2.00 cm and
a winding of 1200 turns; it carries a current of 3.60 A. Calculate
the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid.

*51 A 200-turn solenoid having a length of 25 cm and a diameter
of 10 cm carries a current of 0.29 A. Calculate the magnitude of the
magnetic field B inside the solenoid.

*52_A solenoid 1.30 mlong and 2.60 cm in diameter carries a cur
rent of 18.0 A. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is 23.0 mT.
Find the length of the wire forming the solenoid.

°°53 A long solenoid has 100 turns/em and carries current i. An
electron moves within the solenoid in a circle of radius 2.30 cm
perpendicular to the solenoid axis. The speed of the electron is
0.0460c (c = speed of light). Find the current i in the solenoid.

*54 An electron is shot into one end of a solenoid. As it
enters the uniform magnetic field within the solenoid, its speed
is 800 m/s and its velocity vector makes an angle of 30° with the
central axis of the solenoid. The solenoid carries 4.0 A and has
8000 turns along its length. How many revolutions does the elec-
tron make along its helical path within the solenoid by the time it
emerges from the solenoid’s opposite end? (In a real solenoid,
where the field is not uniform at the two ends, the number of rev-
olutions would be slightly less than the answer here.)

55 SSM ILW www A long solenoid with 10.0 turns/em and a
radius of 7.00 cm carries a current of 20.0mA. A current of 6.00 A
exists in a straight conductor located along the central axis of the sole-
noid. (a) At what radial distance from the axis will the direction of the
resulting magnetic field be at 45.0° to
the axial direction? (b) What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field there? V V/

300 turns of wire around a wooden cylinder of diameter d = 5.0 cm.
The coil is connected to a battery producing a current of 4.0 A in
the wire. (a) What is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment

field have the magnitude 5.0 ~T (approximately one-tenth that of
Earth’s magnetic field)?

60 @ In Fig. 29-74a, two circular loops, with different
currents but the same radius of 4.0 cm, are centered on a y axis.
They are initially separated by distance L = 3.0 cm, with loop 2 po-
sitioned at the origin of the axis. The currents in the two loops pro-
duce a net magnetic field at the origin, with y component B,. That
component is to be measured as loop 2 is gradually moved in the
positive direction of the y axis. Figure 29-74b gives B, as a function
of the position y of loop 2. The curve approaches an asymptote of
B, = 7.20 wT as y > ~, The horizontal scale is set by y, = 10.0 cm.
What are (a) current j; in loop 1 and (b) current i; in loop 2?
