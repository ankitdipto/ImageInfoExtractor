64 In Fig. 29-77, a closed loop carries
current i = 200 mA. The loop consists
of two radial straight wires and two
concentric circular ares of radii 2.00 m
and 4.00 m.The angle @is 7/4 rad. What
are the (a) magnitude and (b) direction
(into or out of the page) of the net
magnetic field at the center of

66 Two long wires lie in an xy plane, and each carries a current in
the positive direction of the x axis. Wire 1 is at y = 10.0 cm and car-
ries 6.00 A; wire 2 is at y = 5.00 cm and carries 10.0 A. (a) In unit-

67 Two wires, both of length L, are formed into a circle and a
square, and each carries current i. Show that the square produces a
greater magnetic field at its center than the circle produces at its
center.

68 A long straight wire carries a current of 50 A. An electron,
traveling at 1.0 X 107 m/s, is 5.0 cm from the wire. What is the mag-
nitude of the magnetic force on the electron if the electron velocity
is directed (a) toward the wire, (b) parallel to the wire in the direc-
tion of the current, and (c) perpendicular to the two directions de-
fined by (a) and (b)?

69 Three long wires are parallel to
az axis, and each carries a current of
10 A in the positive z direction. Their y \
points of intersection with the xy
plane form an equilateral triangle
with sides of 50 cm, as shown in Fig.
29-78. A fourth wire (wire b) passes
through the midpoint of the base of
the triangle and is parallel to the
other three wires. If the net magnetic
force on wire a is zero, what are the
(a) size and (b) direction (+z or —z) of the current in wire b?

CHAPTER 29 MAGNETIC FIELDS DUE TO CURRENTS

70 Figure 29-79 shows a closed loop
with current i = 2.00 A. The loop con-
sists of a half-circle of radius 4.00 m,
two quarter-circles each of radius 2.00
m, and three radial straight wires.
What is the magnitude of the net mag-
netic field at the common center of the
circular sections?

 

71 A 10-gauge bare copper wire Figure 29-79 Problem 70.
(2.6 mm in diameter) can carry a current of 50 A without overheat-
ing. For this current, what is the magnitude of the magnetic field at
the surface of the wire?

72 A long vertical wire carries an unknown current. Coaxial with
the wire isa long, thin, cylindrical conducting surface that carries a
current of 30 mA upward. The cylindrical surface has a radius of
3.0 mm. If the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 5.0mm
from the wire is 1.0 T, what are the (a) size and (b) direction of
the current in the wire?

73. Figure 29-80 shows a cross section of a
long cylindrical conductor of radius a = 4.00 cm
containing a long cylindrical hole of radius
b = 1.50 cm. The central axes of the cylinder
and hole are parallel and are distance d =
2.00 cm apart; current i = 5.25 A is uniformly

distributed over the tinted area. (a) What is jd)
the magnitude of the magnetic field at the Figure 29-80

cial cases b = Oandd = 0.

74 The magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 88.0 cm from
the central axis of a long straight wire is 7.30 uT. What is the cur-
rent in the wire?

75 SSM Figure 29-81 shows a wire :

segment of length As = 3.0 cm, cen-
tered at the origin, carrying current
i =2.0A in the positive y direction (as
part of some complete circuit). To cal-
culate the magnitude of the magnetic >
field B produced by the segment at a >
point several meters from the origin,
we can use B = (jug/47)i As (sin @)/r2as
the Biot—Savart law. This is because r
and @ are essentially constant over the
segment. Calculate B (in unit-vector notation) at the (x, y, z) coor-
dinates (a) (0, 0, 5.0m), (b) (0, 6.0 m, 0), (c) (7.0 m, 7.0 m, 0), and (d)
(—3.0 m, —4.0 m, 0).

wires spaced by distance d = 10.0 cm; each carries 100 A, out of the
page in wire 1. Point Pis ona perpendicular bisector of the line con-
necting the wires. In unit-vector notation, what is the net magnetic
field at P if the current in wire 2 is (a) out of the page and (b) into the

page?
