5.0 mT. At what distance from the wire is the net magnetic field
equal to zero?

79 A long, hollow, cylindrical conductor (with inner radius 2.0
mm and outer radius 4.0 mm) carries a current of 24 A distrib-
uted uniformly across its cross section. A long thin wire that is co-
axial with the cylinder carries a current of 24 A in the opposite
direction. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field (a) 1.0 mm,
(b) 3.0 mm, and (c) 5.0 mm from the central axis of the wire and
cylinder?

80 A long wire is known to have a radius greater than 4.0 mm and
to carry a current that is uniformly distributed over its cross section.
The magnitude of the magnetic field due to that current is 0.28 mT
ata point 4.0 mm from the axis of the wire, and 0.20 mT at a point 10
mm from the axis of the wire. What is the radius of the wire?

Projectile P sits between two wide rails of circular cross section; a
source of current sends current through the rails and through the
(conducting) projectile (a fuse is not used). (a) Let w be the dis-
tance between the rails, R the radius of each rail, and i the current.

the rails and is given approximately by
