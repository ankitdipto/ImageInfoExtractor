868 CHAPTER 30 INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE

Calculations: Because coil C consists of more than one
turn, we apply Faraday’s law in the form of Eq. 30-5
(€ = —N d®,/dt), where the number of turns N is 130 and
d®,/dt is the rate at which the flux changes.

Because the current in the solenoid decreases at a
steady rate, flux ®z also decreases at a steady rate,and so we
can write d®,/dt as A®;/At. Then, to evaluate AD, we need
the final and initial flux values. The final flux ®p ; is zero be-
cause the final current in the solenoid is zero. To find the ini-
tial flux pj, we note that area A is td? (= 3.464 x 10+ m?)
and the number n is 220 turns/cm, or 22 000 turns/m. Sub-
stituting Eq. 29-23 into Eq. 30-2 then leads to

5, = BA = (oin)A
= (4 X 10-7 T-m/A)(1.5 A)(22 000 turns/m)
x (3.464 x 10-4 m?)
= 144 x 10 Wb.

Lenz’s Law

Soon after Faraday proposed his law of induction, Heinrich Friedrich Lenz
devised a rule for determining the direction of an induced current ina loop:

oS An induced current has a direction such that the magnetic field due to the current
opposes the change in the magnetic flux that induces the current.

Furthermore, the direction of an induced emf is that of the induced current. The
key word in Lenz’s law is “opposition.” Let’s apply the law to the motion of the
north pole toward the conducting loop in Fig. 30-4.

1. Opposition to Pole Movement. The approach of the magnet’s north pole in

The magnet’s motion
creates a magnetic
dipole that opposes
the motion.

 

Figure 30-4 Lenz’s law at work. As the mag-
net is moved toward the loop, a current is
induced in the loop. The current produces
its own magnetic field, with magnetic di-
pole moment / oriented so as to oppose
the motion of the magnet.Thus, the in-
duced current must be counterclockwise
as shown.

Fig. 30-4 increases the magnetic flux through the loop and thereby induces a
current in the loop. From Fig. 29-22, we know that the loop then acts as a
magnetic dipole with a south pole and a north pole, and that its magnetic
dipole moment / is directed from south to north. To oppose the magnetic
flux increase being caused by the approaching magnet, the loop’s north pole
(and thus #2) must face toward the approaching north pole so as to repel it
(Fig. 30-4). Then the curled—straight right-hand rule for @ (Fig. 29-22) tells
us that the current induced in the loop must be counterclockwise in Fig. 30-4.

If we next pull the magnet away from the loop, a current will again be
induced in the loop. Now, however, the loop will have a south pole facing
the retreating north pole of the magnet, so as to oppose the retreat. Thus, the
induced current will be clockwise.

. Opposition to Flux Change. In Fig. 30-4, with the magnet initially distant, no

magnetic flux passes through the loop. As the north pole of the magnet then
nears the loop with its magnetic field B directed downward, the flux through
the loop increases. To oppose this increase in flux, the induced current i must
set up its own field Bia directed upward inside the loop, as shown in Fig. 30-Sa;
then the upward flux of field Baa opposes the increasing downward flux of
field B. The curled-straight right-hand rule of Fig. 29-22 then tells us that i
must be counterclockwise in Fig. 30-Sa.
