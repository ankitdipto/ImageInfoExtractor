30-1 FARADAY’S LAW AND LENZ’S LAW 869

Heads Up. The flux of Bigg always opposes the change in the flux of B, but
Bigg is not always opposite B. For example, if we next pull the magnet away
from the loop in Fig. 30-4, the magnet’s flux ®g is still downward through the
loop, but it is now decreasing. The flux of Boa must now be downward inside
the loop, to oppose that decrease (Fig. 30-5b). Thus, B,,4 and B are now in the
same direction. In Figs. 30-5c and d, the south pole of the magnet approaches
and retreats from the loop, again with opposition to change.

Figure 30-5 The direction of the current i induced ina loop is such that the current’s magnetic field Baa opposes the change in the magnetic
field B inducing i. The field B,,, is always directed opposite an increasing field B (a, c) and in the same direction as a decreasing field
B (b, d). The curled—straight right-hand rule gives the direction of the induced current based on the direction of the induced field.

VJ Checkpoint 2

The figure shows three situations in which identical circular
conducting loops are in uniform magnetic fields that are either
increasing (Inc) or decreasing (Dec) in magnitude at identical rates.
In each, the dashed line coincides with a diameter. Rank the situa-
tions according to the magnitude of the current induced in the loops,
greatest first.
