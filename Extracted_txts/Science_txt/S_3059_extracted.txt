Sample Problem 30.02

Figure 30-6 shows a conducting loop consisting of a half-circle
of radius r= 0.20m and three straight sections The half-
circle lies in a uniform magnetic field B that is directed out
of the page; the field magnitude is given by B = 4.07? +
2.0t + 3.0, with B in teslas and ¢ in seconds. An ideal battery
with emf €,,. = 2.0 V is connected to the loop. The resistance
of the loop is 2.0.0.

(a) What are the magnitude and direction of the emf Gigg
induced around the loop by field B att = 10s?

KEY IDEAS

 

1. According to Faraday’s law, the magnitude of Ging is
equal to the rate d®g/dt at which the magnetic flux
through the loop changes.

2. The flux through the loop depends on how much of the
loop’s area lies within the flux and how the area is ori-
ented in the magnetic field B.

3. Because B is uniform and is perpendicular to the plane
of the loop, the flux is given by Eq. 30-2 (Pg = BA).
(We don’t need to integrate B over the area to get
the flux.)

4. The induced field Bj,y (due to the induced current) must
always oppose the change in the magnetic flux.

Magnitude: Using Eq. 30-2 and realizing that only the field
magnitude B changes in time (not the area A), we rewrite
Faraday’s law, Eq. 30-4, as

Because the flux penetrates the loop only within the half-
circle, the area A in this equation is par. Substituting this
and the given expression for B yields

Sample Problem 30.03

Figure 30-7 shows a rectangular loop of wire immersed in a
nonuniform and varying magnetic field B that is perpendi-
cular to and directed into the page. The field’s magnitude is
given by B = 4/°x?, with B in teslas, t in seconds, and x in
meters. (Note that the function depends on both time and
position.) The loop has width W = 3.0 m and height H =
2.0 m. What are the magnitude and direction of the induced
emf @ around the loop att = 0.10 s?

Figure 30-6 A battery is connected to a conducting loop that
includes a half-circle of radius r lying in a uniform magnetic

field. The field is directed out of the page; its magnitude is
changing.

Direction: To find the direction of ig, we first note that in
Fig. 30-6 the flux through the loop is out of the page and in-
creasing. Because the induced field B;,, (due to the induced
current) must oppose that increase, it must be into the page.
Using the curled—straight right-hand rule (Fig. 30-5c), we find
that the induced current is clockwise around the loop, and
thus so is the induced emf € ing.

(b) What is the current in the loop att = 10s?

KEY IDEA

 

The point here is that two emfs tend to move charges
around the loop.

Calculation: The induced emf €jgg tends to drive a current
clockwise around the loop; the battery’s emf @;,, tends to
drive a current counterclockwise. Because €jnq is greater
than €ja, the net emf €,.; is clockwise, and thus so is the
current. To find the current at t= 10s, we use Eq. 27-2

Induced emf due to a changing nonuniform B field

KEY IDEAS

 

1. Because the magnitude of the magnetic field B is chang-
ing with time, the magnetic flux ®, through the loop is
also changing.

2. The changing flux induces an emf € in the loop according
to Faraday’s law, which we can write as € = d®,/dt.

3. To use that law, we need an expression for the flux ®g at
