30-2 INDUCTION AND ENERGY TRANSFERS 873

As x decreases, the flux decreases. Faraday’s law tells us that with this flux
decrease, an emf is induced in the loop. Dropping the minus sign in Eq. 30-4 and
using Eq. 30-7, we can write the magnitude of this emf as

_ d®, d

dx
= — BLx = —= 30-
i 7 BLx = BL 7 BLy, (30-8)

 

in which we have replaced dx/dt with v, the speed at which the loop moves.

Figure 30-9 shows the loop as a circuit: induced emf @ is represented on the
left, and the collective resistance R of the loop is represented on the right.
The direction of the induced current i is obtained with a right-hand rule as in
Fig. 30-5b for decreasing flux; applying the rule tells us that the current must be
clockwise, and € must have the same direction.

Induced Current. To find the magnitude of the induced current, we cannot
apply the loop rule for potential differences in a circuit because, as you will see in
Module 30-3, we cannot define a potential difference for an induced emf.
However, we can apply the equation i = €/R. With Eq. 30-8, this becomes

R”
Because three segments of the loop in Fig. 30-8 carry this current through the

magnetic field, sideways deflecting forces act on those segments. From Eq. 28-26
we know that such a deflecting force is, in general notation,

F, = iL x B. (30-10)

 

i= (30-9)

In Fig. 30-8, the deflecting forces acting on the three segments of the loop are
marked F, F, and F. Note, however, that from the symmetry, forces F, and F,
are equal in magnitude and cancel. This leaves only force F, which i is directed
opposite your force F onthe loop and thus is the force opposing you. So, F=-F.

Using Eq. 30-10 to obtain the magnitude of F, and noting that the angle
between B and the length vector L for the left segment is 90°, we write

F = F, =iLBsin 90° = iLB. (30-11)
Substituting Eq. 30-9 for iin Eq. 30-11 then gives us

Because B, L,and R are constants, the speed v at which you move the loop is con-
stant if the magnitude F of the force you apply to the loop is also constant.
Rate of Work. By substituting Eq. 30-12 into Eq. 30-6, we find the rate at
which you do work on the loop as you pull it from the magnetic field:

(rate of doing work). (30-13)

Thermal Energy. To complete our analysis, let us find the rate at which
thermal energy appears in the loop as you pull it along at constant speed. We
calculate it from Eq. 26-27,

 

 

P=?PR. (30-14)
Substituting for i from Eq. 30-9, we find
BLy\ BL?
P= ( a) R=—% V" (thermal energy rate), (30-15)

which is exactly equal to the rate at which you are doing work on the loop
(Eq. 30-13). Thus, the work that you do in pulling the loop through the magnetic
field appears as thermal energy in the loop.
