CHAPTER 30 INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE

The figure shows five lettered regions in which a uniform magnetic field extends either
directly out of the page or into the page, with the direction indicated only for region a.
The field is increasing in magnitude at the same steady rate in all five regions; the
regions are identical in area. Also shown are four numbered paths along which § E- ds
has the magnitudes given below in terms of a quantity “mag.” Determine whether the
magnetic field is directed into or out of the page for regions b through e.

Sample Problem 30.04

In Fig. 30-11b, take R = 8.5 cm and dB/dt = 0.13 T/s.

(a) Find an expression for the magnitude E of the induced
electric field at points within the magnetic field, at radius r
from the center of the magnetic field. Evaluate the expres-
sion for r = 5.2 cm.

KEY IDEA

 

An electric field is induced by the changing magnetic field,
according to Faraday’s law.

Calculations: To calculate the field magnitude E, we ap-
ply Faraday’s law in the form of Eq. 30-20. We use a circu-
lar path of integration with radius r= R because we want
E for points within the magnetic field. We assume from
the symmetry that E in Fig. 30-11b is tangent to the circu-
lar path at all points. The path vector ds is also always tan-
gent to the circular path; so the dot product E-ds in Eq.
30-20 must have the magnitude E ds at all points on the
path. We can also assume from the symmetry that E has
the same value at all points along the circular path. Then
the left side of Eq. 30-20 becomes

$ E-dg = $ Eds=E $ ds = E(2mr). (30-23)

(The integral ¢ ds is the circumference 2ar of the circular
path.)

Next, we need to evaluate the right side of Eq. 30-20.
Because B is uniform over the area A encircled by the path
of integration and is directed perpendicular to that area, the
magnetic flux is given by Eq. 30-2:

®; = BA = B(ar?). (30-24)
Substituting this and Eq. 30-23 into Eq. 30-20 and dropping

Equation 30-25 gives the magnitude of the electric field at
any point for which r = R (that is, within the magnetic field).

(b) Find an expression for the magnitude E of the induced
electric field at points that are outside the magnetic field, at
radius r from the center of the magnetic field. Evaluate the
expression for r = 12.5 cm.

KEY IDEAS

Here again an electric field is induced by the changing mag-
netic field, according to Faraday’s law, except that now we
use a circular path of integration with radius r = R because
we want to evaluate E for points outside the magnetic field.
Proceeding as in (a), we again obtain Eq. 30-23. However,
we do not then obtain Eq. 30-24 because the new path of
integration is now outside the magnetic field, and so the
magnetic flux encircled by the new path is only that in the
area 7R? of the magnetic field region.

Calculations: We can now write

®, = BA = B(nR?). (30-26)
