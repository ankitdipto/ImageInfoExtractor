Substituting this and Eq. 30-23 into Eq. 30-20 (without the
minus sign) and solving for E yield
_ R dB
- 2r dt”
Because E is not zero here, we know that an electric field is
induced even at points that are outside the changing mag-
netic field, an important result that (as you will see in
Module 31-6) makes transformers possible.
With the given data, Eq. 30-27 yields the magnitude of
Eatr=125 cm:

Equations 30-25 and 30-27 give the same result for
r = R. Figure 30-12 shows a plot of E(r). Note that the in-
side and outside plots meet at r= R.

@ An inductor is a device that can be used to produce a known
magnetic field in a specified region. If a current iis established

through each of the N windings of an inductor, a magnetic flux

(inductance defined).

@ The SI unit of inductance is the henry (H), where 1 henry =
1H=1T-m/A.

@ The inductance per unit length near the middle of a long so-
lenoid of cross-sectional area A and n turns per unit length is

TT = yA

(solenoid).

 

Inductors and Inductance

We found in Chapter 25 that a capacitor can be used to produce a desired elec-
tric field. We considered the parallel-plate arrangement as a basic type of ca-
pacitor. Similarly, an inductor (symbol .2999,) can be used to produce a desired
magnetic field. We shall consider a long solenoid (more specifically, a short
length near the middle of a long solenoid, to avoid any fringing effects) as our
basic type of inductor.

If we establish a current i in the windings (turns) of the solenoid we are
taking as our inductor, the current produces a magnetic flux ®, through the
central region of the inductor. The inductance of the inductor is then defined in
terms of that flux as

L = —— (inductance defined), (30-28)
