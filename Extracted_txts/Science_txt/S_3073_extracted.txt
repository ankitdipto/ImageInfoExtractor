CHAPTER 30 INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE

rs
or L Fa + Ri=E (RL circuit). (30-39)

Equation 30-39 is a differential equation involving the variable i and its first
derivative di/dt. To solve it, we seek the function i(t) such that when i(t) and its
first derivative are substituted in Eq. 30-39, the equation is satisfied and the initial
condition i(0) = 0 is satisfied.

Equation 30-39 and its initial condition are of exactly the form of Eq. 27-32
for an RC circuit, with i replacing qg, L replacing R, and R replacing 1/C. The solu-
tion of Eq. 30-39 must then be of exactly the form of Eq. 27-33 with the same
replacements. That solution is

i= eh), (30-40)

which we can rewrite as

 

é
Fr (1 =e") (rise of current). (30-41)
Here 7,, the inductive time constant, is given by
iE
1 Re (time constant). (30-42)

Let’s examine Eq. 30-41 for just after the switch is closed (at time tf = 0) and
for a time long after the switch is closed (t— ~~). If we substitute t = 0 into
Eq. 30-41, the exponential becomes e~? = 1. Thus, Eq. 30-41 tells us that the cur-
rent is initially i = 0, as we expected. Next, if we let f go to ~, then the exponential
goes to e~* = 0. Thus, Eq. 30-41 tells us that the current goes to its equilibrium
value of €/R.

We can also examine the potential differences in the circuit. For example,
Fig. 30-17 shows how the potential differences Vg (= iR) across the resistor and
V_ (= L dildt) across the inductor vary with time for particular values of €, L,
and R. Compare this figure carefully with the corresponding figure for an RC
circuit (Fig. 27-16).
