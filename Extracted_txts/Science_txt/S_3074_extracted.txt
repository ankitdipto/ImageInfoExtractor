To show that the quantity 7, (= L/R) has the dimension of time (as it must,
because the argument of the exponential function in Eq. 30-41 must be dimen-
sionless), we convert from henries per ohm as follows:

ea LV-s ) (ABA) =15

Qa  aO\1HA/\ iv J 0%

The first quantity in parentheses is a conversion factor based on Eq. 30-35, and
the second one is a conversion factor based on the relation V = iR.

Time Constant. The physical significance of the time constant follows from
Eq. 30-41. If we put ¢ = 7, = L/R in this equation, it reduces to

i=l et) = 0635 (30-43)

Thus, the time constant 7, is the time it takes the current in the circuit to reach
about 63% of its final equilibrium value €/R. Since the potential difference Vp
across the resistor is proportional to the current i, a graph of the increasing
current versus time has the same shape as that of Vp in Fig. 30-17a.

Current Decay. If the switch S in Fig. 30-15 is closed ona long enough for the
equilibrium current /R to be established and then is thrown to b, the effect will
be to remove the battery from the circuit. (The connection to b must actually be
made an instant before the connection to a is broken. A switch that does this is
called a make-before-break switch.) With the battery gone, the current through
the resistor will decrease. However, it cannot drop immediately to zero but must
decay to zero over time. The differential equation that governs the decay can be
found by putting € = 0 in Eq. 30-39:

di
L— +iR=0. 30-44
a! (30-44)

By analogy with Eqs. 27-38 and 27-39, the solution of this differential equation
that satisfies the initial condition i(0) = ig = €/R is

é
i= R e-t = jge™ (decay of current). (30-45)

We see that both current rise (Eq. 30-41) and current decay (Eq. 30-45) in an RL
circuit are governed by the same inductive time constant, 7;,.

We have used iy in Eq. 30-45 to represent the current at time ¢ = 0. In our
case that happened to be €/R, but it could be any other initial value.

The figure shows three circuits with identical batteries, inductors, and resistors. Rank
the circuits according to the current through the battery (a) just after the switch is
closed and (b) a long time later, greatest first. (If you have trouble here, work through
the next sample problem and then try again.)
