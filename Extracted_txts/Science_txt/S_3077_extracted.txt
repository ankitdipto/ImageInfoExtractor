sss CHAPTER 30 INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE

We can write this as

dUpz = Lidi.
Integrating yields
Up i
I dUz = [ Li di
lo lo
or Uz =3Li (magnetic energy), (30-49)

which represents the total energy stored by an inductor L carrying a current i.
Note the similarity in form between this expression for the energy stored in a
magnetic field and the expression for the energy stored in an electric field by a

 

capacitor with capacitance C and charge q;namely,

(The variable /* corresponds to q’, and the constant L corresponds to 1/C.)

Sample Problem 30.07 Energy stored in a magnetic field

A coil has an inductance of 53 mH and a resistance of
0.35 0.

(a) If a 12 V emfis applied across the coil, how much energy
is stored in the magnetic field after the current has built up
to its equilibrium value?

KEY IDEA

 

The energy stored in the magnetic field of a coil at any time
depends on the current through the coil at that time, accord-
ing to Eq. 30-49 (Uz = 5Li?).

Calculations: Thus, to find the energy U,.. stored at equi-
librium, we must first find the equilibrium current. From
Eg. 30-41, the equilibrium current is

 

   

€ 12V
i= R 03507 34.3 A. (30-51)
Then substitution yields
Ups = 3Li2 = (53 X 10-7 H)(34.3 A)>
=31J. (Answer)

(b) After how many time constants will half this equilibrium
energy be stored in the magnetic field?

Calculations: Now we are being asked: At what time ¢ will
the relation

Un = 5 Up.

Rwitey

be satisfied? Using Eq. 30-49 twice allows us to rewrite this
energy condition as

Le = Ohne

1

or i= (J) in. (30-52)
This equation tells us that, as the current increases from its
initial value of 0 to its final value of i.., the magnetic field
will have half its final stored energy when the current has in-
creased to this value. In general, we know that i is given by
Eq. 30-41, and here i,, (see Eq. 30-51) is €/R; so Eq. 30-52
becomes

oC) ae
R & )= ar
By canceling @/R and rearranging, we can write this as
etz=1— Sad = 0.293,
which yields
t
— = —In 0.293 = 1.23
i,
or t~127,. (Answer)

Thus, the energy stored in the magnetic field of the coil by
the current will reach half its equilibrium value 1.2 time
constants after the emf is applied.
