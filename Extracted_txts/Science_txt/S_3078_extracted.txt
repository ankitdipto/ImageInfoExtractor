Energy Density of a Magnetic Field

Consider a length / near the middle of a long solenoid of cross-sectional area A
carrying current i; the volume associated with this length is Al. The energy Ug
stored by the length / of the solenoid must lie entirely within this volume because
the magnetic field outside such a solenoid is approximately zero. Moreover,
the stored energy must be uniformly distributed within the solenoid because the
magnetic field is (approximately) uniform everywhere inside.

Thus, the energy stored per unit volume of the field is

Here L is the inductance of length / of the solenoid.
Substituting for L// from Eq. 30-31, we find
up = dun? (30-54)

write this energy density as

un (magnetic energy density). ( )

This equation gives the density of stored energy at any point where the magni-
tude of the magnetic field is B. Even though we derived it by considering the
special case of a solenoid, Eq. 30-55 holds for all magnetic fields, no matter how
they are generated. The equation is comparable to Eq. 25-25,

ug= 5e0E?, (30-56)

which gives the energy density (in a vacuum) at any point in an electric field.
Note that both wg and uw; are proportional to the square of the appropriate field
magnitude, B or E.
