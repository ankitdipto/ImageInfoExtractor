the definition of inductance. We can recast Eq. 30-57 as

If we cause i; to vary with time by varying R, we have

The right side of this equation is, according to Faraday’s law, just the magnitude
of the emf €, appearing in coil 2 due to the changing current in coil 1. Thus, with a
minus sign to indicate direction,

€. = —My, a. (30-61)
which you should compare with Eq. 30-35 for self-induction (€ = —L di/dt).
Interchange. Let us now interchange the roles of coils 1 and 2, as in Fig. 30-19;
that is, we set up a current i, in coil 2 by means of a battery, and this produces a
magnetic flux ®,, that links coil 1. If we change & with time by varying R, we then
have, by the argument given above,
di.
€,=-My aT (30-62)
Thus, we see that the emf induced in either coil is proportional to the rate of
change of current in the other coil. The proportionality constants My; and My)
seem to be different. However, they turn out to be the same, although we cannot
prove that fact here. Thus, we have

Mz, = Mp = M, (30-63)
and we can rewrite Eqs. 30-61 and 30-62 as

Figure 30-19 Mutual induction. (a) The mag-
netic field B, produced by current i, in coil
1extends through coil 2. If i, is varied (by
varying resistance R), an emf is induced in
coil 2 and current registers on the meter
connected to coil 2. (b) The roles of the
coils interchanged.
