CHAPTER 30 INDUCTION AND INDUCTANCE

Sample Problem 30.08 Mutual inductance of two parallel coils

Figure 30-20 shows two circular close-packed coils, the
smaller (radius R>, with N> turns) being coaxial with the
larger (radius Rj, with N, turns) and in the same plane.

(a) Derive an expression for the mutual inductance M for
this arrangement of these two coils, assuming that R; > Ro.

KEY IDEA

 

The mutual inductance M for these coils is the ratio of the
flux linkage (N®) through one coil to the current i in the
other coil, which produces that flux linkage. Thus, we need
to assume that currents exist in the coils; then we need to
calculate the flux linkage in one of the coils.

Calculations: The magnetic field through the larger coil
due to the smaller coil is nonuniform in both magnitude and
direction; so the flux through the larger coil due to the
smaller coil is nonuniform and difficult to calculate.
However, the smaller coil is small enough for us to assume
that the magnetic field through it due to the larger coil is ap-
proximately uniform. Thus, the flux through it due to the
larger coil is also approximately uniform. Hence, to find M
we shall assume a current i, in the larger coil and calculate
the flux linkage N,®», in the smaller coil:

M (30-66)
The flux ®,; through each turn of the smaller coil is,
from Eq. 30-2,

Dy = BiAp,

where B, is the magnitude of the magnetic field at points
within the small coil due to the larger coil and A) (= 773) is
the area enclosed by the turn. Thus, the flux linkage in the
smaller coil (with its N, turns) is

Nyy, = NyByAp. (30-67)

To find B, at points within the smaller coil, we can use
Eq. 29-26,

Moi R?
2(R? + 2232”
with z set to 0 because the smaller coil is in the plane of the
larger coil. That equation tells us that each turn of the larger
coil produces a magnetic field of magnitude ppi;/2R, at
points within the smaller coil. Thus, the larger coil (with its
N, turns) produces a total magnetic field of magnitude

at points within the smaller coil.

Figure 30-20 A small coil is located at the center of a large coil. The
mutual inductance of the coils can be determined by sending
current i, through the large coil.

Substituting Eq. 30-68 for B, and 7R3 for A, in Eq. 30-67

(b) What is the value of M for N; = N,=1200 turns,
Ry = 1.1 cm, and R, = 15 cm?

Calculations: Equation 30-69 yields

= 229 x 10 7H ~ 23 mH. (Answer)

Consider the situation if we reverse the roles of the two
coils—that is, if we produce a current i, in the smaller coil
and try to calculate M from Eq. 30-57 in the form
NP iy

i,
The calculation of ®,) (the nonuniform flux of the smaller
coil’s magnetic field encompassed by the larger coil) is not
simple. If we were to do the calculation numerically using
a computer, we would find M to be 2.3 mH, as above! This
emphasizes that Eq. 30-63 (M2, = M,) = M) is not obvious.
