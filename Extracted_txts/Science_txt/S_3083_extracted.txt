22b gives the z components B, of the fields versus time f. (Plots 1
and 3 are parallel; so are plots 4 and 6. Plots 2 and 5 are parallel
to the time axis.) Rank the six plots according to the emf induced
in the loop, greatest clockwise emf first, greatest counterclock-
wise emf last.

3 In Fig. 30-23, a long straight wire with current i passes (without
touching) three rectangular wire loops with edge lengths L, 1.5L,
and 2L. The loops are widely spaced (so as not to affect one an-
other). Loops 1 and 3 are symmetric about the long wire. Rank the
loops according to the size of the current induced in them if cur-
rent iis (a) constant and (b) increasing, greatest first.

4 Figure 30-24 shows two circuits in which a conducting bar is slid
at the same speed v through the same uniform magnetic field and
along a U-shaped wire. The parallel lengths of the wire are sepa-
rated by 2Z in circuit 1 and by L in circuit 2. The current induced in
circuit 1 is counterclockwise. (a) Is the magnetic field into or out of
the page? (b) Is the current induced in circuit 2 clockwise or coun-
terclockwise? (c) Is the emf induced in circuit 1 larger than, smaller
than, or the same as that in circuit 2?

6 In Fig. 30-26, a wire loop has been bent so that it has three seg-
ments: segment be (a quarter-circle), ac (a square corner), and ab
(straight). Here are three choices for a magnetic field through the
loop:
