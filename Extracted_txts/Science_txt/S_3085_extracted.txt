*7 In Fig. 30-38, the magnetic flux «
through the loop increases according to ,
the relation ®, = 6.0f + 7.0f, where Pz is
in milliwebers and fis in seconds. (a) What
is the magnitude of the emf induced in the
loop when t = 2.0 s? (b) Is the direction of
the current through R to the right or left? ,

*8 A uniform magnetic field B is per- «
pendicular to the plane of a circular loop
of diameter 10cm formed from wire of
diameter 2.5mm and resistivity 1.69 x
10-*Q-m. At what rate must the magni-
tude of B change to induce a 10 A current in the loop?

*9 A small loop of area 6.8 mm’ is placed inside a long solenoid
that has 854 turns/cm and carries a sinusoidally varying current i of
amplitude 1.28 A and angular frequency 212 rad/s. The central axes
of the loop and solenoid coincide. What is the amplitude of the emf
induced in the loop?

10 Figure 30-39 shows a closed
loop of wire that consists of a pair of
equal semicircles, of radius 3.7 cm,
lying in mutually perpendicular
planes. The loop was formed by fold-
ing a flat circular loop along a diam-
eter until the two halves became
perpendicular to each other. A uni-
form magnetic field B of magnitude
76 mT is directed perpendicular to
the fold diameter and makes equal
angles (of 45°) with the planes of the
semicircles. The magnetic field is reduced to zero at a uniform rate
during a time interval of 4.5 ms. During this interval, what are
the (a) magnitude and (b) direction (clockwise or counterclock-
wise when viewed along the direction of B) of the emf induced in
the loop?

ee11 A rectangular coil of N turns and of length a and width b is
rotated at frequency fin a uniform magnetic field B, as indicated in
Fig. 30-40. The coil is connected to co-rotating cylinders, against
which metal brushes slide to make contact. (a) Show that the emf
induced in the coil is given (as a function of time t) by

€ = 2nfNabB sin(2-nft) = Ey sin(27ft).

This is the principle of the commercial alternating-current gen-
erator. (b) What value of Nab gives an emf with €) = 150 V
when the loop is rotated at 60.0 rev/s in a uniform magnetic field
of 0.500 T?

*13° ILW One hundred turns of (insulated) copper wire are
wrapped around a wooden cylindrical core of cross-sectional area
1.20 X 10-3 m*. The two ends of the wire are connected to a resis-
tor. The total resistance in the circuit is 13.0 ©. If an externally ap-
plied uniform longitudinal magnetic field in the core changes from
1.60 T in one direction to 1.60 T in the opposite direction, how
much charge flows through a point in the circuit during the change?

 

14 ® In Fig. 30-42a, a uniform magnetic field B increases in
magnitude with time ¢ as given by Fig. 30-42b, where the vertical
axis scale is set by B, = 9.0 mT and the horizontal scale is set by
t, = 3.0 s.A circular conducting loop of area 8.0 X 10-4 m? lies in
the field, in the plane of the page. The amount of charge q passing
point A on the loop is given in Fig. 30-42c as a function of f, with
the vertical axis scale set by g, = 6.0 mC and the horizontal axis
scale again set by t, = 3.0 s. What is the loop’s resistance?
