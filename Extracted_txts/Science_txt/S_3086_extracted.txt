and Bj. The fields are uniform within each region and directly out
of or into the page as indicated. Figure 30-44 gives the change in
the z components B; of the three fields with time ¢; the vertical axis
scale is set by B, = 4.0 wT and B, = —2.5B,, and the horizontal axis
scale is set by f, = 2.0 s. What are the (a) magnitude and (b) direc-
tion of the current induced in the wire?

  

*°17 A small circular loop of area 2.00 cm? is placed in the plane
of, and concentric with, a large circular loop of radius 1.00 m. The
current in the large loop is changed at a constant rate from 200 A
to —200 A (a change in direction) in a time of 1.00, starting at
t = 0. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field B at the center
of the small loop due to the current in the large loop at (a) f = 0,
(b) ¢ = 0.500 s, and (c) f = 1.00 s? (d) From ¢ = 0 to r= 1.005, is B
reversed? Because the inner loop is small, assume B is uniform over
its area. (e) What emf is induced in the small loop at t = 0.500 s?

 

18 In Fig. 30-45, two straight con-
ducting rails form a right angle. A
conducting bar in contact with the
rails starts at the vertex at time t = 0
and moves with a constant velocity
of 5.20 m/s along them. A magnetic
field with B=0.350T is directed
out of the page. Calculate (a) the
flux through the triangle formed by the rails and bar at t = 3.00s
and (b) the emf around the triangle at that time. (c) If the emf is
‘é = at", where aand»n are constants, what is the value of n?

**19 ILW An electric generator contains a coil of 100 turns of wire,
each forming a rectangular loop 50.0 cm by 30.0 cm. The coil is
placed entirely in a uniform magnetic field with magnitude B =
3.50 T and with B initially perpendicular to the coil’s plane. What
is the maximum value of the emf produced when the coil is spun at
1000 rev/min about an axis perpendicular to B?

*°20 At a certain place, Earth’s magnetic field has magnitude
B = 0.590 gauss and is inclined downward at an angle of 70.0° to
the horizontal. A flat horizontal circular coil of wire with a radius
of 10.0 cm has 1000 turns and a total resistance of 85.0 2. It is con-
nected in series to a meter with 140 © resistance. The coil is flipped
through a half-revolution about a diameter, so that it is again hori-
zontal. How much charge flows
through the meter during the flip?

magnetic field. What are the (a) fre-
quency and (b) amplitude of the emf
induced in the loop?

tween the field and the normal to
the plane of the loop is 7/2 rad and
increasing at 0.60 rad/s, what emf is x
induced in the loop?

counterclockwise current i in the larger loop is nearly uniform
throughout the smaller loop. Suppose that x is increasing at the
constant rate dx/dt = v. (a) Find an expression for the magnetic
flux through the area of the smaller loop as a function of x. (Hint:

circular segments, each of radius r =

segment is a quadrant of a circle,

the yz plane, and ca lying in the zx
plane. (a) If a uniform magnetic
field B points in the positive x direc-
tion, what is the magnitude of the
emf developed in the wire when B
