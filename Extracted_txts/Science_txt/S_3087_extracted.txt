Module 30-2 Induction and Energy Transfers
°29 In Fig. 30-52, a metal rod is
forced to move with constant veloc-
ity along two parallel metal rails,
connected with a strip of metal at
one end. A magnetic field of magni-
tude B= 0.350T points out of the
page. (a) If the rails are separated
by L = 25.0 cm and the speed of the
rod is 55.0 cm/s, what emf is gener-
ated? (b) If the rod has a resistance of 18.0 Q.and the rails and con-
nector have negligible resistance, what is the current in the rod?
(c) At what rate is energy being transferred to thermal energy?

30 In Fig. 30-53a, a circular loop of wire is concentric with a sole-
noid and lies in a plane perpendicular to the solenoid’s central axis.
The loop has radius 6.00 cm. The solenoid has radius 2.00 cm, con-
sists of 8000 turns/m, and has a current i,,, varying with time f as
given in Fig, 30-53b, where the vertical axis scale is set by i, = 1.00
A and the horizontal axis scale is set by t, = 2.0 s. Figure 30-53c
shows, as a function of time, the energy E,, that is transferred
to thermal energy of the loop; the vertical axis scale is set by E, =
100.0 nJ. What is the loop’s resistance?

length L = 10.0 cm that is forced to
move at constant speed v = 5.00 m/s
along horizontal rails. The rod, rails,
and connecting strip at the right
form a conducting loop. The rod has
resistance 0.400 Q; the rest of the
loop has negligible resistance. A cur-
rent i=100A through the long
straight wire at distance a = 10.0 mm
from the loop sets up a (nonuniform)
magnetic field through the loop. Find
the (a) emf and (b) current induced
in the loop. (c) At what rate is thermal energy generated in the
rod? (d) What is the magnitude of the force that must be applied to
the rod to make it move at constant speed? (e) At what rate does
this force do work on the rod?

39 The magnetic field of a cylindrical magnet that has a
pole-face diameter of 3.3 cm can be varied sinusoidally between
29.6 T and 30.0 T at a frequency of 15 Hz. (The current in a wire
wrapped around a permanent magnet is varied to give this varia-
tion in the net field.) At a radial distance of 1.6 cm, what is the
amplitude of the electric field induced by the variation?
