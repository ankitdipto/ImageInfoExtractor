Module 30-4 Inductors and Inductance

40 The inductance of a closely packed coil of 400 turns is
8.0 mH. Calculate the magnetic flux through the coil when the
current is 5.0 mA.

°41 A circular coil has a 10.0cm radius and consists of 30.0
closely wound turns of wire. An externally produced magnetic
field of magnitude 2.60 mT is perpendicular to the coil. (a) If no
current is in the coil, what magnetic flux links its turns? (b) When
the current in the coil is 3.80 A in a certain direction, the net
flux through the coil is found to vanish. What is the inductance of
the coil?

42 Figure 30-58 shows a copper strip of
width W = 16.0 cm that has been bent to form
a shape that consists of a tube of radius
R=1.8cm plus two parallel flat extensions.
Current i= 35 mA is distributed uniformly
across the width so that the tube is effectively
a one-turn solenoid. Assume that the magnetic
field outside the tube is negligible and the <
field inside the tube is uniform. What are (a)
the magnetic field magnitude inside the tube
and (b) the inductance of the tube (excluding
the flat extensions)?
