*°77 SSM Two coils connected as

shown in Fig. 30-70 separately have inductances L; and L,. Their
mutual inductance is M. (a) Show that this combination can be re-
placed by a single coil of equivalent inductance given by

Leg = Ly + Ly + 2M.

(b) How could the coils in Fig. 30-70 be reconnected to yield an
equivalent inductance of

(This problem is an extension of Problem 47, but the requirement
that the coils be far apart has been removed.)

Additional Problems

78 At time t=O, a 12.0V potential difference is suddenly
applied to the leads of a coil of inductance 23.0 mH and a certain
resistance R. At time f = 0.150 ms, the current through the induc-
tor is changing at the rate of 280 A/s. Evaluate R.

79 SSM In Fig. 30-71, the battery is
ideal and €=10V, R; =5.0 Q,
R, = 10 Q,and L = 5.0 H. Switch S
is closed at time f=0. Just
afterwards, what are (a) i), (b) i,
(c) the current is through the switch,
(d) the potential difference V,
across resistor 2, (e) the potential
difference V, across the inductor,
and (f) the rate of change di,/dt? A
long time later, what are (g) i), (h) i,
(i) ig, (j) Vas (k) V;,and (1) di,/dt?

80 In Fig. 30-63, R = 4.0kQ, L = 8.0 wH, and the ideal battery
has € = 20 V. How long after switch S is closed is the current
2.0mA?
