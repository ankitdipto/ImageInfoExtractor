The table also shows, in the second energy column, the two kinds of energy
involved in LC oscillations. By looking across the table, we can see an analogy
between the forms of the two pairs of energies—the mechanical energies of the
block—spring system and the electromagnetic energies of the LC oscillator. The
equations for v and iat the bottom of the table help us see the details of the analogy.
They tell us that g corresponds to x and i corresponds to v (in both equations, the
former is differentiated to obtain the latter). These correspondences then suggest
that, in the energy expressions, 1/C corresponds to k and L corresponds to m.Thus,

q corresponds to x, 1/C corresponds to k,
icorrespondstov, and L corresponds tom.

These correspondences suggest that in an LC oscillator, the capacitor is mathemat-
ically like the spring in a block—spring system and the inductor is like the block.

In Module 15-1 we saw that the angular frequency of oscillation of a (fric-
tionless) block—spring system is

on |& (block—spring system). (31-3)
m

The correspondences listed above suggest that to find the angular frequency of
oscillation for an ideal (resistanceless) LC circuit, k should be replaced by 1/C
and m by L, yielding

w=

se (LC circuit). (31-4)

LC Oscillations, Quantitatively

Here we want to show explicitly that Eq. 314 for the angular frequency of LC
oscillations is correct. At the same time, we want to examine even more closely the
analogy between LC oscillations and block—spring oscillations. We start by extend-
ing somewhat our earlier treatment of the mechanical block —spring oscillator.

The Block-Spring Oscillator
We analyzed block-spring oscillations in Chapter 15 in terms of energy transfers
and did not—at that early stage—derive the fundamental differential equation
that governs those oscillations. We do so now.

We can write, for the total energy U of a block—spring oscillator at any instant,

U =U, + U, = 3m? + $k, (31-5)

where U, and U, are, respectively, the kinetic energy of the moving block and the
potential energy of the stretched or compressed spring. If there is no friction—
which we assume —the total energy U remains constant with time, even though
v and x vary. In more formal language, dU/dt = 0. This leads to

Wd nos tpn) pv py BE
de dt (jmv? + 5kx*) = mv at + kx di =0. (31-6)
Substituting v = dx/dt and dv/dt = d?x/dt*,we find
ax
ma + kx =0  (block-spring oscillations). (31-7)

Equation 31-7 is the fundamental differential equation that governs the friction-
less block—spring oscillations.
The general solution to Eq. 31-7 is (as we saw in Eq. 15-3)

x = Xcos(wt + f) (displacement), (31-8)
