Canceling Q cos(wt + #) and rearranging lead to

Thus, Eq. 31-12 is indeed a solution of Eq. 31-11 if w has the constant value
1/VLC. Note that this expression for w is exactly that given by Eq. 31-4.

The phase constant ¢ in Eq. 31-12 is determined by the conditions that exist
at any certain time—-say, t = 0. If the conditions yield ¢ = 0 at t = 0, Eq. 31-12
requires that g = Q and Eq. 31-13 requires that i = 0; these are the initial con-

ditions represented by Fig. 31-la.

Iv] Checkpoint 2

A capacitor in an LC oscillator has a maximum potential difference of 17 V anda
maximum energy of 160 J. When the capacitor has a potential difference of 5 V and
an energy of 10 J, what are (a) the emf across the inductor and (b) the energy stored

in the magnetic field?

Sample Problem 31.01 LC oscillator: potential change, rate of current change

A 1.5 wF capacitor is charged to 57 V by a battery, which is
then removed. At time ¢ = 0,a 12 mH coil is connected in se-
ries with the capacitor to form an LC oscillator (Fig. 31-1).

(a) What is the potential difference v,(¢) across the inductor
as a function of time?

KEY IDEAS

(1) The current and potential differences of the circuit (both
the potential difference of the capacitor and the potential
difference of the coil) undergo sinusoidal oscillations.
(2) We can still apply the loop rule to these oscillating
potential differences, just as we did for the nonoscillating
circuits of Chapter 27.

Calculations: At any time t during the oscillations, the loop
rule and Fig. 31-1 give us
vit) = vel); (31-18)

that is, the potential difference v,; across the inductor must
always be equal to the potential difference vc across the
capacitor, so that the net potential difference around the
circuit is zero. Thus, we will find v;(t) if we can find v¢(t),
and we can find v¢(¢) from q(t) with Eq. 25-1 (q = CV).

Because the potential difference vc(t) is maximum
when the oscillations begin at time t = 0, the charge q on the
capacitor must also be maximum then. Thus, phase constant
must be zero; so Eq. 31-12 gives us

q = Qcos at. (31-19)
