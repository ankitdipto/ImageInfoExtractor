(Note that this cosine function does indeed yield maximum
q (= Q) when t = 0.) To get the potential difference v(t),
we divide both sides of Eq. 31-19 by C to write

q_Q

C= EOS

and then use Eq. 25-1 to write
vc = Ve cos wt. (31-20)

Here, Vc is the amplitude of the oscillations in the potential
difference vc across the capacitor.
Next, substituting ve = vz, from Eq. 31-18, we find

vy = Ve cos at. (31-21)

‘We can evaluate the right side of this equation by first not-
ing that the amplitude V¢ is equal to the initial (maximum)
potential difference of 57 V across the capacitor. Then we
find with Eq. 31-4:

°~ TEC ~ [(0.012 H)(.5 x 10°F)

= 7454 rad/s ~ 7500 rad/s.
Thus, Eq. 31-21 becomes

vy = (57 V) cos(7500 rad/s)t. (Answer)

(b) What is the maximum rate (di/dt) »,, at which the current
ichanges in the circuit?

KEY IDEA

 

With the charge on the capacitor oscillating as in Eq. 31-12,
the current is in the form of Eq. 31-13. Because ¢ = 0, that
equation gives us

i= —wQsin at.
Calculations: Taking the derivative, we have

‘We can simplify this equation by substituting CV¢ for Q
(because we know C and V¢ but not Q) and 1/\V/LC for w
according to Eq. 31-4. We get

This tells us that the current changes at a varying (sinu-
soidal) rate, with its maximum rate of change being

31-2 DAMPED OSCILLATIONS IN AN RLC CIRCUIT

Learning Objectives

 

After reading this module, you should be able to...

31.13 Draw the schematic of a damped RLC circuit and
explain why the oscillations are damped.

31.14 Starting with the expressions for the field energies
and the rate of energy loss in a damped RLC circuit,
write the differential equation for the charge q on the
capacitor.

31.15 For adamped RLC circuit, apply the expression for
charge q(t).

Key Ideas

@ Oscillations in an LC circuit are damped when a
dissipative element R is also present in the circuit.
Then

L

= + rat + aa = 0  (RLC circuit).

31.16 Identify that in a damped RLC circuit, the charge
amplitude and the amplitude of the electric field energy
decrease exponentially with time.

31.17 Apply the relationship between the angular frequency
a! of agiven damped RLC oscillator and the angular
frequency w of the circuit if R is removed.

31.18 Fora damped RLC circuit, apply the expression for
the electric field energy U; as a function of time.

@ The solution of this differential equation is
gq = Oe ®! cos(w't + $),
wo! = Ve — (RL).
We consider only situations with small R and thus small
damping; then w' ~ w.
