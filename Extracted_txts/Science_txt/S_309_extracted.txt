¢ There are three principal kinds of RNA: messenger
RNA (mRNA), transcripts of genes used to direct the
assembly of amino acids into proteins; ribosomal
RNA (rRNA), which combines with proteins to make
up the ribosomes that carry out the assembly process;
and transfer RNA (tRNA), molecules that transport
the amino acids to the ribosome for assembly into
proteins.

1, What are the three major
classes of RNA? What is the
function of each type?

2. What is the function of RNA
polymerase in transcription?
‘What determines where RNA
polymerase begins and ends its
function?

15.2 Genes encode information in three-nucleotide code words.

* The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes the
sequence of amino acids in proteins. The mRNA
transcribed from the DNA is read by ribosomes in
increments of three nucleotides called codons.

15.3. Genes are first transcribed, then translated.

3. How did Crick and his
colleagues determine how many
nucleotides are used to specify
each amino acid? What is an
anticodon?

* During transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase
manufactures mRNA molecules with nucleotide
sequences complementary to particular segments of
the DNA.

¢ During translation, the mRNA sequences direct the
assembly of amino acids into proteins on cytoplasmic
ribosomes.

¢ The information in a gene and in an mRNA molecule
is read in three-nucleotide blocks called codons.

* On the ribosome, the mRNA molecule is positioned
so that only one of its codons is exposed at any time.

¢ This exposure permits a tRNA molecule with the
complementary base sequence (anticodon) to bind to
it.

* Attached to the other end of the tRNA is an amino
acid, which is added to the end of the growing
polypeptide chain.

15.4 Eukaryotic gene transcripts are spliced.

4. During protein synthesis,
what mechanism ensures that
only one amino acid is added to
the growing polypeptide at a
time? What mechanism ensures
the correct amino acid is added
at each position in the
polypeptide?

5. How does an mRNA.
molecule specify where the
polypeptide it encodes should
begin? How does it specify
where the polypeptide should
end?

6. What roles do elongation
factors play in translation?

* Most eukaryotic genes contain noncoding sequences
(introns) interspersed randomly between coding
sequences (exons).

* The portions of an mRNA molecule corresponding
to the introns are removed from the primary RNA
transcript before the remainder is translated.

7, What is an intron? What is an
exon? How is each involved in
the mRNA molecule that is
ultimately translated?
