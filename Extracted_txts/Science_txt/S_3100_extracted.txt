31-2 DAMPED OSCILLATIONS IN AN RLC CIRCUIT 911

Damped Oscillations in an RLE Circuit

A circuit containing resistance, inductance, and capacitance is called an RLC
circuit. We shall here discuss only series RLC circuits like that shown in Fig. 31-5.
With a resistance R present, the total electromagnetic energy U of the circuit (the
sum of the electrical energy and magnetic energy) is no longer constant; instead,
it decreases with time as energy is transferred to thermal energy in the resistance.
Because of this loss of energy, the oscillations of charge, current, and potential
difference continuously decrease in amplitude, and the oscillations are said to be
damped, just as with the damped block -spring oscillator of Module 15-5.

To analyze the oscillations of this circuit, we write an equation for the total
electromagnetic energy U in the circuit at any instant. Because the resistance
does not store electromagnetic energy, we can use Eq. 31-9:

U =U, + Up = >- +5.

Now, however, this total energy decreases as energy is transferred to thermal
energy. The rate of that transfer is, from Eq. 26-27,
dU _

where the minus sign indicates that U decreases. By differentiating Eq. 31-22 with
respect to time and then substituting the result in Eq. 31-23, we obtain

in which

where = 1/\VLC, as with an undamped oscillator. Equation 31-25 tells us how
the charge on the capacitor oscillates in a damped RLC circuit; that equation is
the electromagnetic counterpart of Eq. 15-42, which gives the displacement of
a damped block-spring oscillator.

Equation 31-25 describes a sinusoidal oscillation (the cosine function) with
an exponentially decaying amplitude Qe-®'*" (the factor that multiplies the
cosine). The angular frequency w’ of the damped oscillations is always less than
the angular frequency w of the undamped oscillations; however, we shall here
consider only situations in which R is small enough for us to replace w’ with w.

Energy Decay. Let us next find an expression for the total electromagnetic
energy U of the circuit as a function of time. One way to do so is to monitor
the energy of the electric field in the capacitor, which is given by Eq. 31-1
(Ug = q7/2C). By substituting Eq. 31-25 into Eq. 31-1, we obtain

Thus, the energy of the electric field oscillates according to a cosine-squared
term, and the amplitude of that oscillation decreases exponentially with time.

charge contained in the circuit oscillates
back and forth through the resistance,
electromagnetic energy is dissipated as
thermal energy, damping (decreasing the
amplitude of) the oscillations.
