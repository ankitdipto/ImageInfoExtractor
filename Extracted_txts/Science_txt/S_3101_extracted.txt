ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

Sample Problem 31.02 Damped RLC circuit: charge amplitude

A series RLC circuit has inductance L = 12 mH, capaci-
tance C = 1.6 uF, and resistance R = 1.5 © and begins to
oscillate at time t = 0.

(a) At what time ¢ will the amplitude of the charge oscilla-
tions in the circuit be 50% of its initial value? (Note that we
do not know that initial value.)

KEY IDEA

The amplitude of the charge oscillations decreases expo-
nentially with time t: According to Eq. 31-25, the charge
amplitude at any time tis Qe *"+, in which Q is the ampli-
tude at time ¢ = 0.

Calculations: We want the time when the charge amplitude
has decreased to 0.50Q— that is, when

Qe-Ri2 — 0,500.

‘We can now cancel Q (which also means that we can answer
the question without knowing the initial charge). Taking the
natural logarithms of both sides (to eliminate the exponen-
tial function), we have

Solving for t and then substituting given data yield

(b) How many oscillations are completed within this time?
KEY IDEA

The time for one complete oscillation is the period T=
27/w, where the angular frequency for LC oscillations is
given by Eq. 31-4(@ = 1/VLC).

Calculation: In the time interval At = 0.0111 s, the number
of complete oscillations is

(Answer)

Thus, the amplitude decays by 50% in about 13 complete
oscillations. This damping is less severe than that shown in
Fig. 31-3, where the amplitude decays by a little more than
50% in one oscillation.

angular frequency w.

31.24 In adriven (series) RLC circuit, identify the conditions

31.25 For each of the three basic circuits (purely resistive
load, purely capacitive load, and purely inductive load),

draw the circuit and sketch graphs and phasor diagrams
for voltage v(t) and current i(t).

v(t) and current i(¢).

31.27 On a phasor diagram for each of the basic circuits,
identify angular speed, amplitude, projection on the verti-
cal axis, and rotation angle.

31.28 For each basic circuit, identify the phase constant, and
interpret it in terms of the relative orientations of the cur-
rent phasor and voltage phasor and also in terms of lead-
ing and lagging.
