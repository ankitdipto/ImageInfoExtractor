ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

alternating quantity at time ¢. In Fig. 31-9b, the voltage and current are in
phase; so their phasors always have the same phase w,t and the same rotation
angle, and thus they rotate together.

Mentally follow the rotation. Can you see that when the phasors have
rotated so that w,t = 90° (they point vertically upward), they indicate that just
then vy = Veand ig = Jp? Equations 31-30 and 31-32 give the same results.

If we increase the driving frequency in a circuit with a purely resistive load, do
(a) amplitude Vg and (b) amplitude Jy increase, decrease, or remain the same?

Sample Problem 31.03 Purely resistive load: potential difference and current

In Fig. 31-8, resistance R is 200 © and the sinusoidal alter-
nating emf device operates at amplitude ©,, = 36.0 V and
frequency f;, = 60.0 Hz.

(a) What is the potential difference v,(t) across the resistance
as a function of time ¢, and what is the amplitude Vp of va(t)?

KEY IDEA

In a circuit with a purely resistive load, the potential differ-
ence v,(f) across the resistance is always equal to the potential
difference €(t) across the emf device.

Calculations: For our situation, va(t) = €(t) and Vz = €,,.
Since @,,, is given, we can write

Vr = Em = 36.0 V. (Answer)
To find va(t), we use Eq. 31-28 to write
va(t) = E(t) = €,, sin wat (31-34)
and then substitute €,,, = 36.0 V and
oy = 27fy = 2n(60 Hz) = 1207
to obtain
vp = (36.0 V) sin(120zt). (Answer)

A Capacitive Load

‘We can leave the argument of the sine in this form for con-
venience, or we can write it as (377 rad/s)t or as (377 st.

(b) What are the current i,(t) in the resistance and the
amplitude [p of ig(t)?

KEY IDEA

 

In an ac circuit with a purely resistive load, the alternating
current ig(f) in the resistance is in phase with the alternating
potential difference v,(t) across the resistance; that is, the
phase constant ¢ for the current is zero.

Calculations: Here we can write Eq. 31-29 as

 

ig = Ip sin(wgt — ) = Ip sin wat. (31-35)
From Eq. 31-33, the amplitude Jp is
_ Ve _ 36.0V _

Tp = R 2000 ~ 0.180 A. (Answer)

Substituting this and w,; = 2afj, = 1207 into Eq. 31-35, we
have

ip = (0.180 A) sin(120zt). (Answer)

Figure 31-10 A capacitor is connected across
an alternating-current generator.

Figure 31-10 shows a circuit containing a capacitance and a generator with the
alternating emf of Eq. 31-28. Using the loop rule and proceeding as we did when
we obtained Eq. 31-30, we find that the potential difference across the capacitor is

(31-36)

where V¢ is the amplitude of the alternating voltage across the capacitor. From
the definition of capacitance we can also write

Ve = Vesin wat,

dc = Cve = CVesin wgt. (31-37)

Our concern, however, is with the current rather than the charge. Thus, we differ-
