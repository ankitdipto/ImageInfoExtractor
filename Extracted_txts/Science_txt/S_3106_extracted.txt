31-3 FORCED OSCILLATIONS OF THREE SIMPLE CIRCUITS 917

entiate Eq. 31-37 to find

We now modify Eq. 31-38 in two ways. First, for reasons of symmetry of nota-
tion, we introduce the quantity X¢, called the capacitive reactance of a capacitor,
defined as

Xc = — > (capacitive reactance). (31-39)
aC

Its value depends not only on the capacitance but also on the driving angular

frequency w,. We know from the definition of the capacitive time constant

(7 = RC) that the SI unit for C can be expressed as seconds per ohm. Applying

this to Eq. 31-39 shows that the SI unit of X¢ is the ohm, just as for resistance R.
Second, we replace cos w,t in Eq. 31-38 with a phase-shifted sine:

COS wyt = sin(wgt + 90°).

You can verify this identity by shifting a sine curve 90° in the negative direction.
With these two modifications, Eq. 31-38 becomes

ve
ig = (#) sin(w,t + 90°). (31-40)

From Eq. 31-29, we can also write the current ic in the capacitor of Fig. 31-10 as
ic = Icsin(wyt — 4), (31-41)

where Jc is the amplitude of ic. Comparing Eqs. 31-40 and 31-41, we see that for
a purely capacitive load the phase constant ¢ for the current is —90°. We also
see that the voltage amplitude and current amplitude are related by

Ve=IcXc (capacitor). (31-42)

Although we found this relation for the circuit of Fig. 31-10, it applies to any
capacitance in any ac circuit.

Comparison of Eqs. 31-36 and 31-40, or inspection of Fig. 31-11a, shows that
the quantities ve and i¢ are 90°, 7/2 rad, or one-quarter cycle, out of phase.
Furthermore, we see that ic /eads vc, which means that, if you monitored the
current ic and the potential difference v¢ in the circuit of Fig. 31-10, you would
find that ic reaches its maximum before vc does, by one-quarter cycle.

For a capacitive load, the

current leads the potential

difference by 90°.
