ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

This relation between ic and v¢ is illustrated by the phasor diagram of
Fig. 31-11b. As the phasors representing these two quantities rotate counterclock-
wise together, the phasor labeled J¢ does indeed lead that labeled V¢, and by an
angle of 90°; that is, the phasor J¢ coincides with the vertical axis one-quarter
cycle before the phasor V¢ does. Be sure to convince yourself that the phasor
diagram of Fig. 31-110 is consistent with Eqs. 31-36 and 31-40.

lv] Checkpoint 4

The figure shows, in (a),a sine curve S(t) = sin(«,f) and three
other sinusoidal curves A(s), B(0), and C(1), each of the form
sin(w,t — 4). (a) Rank the three other curves according to the
value of 4,most positive first and most negative last. (b) Which
curve corresponds to which phasor in (6) of the figure? (c)
Which curve leads the others?

 

 

Sample Problem 31.04 Purely capacitive load: potential difference and current

In Fig. 31-10, capacitance C is 15.0 wF and the sinusoidal
alternating emf device operates at amplitude ©,, = 36.0 V
and frequency f, = 60.0 Hz.

(a) What are the potential difference v¢(t) across the
capacitance and the amplitude V¢ of vc(t)?

KEY IDEA

 

In a circuit with a purely capacitive load, the potential dif-
ference v¢(t) across the capacitance is always equal to the
potential difference €(t) across the emf device.

Calculations: Here we have vc(t) =€(t) and Vo= €p.
Since @,,, is given, we have

Ve = Em = 36.0 V. (Answer)
To find v(t), we use Eq. 31-28 to write
vc(t) = E(t) = €,, sin egt. (31-43)

Then, substituting €,, = 36.0 V and w, = 27f,; = 1207 into
Eq. 31-43, we have

Ve = (36.0 V) sin(120 zt). (Answer)
(b) What are the current i¢(¢) in the circuit as a function of

time and the amplitude J¢ of ic(t)?

KEY IDEA

 

In an ac circuit with a purely capacitive load, the alternating
current i¢(#) in the capacitance leads the alternating poten-
tial difference v¢(t) by 90°; that is, the phase constant ¢ for
the current is —90°, or — w/2 rad.

Calculations: Thus, we can write Eq. 31-29 as
ic = Icsin(w,t — 6) = Ic sin(ayt + 72). (31-44)

We can find the amplitude J; from Eq. 31-42 (Ve = I¢X¢) if
we first find the capacitive reactance X¢. From Eq. 31-39
(X¢ = Va C), with w; = 27f;, we can write

 

1 i
a
© 2nfiC —— (277)(60.0 Hz)(15.0 X 10° F)
=1779.
Then Eq. 31-42 tells us that the current amplitude is
— Ve _ 360V _
Ic= Xo 170 > 0.203 A. (Answer)

Substituting this and w, = 27fj = 1207 into Eq. 31-44, we
have

ic = (0.203 A) sin(120zt + 7/2). (Answer)

An Inductive Load

 

Figure 31-12 An inductor is connected across
an alternating-current generator.

Figure 31-12 shows a circuit containing an inductance and a generator with the al-
ternating emf of Eq. 31-28. Using the loop rule and proceeding as we did to
obtain Eq. 31-30, we find that the potential difference across the inductance is

v= Vz sin ayt, (31-45)
