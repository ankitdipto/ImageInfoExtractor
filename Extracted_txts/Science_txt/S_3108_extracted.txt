31-3 FORCED OSCILLATIONS OF THREE SIMPLE CIRCUITS 919

where V, is the amplitude of v,. From Eq. 30-35 (€, = —L di/dt), we can write
the potential difference across an inductance L in which the current is changing

at the rate di,/dt as

v= Loa (31-46)
If we combine Eqs. 31-45 and 31-46, we have

Our concern, however, is with the current, so we integrate:
V, V,
i, = [aw 7 4 | sin yt dt = -( £ ) os cyt. (31-48)

We now modify this equation in two ways. First, for reasons of symmetry of
notation, we introduce the quantity X7, called the inductive reactance of an
inductor, which is defined as

X_, = wal (inductive reactance). (31-49)

The value of X;, depends on the driving angular frequency w,. The unit of the
inductive time constant 7, indicates that the SI unit of X;, is the ohm, just as it is
for Xcand for R.

Second, we replace —cos w,t in Eq.31-48 with a phase-shifted sine:

CoS wyt = sin(wgt — 90°).

You can verify this identity by shifting a sine curve 90° in the positive direction.
With these two changes, Eq. 31-48 becomes

Vi
i, = (#4) sin(w,t — 90°). (31-50)

From Eq. 31-29, we can also write this current in the inductance as
i, = I, sin(wyt — 4), (31-51)

where J, is the amplitude of the current i,. Comparing Eqs. 31-50 and 31-51, we
see that for a purely inductive load the phase constant ¢ for the current is +90°.
We also see that the voltage amplitude and current amplitude are related by

V,=1,X_ (inductor). (31-52)

Although we found this relation for the circuit of Fig. 31-12, it applies to any
inductance in any ac circuit.

Comparison of Eqs. 31-45 and 31-50, or inspection of Fig. 31-13a, shows
that the quantities i, and v, are 90° out of phase. In this case, however, i; lags
v,; that is, monitoring the current i, and the potential difference v, in the cir-
cuit of Fig. 31-12 shows that i, reaches its maximum value after v; does, by
one-quarter cycle. The phasor diagram of Fig. 31-135 also contains this informa-
tion. As the phasors rotate counterclockwise in the figure, the phasor labeled J;,
does indeed lag that labeled V;, and by an angle of 90°. Be sure to convince your-
self that Fig. 31-13b represents Eqs. 31-45 and 31-50.

If we increase the driving frequency in a circuit with a purely capacitive load, do
(a) amplitude V¢ and (b) amplitude /¢ increase, decrease, or remain the same? If,
instead, the circuit has a purely inductive load, do (c) amplitude V; and (d) amplitude
I, increase, decrease, or remain the same?

For an inductive load,
the current lags the
potential difference
by 90°.
