Problem-Solving Tactics

Leading and Lagging in AC Circuits: Table 31-2 summa-
rizes the relations between the current i and the voltage v
for each of the three kinds of circuit elements we have con-
sidered. When an applied alternating voltage produces an
alternating current in these elements, the current is always
in phase with the voltage across a resistor, always leads the
voltage across a capacitor, and always lags the voltage
across an inductor.

Many students remember these results with the
mnemonic “ELI the ICE man.” ELI contains the letter L

ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

(for inductor), and in it the letter J (for current) comes after
the letter E (for emf or voltage). Thus, for an inductor, the
current /ags (comes after) the voltage. Similarly, JCE (which
contains a C for capacitor) means that the current leads
(comes before) the voltage. You might also use the modified
mnemonic “ELI positively is the ICE man” to remember
that the phase constant ¢is positive for an inductor.

Tf you have difficulty in remembering whether X¢ is
equal to wsC (wrong) or 1/a,C (right), try remembering that
C isin the “cellar” —that is, in the denominator.

Sample Problem 31.05 Purely inductive load: potential difference and current

In Fig. 31-12, inductance L is 230 mH and the sinusoidal
alternating emf device operates at amplitude €,, = 36.0 V
and frequency f,, = 60.0 Hz.

(a) What are the potential difference v,(t) across the induc-
tance and the amplitude V;, of v,(t)?

KEY IDEA

 

Ina circuit with a purely inductive load, the potential differ-
ence v,(t) across the inductance is always equal to the
potential difference €(t) across the emf device.

Calculations: Here we have v,(t) = €(t) and V;=€,.
Since @,,, is given, we know that

Vi = €m = 36.0 V. (Answer)
To find v,(t),we use Eq. 31-28 to write
vz(t) = €(t) = €,, sin egt. (31-53)

Then, substituting €,, = 36.0 V and w, = 27f, = 1207 into
Eg. 31-53, we have
vy = (36.0 V) sin(12077). (Answer)

(b) What are the current i,(¢) in the circuit as a function of
time and the amplitude J; of i,(t)?

KEY IDEA

 

In an ac circuit with a purely inductive load, the alternating
current i,(t) in the inductance lags the alternating potential
difference v,(t) by 90°. (In the mnemonic of the problem-
solving tactic, this circuit is “positively an ELI circuit,”
which tells us that the emf E leads the current J and that ¢ is
positive.)

Calculations: Because the phase constant ¢ for the
current is +90°, or + 7/2 rad, we can write Eq. 31-29 as

i, = I, sin(@jt — $) = I, sin(wyt — 72). (31-54)
We can find the amplitude /;, from Eq. 31-52 (V;, = IX) if

we first find the inductive reactance X;. From Eq. 31-49
(X_,, = gL), with wy = 27f, we can write

X, = 2mfyL = (277)(60.0 Hz)(230 x 10-3 H)

 

= 86.70.
Then Eq. 31-52 tells us that the current amplitude is
_M _ 360V _
= X, 7 8670 > 0.415 A. (Answer)

Substituting this and w,; = 2afj = 1207 into Eq. 31-54, we
have

i, = (0.415 A) sin(120at — 7/2). (Answer)
