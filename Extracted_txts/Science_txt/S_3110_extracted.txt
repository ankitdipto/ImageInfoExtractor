@ The current amplitude J is maximum (J = €,,,/R) when the

driving angular frequency «, equals the natural angular fre-

quency w of the circuit, a condition known as resonance. Then

Xc = X_, ¢ = 0, and the current is in phase with the emf.

The Series ALC Circuit

We are now ready to apply the alternating emf of Eq. 31-28,
€ =€,,Sin wyt (appliedemf), (31-55)

to the full RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7. Because R, L, and C are in series, the same
current

i= Isin(wyt — 6) (31-56)

is driven in all three of them. We wish to find the current amplitude J and the
phase constant ¢ and to investigate how these quantities depend on the driving
angular frequency w,. The solution is simplified by the use of phasor diagrams as
introduced for the three basic circuits of Module 31-3: capacitive load, inductive
load, and resistive load. In particular we shall make use of how the voltage phasor
is related to the current phasor for each of those basic circuits. We shall find that
series RLC circuits can be separated into three types: mainly capacitive circuits,
mainly inductive circuits, and circuits that are in resonance.
