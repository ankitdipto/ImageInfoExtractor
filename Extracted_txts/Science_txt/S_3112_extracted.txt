31-4 THE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT

Both triangles in Fig. 31-14d are right triangles. Applying the Pythagorean
theorem to either one yields

€2,=Vat+ (Vi - Vey. 31-58
m R L G

From the voltage amplitude information displayed in the rightmost column of
Table 31-2, we can rewrite this as

€3, = (RY + UX, - 1X)’, (31-59)

and then rearrange it to the form
En
VR? + (X, = Xo
The denominator in Eq. 31-60 is called the impedance Z of the circuit for the
driving angular frequency 4:

Z = VR? + (X, — Xc)? (impedance defined). (31-61)

We can then write Eq. 31-60 as

I= (31-60)

Em
I= Zz (31-62)
If we substitute for X¢ and X;,, from Egs. 31-39 and 31-49, we can write
Eq. 31-60 more explicitly as
Em .
f= ————#*#—— __ (carrent amplitude). (31-63)
VR? + (wy — VegC)

We have now accomplished half our goal: We have obtained an expression
for the current amplitude / in terms of the sinusoidal driving emf and the circuit
elements in a series RLC circuit.

The value of J depends on the difference between w,L and 1/a,yC in
Eg. 31-63 or, equivalently, the difference between X, and X¢ in Eq. 31-60. In
either equation, it does not matter which of the two quantities is greater because
the difference is always squared.

The current that we have been describing in this module is the steady-state
current that occurs after the alternating emf has been applied for some
time. When the emf is first applied to a circuit, a brief transient current
occurs. Its duration (before settling down into the steady-state current) is
determined by the time constants 7; = L/R and tc = RC as the inductive and
capacitive elements “turn on.” This transient current can, for example, destroy
a motor on start-up if it is not properly taken into account in the motor’s
circuit design.

The Phase Constant

From the right-hand phasor triangle in Fig. 31-14d and from Table 31-2 we can
write

Vi- Ve _ IX, — 1X

tang = Ve TR

(31-64)
which gives us

Xe

tan ¢ = 2 (phase constant). (31-65)

 

This is the other half of our goal: an equation for the phase constant ¢ in the si-
nusoidally driven series RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7. In essence, it gives us three dif-
