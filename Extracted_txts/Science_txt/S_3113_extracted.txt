Figure 31-15 Phasor diagrams and
graphs of the alternating emf and
current i for the driven RLC circuit
of Fig, 31-7. In the phasor diagram of
(a) and the graph of (b), the current
lags the driving emf € and the cur-
rent’s phase constant ¢ is positive. In
(c) and (d), the current i leads the
driving emf and its phase constant
is negative. In (e) and (f), the cur-
rent is in phase with the driving emf
‘€ and its phase constant ¢ is zero.

ferent results for the phase constant, depending on the relative values of the
reactances X; and X¢:

X,, > X¢: The circuit is said to be more inductive than capacitive. Equation 31-65
tells us that ¢ is positive for such a circuit, which means that phasor J rotates
behind phasor €,, (Fig. 31-15a). A plot of € and i versus time is like that in
Fig. 31-15b. (Figures 31-14c and d were drawn assuming X;, > X¢.)

X¢ > X,: The circuit is said to be more capacitive than inductive. Equation 31-65
tells us that ¢is negative for such a circuit, which means that phasor J rotates
ahead of phasor €,,, (Fig. 31-15c). A plot of € and i versus time is like that in
Fig. 31-15d.

Xc = X,: The circuit is said to be in resonance, a state that is discussed next.
Equation 31-65 tells us that ¢ = 0° for such a circuit, which means that phasors
€, and J rotate together (Fig. 31-15e). A plot of € and i versus time is like that
in Fig. 31-15f.

As illustration, let us reconsider two extreme circuits: In the purely inductive
circuit of Fig. 31-12, where X;, is nonzero and X¢ = R = 0, Eq. 31-65 tells us that
the circuit’s phase constant is ¢ = +90° (the greatest value of ¢), consistent with
Fig. 31-13b. In the purely capacitive circuit of Fig. 31-10, where X¢ is nonzero and
X,, = R = 0, Eq. 31-65 tells us that the circuit’s phase constant is 6 = —90° (the
least value of #), consistent with Fig. 31-11.

Resonance

Equation 31-63 gives the current amplitude J in an RLC circuit as a function of
the driving angular frequency w, of the external alternating emf. For a given
resistance R, that amplitude is a maximum when the quantity w,L — 1/a,C in the
