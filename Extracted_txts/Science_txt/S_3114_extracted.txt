Because the natural angular frequency w of the RLC circuit is also equal to
1/VLC, the maximum value of J occurs when the driving angular frequency
matches the natural angular frequency —that is, at resonance. Thus, in an RLC
circuit, resonance and maximum current amplitude J occur when

Resonance Curves. Figure 31-16 shows three resonance curves for sinu-
soidally driven oscillations in three series RLC circuits differing only in R. Each
curve peaks at its maximum current amplitude J when the ratio w,/wis 1.00, but
the maximum value of J decreases with increasing R. (The maximum J is always
Em/R; to see why, combine Eqs. 31-61 and 31-62.) In addition, the curves in-
crease in width (measured in Fig. 31-16 at half the maximum value of J) with
increasing R.
