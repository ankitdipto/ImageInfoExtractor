CHAPTER 31

ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

To make physical sense of Fig. 31-16, consider how the reactances X;, and
X¢ change as we increase the driving angular frequency w,, starting with a value
much less than the natural frequency w. For small @,, reactance X;, (= w,L) is
small and reactance X¢ (= 1/a,C) is large. Thus, the circuit is mainly capacitive
and the impedance is dominated by the large X¢, which keeps the current low.

As we increase w,, reactance X¢ remains dominant but decreases while reac-
tance X;, increases. The decrease in X¢ decreases the impedance, allowing the
current to increase, as we see on the left side of any resonance curve in Fig. 31-16.
When the increasing X;, and the decreasing X¢ reach equal values, the current is
greatest and the circuit is in resonance, with wy = w.

As we continue to increase w,, the increasing reactance X;, becomes pro-
gressively more dominant over the decreasing reactance X¢. The impedance
increases because of X;, and the current decreases, as on the right side of any
resonance curve in Fig. 31-16. In summary, then: The low-angular-frequency side
of a resonance curve is dominated by the capacitor’s reactance, the high-angular-
frequency side is dominated by the inductor’s reactance, and resonance occurs in
the middle.

Here are the capacitive reactance and inductive reactance, respectively, for three
sinusoidally driven series RLC circuits: (1) 50 Q, 100.0; (2) 100.0, 50 0; (3) 50 0,50 2.
(a) For each, does the current lead or lag the applied emf, or are the two in phase?

(b) Which circuit is in resonance?

Sample Problem 31.06 Current amplitude, impedance, and phase constant

In Fig. 31-7, let R=200 0, C= 15.0 uF L =230 mH,
fa = 60.0 Hz, and €,, = 36.0 V. (These parameters are those
used in the earlier sample problems.)

(a) What is the current amplitude /?

KEY IDEA

 

The current amplitude J depends on the amplitude ©,,, of the
driving emf and on the impedance Z of the circuit, accord-
ing to Eq. 31-62 (I = €,,/Z).

Calculations: So, we need to find Z, which depends on resis-
tance R, capacitive reactance X¢, and inductive reactance X7.
The circuit’s resistance is the given resistance R. Its capacitive
reactance is due to the given capacitance and, from an earlier
sample problem, X¢ = 177 ©. Its inductive reactance is due
to the given inductance and, from another sample problem,
X, = 86.7 ©. Thus, the circuit’s impedance is

Z = VR? + (X, — XP
= V(2000Y + (867.0 — 1770)

= 2199.

We then find

T= Em _ 36.0V

— Z 2190

(b) What is the phase constant ¢ of the current in the
circuit relative to the driving emf?

 

 

= 0.164 A. (Answer)

KEY IDEA

The phase constant depends on the inductive reactance, the
capacitive reactance, and the resistance of the circuit,
according to Eq. 31-65.

Calculation: Solving Eq.31-65 for leads to
aXe _, 8670-1770

al
= tan 200.2

= tan

= —24.3° = —0.424 rad. (Answer)

The negative phase constant is consistent with the fact that
the load is mainly capacitive; that is, ¥- > X,. In the com-
mon mnemonic for driven series RLC circuits, this circuit is
an ICE circuit —the current leads the driving emf.
