Key Ideas
e@ In aseries RLC circuit, the average power P.yy of the
generator is equal to the production rate of thermal energy in
the resistor:

Payg = Tims = Ermslems COS .

31.45 Fora driven RLC circuit in steady state, explain what
happens to (a) the value of the average stored energy with
time and (b) the energy that the generator puts into the
circuit.

31.46 Apply the relationship between the power factor cos ¢,
the resistance R, and the impedance Z.

31.47 Apply the relationship between the average power
Pag, the rms emf Ems, the rms current L;ms, and the power
factor cos ¢.

31.48 Identify what power factor is required in order to maxi-
mize the rate at which energy is supplied to a resistive load.

@ The abbreviation rms stands for root-mean-square; the
ms quantities are related to the maximum quantities by
Togs = HV2, Veg, = VIV2, and Eens = Em! V2. The term
cos ¢is called the power factor of the circuit.

 

Power in Alternating-Current Circuits

In the RLC circuit of Fig. 31-7, the source of energy is the alternating-current
generator. Some of the energy that it provides is stored in the electric field in the
capacitor, some is stored in the magnetic field in the inductor, and some is dis-
sipated as thermal energy in the resistor. In steady-state operation, the average
stored energy remains constant. The net transfer of energy is thus from the gener-
ator to the resistor, where energy is dissipated.

The instantaneous rate at which energy is dissipated in the resistor can be
written, with the help of Eqs. 26-27 and 31-29,as

P=?R = [Isin(wgt — 6) PR = PR sin(wgt — 4). (31-68)

The average rate at which energy is dissipated in the resistor, however, is the aver-
age of Eq. 31-68 over time. Over one complete cycle, the average value of sin @,
where @ is any variable, is zero (Fig. 31-17a) but the average value of sin? @ is 3
(Fig. 31-17b). (Note in Fig. 31-17b how the shaded areas under the curve but
above the horizontal line marked +4 exactly fill in the unshaded spaces below
that line.) Thus, we can write, from Eq. 31-68,

-#-( yr
wo 2 Va .

The quantity J/V2 is called the root-mean-square, or rms, value of the current i:

‘We can now rewrite Eq. 31-69 as
Pyg = TimsR (average power). (31-71)
