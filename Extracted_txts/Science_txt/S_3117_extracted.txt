CHAPTER 31

ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

Equation 31-71 has the same mathematical form as Eq. 26-27 (P = ?R); the
message here is that if we switch to the rms current, we can compute the aver-
age rate of energy dissipation for alternating-current circuits just as for direct-
current circuits.

We can also define rms values of voltages and emfs for alternating-current
circuits:

Vv @
Vems =—e and Ems = — (rms voltage;rmsemf). (31-72)

v2 v2

Alternating-current instruments, such as ammeters and voltmeters, are usually
calibrated to read Ipms, Vems» ANd Ems. Thus, if you plug an alternating-current
voltmeter into a household electrical outlet and it reads 120 V, that is an rms
voltage. The maximum value of the potential difference at the outlet is
V2 X (120 V), or 170 V. Generally scientists and engineers report rms values in-
stead of maximum values.

Because the proportionality factor 1/\/2 in Eqs. 31-70 and 31-72 is the same
for all three variables, we can write Eqs. 31-62 and 31-60 as

Igy = 8 = — bs (1-73)

Z VR + (X, — Xo)?"
and, indeed, this is the form that we almost always use.
We can use the relationship [jms = €;ms/Z to recast Eq. 31-71 in a useful
equivalent way. We write

 

Pag = 8 Lig = Crmslims = (31-74)

From Fig. 31-14d, Table 31-2, and Eq. 31-62, however, we see that R/Z is just the
cosine of the phase constant ¢:

Equation 31-74 then becomes
Pay = Ermstims COS P (average power), (31-76)

in which the term cos ¢ is called the power factor. Because cos ¢ = cos(—¢),
Eq. 31-76 is independent of the sign of the phase constant ¢.

To maximize the rate at which energy is supplied to a resistive load in an
RLC circuit, we should keep the power factor cos ¢ as close to unity as possible.
This is equivalent to keeping the phase constant ¢ in Eq. 31-29 as close to zero as
possible. If, for example, the circuit is highly inductive, it can be made less so by
putting more capacitance in the circuit, connected in series. (Recall that putting
an additional capacitance into a series of capacitances decreases the equivalent
capacitance C., of the series.) Thus, the resulting decrease in C,, in the circuit
reduces the phase constant and increases the power factor in Eq. 31-76. Power
companies place series-connected capacitors throughout their transmission sys-
tems to get these results.

(a) If the current ina sinusoidally driven series RLC circuit leads the emf, would we
increase or decrease the capacitance to increase the rate at which energy is supplied
to the resistance? (b) Would this change bring the resonant angular frequency of the
circuit closer to the angular frequency of the emf or put it farther away?
