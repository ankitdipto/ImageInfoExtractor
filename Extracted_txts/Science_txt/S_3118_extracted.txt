Sample Problem 31.07 Driven RLC circuit: power factor and average power

A series RLC circuit, driven with €,,,, = 120 V at fre-
quency f, = 60.0 Hz, contains a resistance R = 200 Q, an
inductance with inductive reactance X;, = 80.0 ©, and a
capacitance with capacitive reactance X¢ = 150.

(a) What are the power factor cos ¢ and phase constant ¢ of
the circuit?

KEY IDEA

The power factor cos ¢ can be found from the resistance R
and impedance Z via Eq. 31-75 (cos ¢ = R/Z).

Calculations: To calculate Z,we use Eq. 31-61:
Z = VR? + (X, — XoP
= V(200 OY + (80.0.0 — 150 HY = 211.900.

Equation 31-75 then gives us
R 2002

cos &= 7 = 911.900

Taking the inverse cosine then yields
= cos! 0.944 = +19.3°.

The inverse cosine on a calculator gives only the positive an-
swer here, but both +19.3° and —19.3° have a cosine of 0.944.
To determine which sign is correct, we must consider
whether the current leads or lags the driving emf. Because
X¢ > X;, this circuit is mainly capacitive, with the current
leading the emf. Thus, ¢ must be negative:

= —19.3°. (Answer)
We could, instead, have found ¢ with Eq. 31-65. A calculator
would then have given us the answer with the minus sign.

= 0.9438 ~ 0.944. (Answer)

(b) What is the average rate P,, at which energy is
dissipated in the resistance?

KEY IDEAS

There are two ways and two ideas to use: (1) Because the
circuit is assumed to be in steady-state operation, the rate at
which energy is dissipated in the resistance is equal to the
rate at which energy is supplied to the circuit, as given by
Eq. 31-76 (Pay = €rmslems COS #). (2) The rate at which
energy is dissipated in a resistance R depends on the square
of the rms current J,,,, through it, according to Eq. 31-71
(Pay = Pons R)-

First way: We are given the rms driving emf ©,,,, and we
already know cos ¢ from part (a). The rms current [jms is

determined by the rms value of the driving emf and the cir-
cuit’s impedance Z (which we know), according to Eq. 31-73:

Substituting this into Eq. 31-76 then leads to
2.
Pay = €rmstems COS & = Sens cos

Second way: Instead, we can write

= mw (200 2) = 64.1 W. A
11.90. 0F ( ) (Answer)

(c) What new capacitance C,.y, is needed to maximize Pay if
the other parameters of the circuit are not changed?

KEY IDEAS

(1) The average rate P,,. at which energy is supplied
and dissipated is maximized if the circuit is brought into
resonance with the driving emf. (2) Resonance occurs
when X¢ = X;.

Calculations: From the given data, we have X¢ > X_. Thus,
we must decrease X¢ to reach resonance. From Eq. 31-39
(Xc = I/a,C), we see that this means we must increase C to
the new value C,.y.
Using Eq. 31-39, we can write the resonance condition
Xc = Xp, as
1

=X,

Substituting 2 7f, for w, (because we are given f, and not «,)
and then solving for C,.w,we find
C.= to 1
A 2mfX, — (27)(60 Hz)(80.0 0)

= 3.32 x 10°F = 33.2 uF. (Answer)

Following the procedure of part (b), you can show that with
Crew, the average power of energy dissipation P,,y, would
then be at its maximum value of

Pyys,max = 72.0 W.
