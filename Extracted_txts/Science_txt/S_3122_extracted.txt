REVIEW & SUMMARY 933

Analternating-current emf device in a certain circuit has a smaller resistance than that
of the resistive load in the circuit;to increase the transfer of energy from the device to
the load, a transformer will be connected between the two. (a) Should N, be greater
than or less than N,? (b) Will that make it a step-up or step-down transformer?

Sample Problem 31.08 Transformer: turns ratio, average power, rms currents

A transformer on a utility pole operates at V, = 8.5kV on
the primary side and supplies electrical energy to a number
of nearby houses at V, = 120 V, both quantities being rms
values. Assume an ideal step-down transformer, a purely resis-
tive load, and a power factor of unity.

(a) What is the turns ratio N,/N, of the transformer?

KEY IDEA

 

The turns ratio N,/N, is related to the (given) rms primary
and secondary voltages via Eq. 31-79 (V, = V,N,/N,).

Calculation: We can write Eq. 31-79 as

ve _ iN
Gas, 31-83
Vp > Np (31-83)

(Note that the right side of this equation is the inverse of the
turns ratio.) Inverting both sides of Eq. 31-83 gives us

(b) The average rate of energy consumption (or dissipation) in
the houses served by the transformer is 78 kW. What are the rms
currents in the primary and secondary of the transformer?

KEY IDEA

For a purely resistive load, the power factor cos ¢ is unity; thus,
the average rate at which energy is supplied and dissipated is
given by Eq.31-77 (Pay = €1 = IV).

Calculations: In the primary circuit, with V, = 8.5 kV,

LC Energy Transfers In an oscillating LC circuit, energy is
shuttled periodically between the electric field of the capacitor and

‘Youcan check that J; = I,(N,/N,) as required by Eq.31-80.

(c) What is the resistive load R, in the secondary circuit? What
is the corresponding resistive load R, in the primary circuit?
One way: We can use V = JR to relate the resistive load to the
mms voltage and current. For the secondary circuit, we find

Second way: We use the fact that R, equals the equivalent re-
sistive load “seen” from the primary side of the transformer,
which is a resistance modified by the turns ratio and given by
Eq. 31-82 (Req = (Np/N,)°R). If we substitute R, for R., and R,
for R,that equation yields
