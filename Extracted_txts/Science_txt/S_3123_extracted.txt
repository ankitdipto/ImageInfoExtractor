as the differential equation of LC oscillations (with no resistance).
The solution of Eq. 31-11 is

q = Qcos(wt + ¢) (charge), (31-12)

in which Q is the charge amplitude (maximum charge on the capac-
itor) and the angular frequency of the oscillations is

o- Te (31-4)

The phase constant ¢ in Eq. 31-12 is determined by the initial con-
ditions (at t = 0) of the system.

in which wQ is the current amplitude I.

The solution of this differential equation is

where ol = Vw — (RAL). (31-26)

We consider only situations with small R and thus small damping;
then o! ~ w.

Alternating Currents; Forced Oscillations A series RLC
circuit may be set into forced oscillation at a driving angular fre-
quency «, by an external alternating emf

E=E, sin yt. (31-28)
The current driven in the circuit is
i= Isin(aut — 4), (31-29)

where ¢ is the phase constant of the current.

Resonance The current amplitude J in a series RLC circuit
driven by a sinusoidal external emf is a maximum (J = &,,/R) when
the driving angular frequency w, equals the natural angular
frequency w of the circuit (that is, at resonance). Then X- = X;,
¢ = 0, and the current is in phase with the emf.

Single Circuit Elements The alternating potential difference
across a resistor has amplitude Vp = JR; the current is in phase
with the potential difference.

For a capacitor, Ve = IX¢, in which X¢ = 1/@,C is the capacitive
reactance; the current here leads the potential difference by 90°
(@ = —90° = —7/2 rad).

<Questions

1 FRigure 31-19 shows three oscillating LC circuits with identical
inductors and capacitors. At a particular time, the charges on the
capacitor plates (and thus the electric fields between the plates)
are all at their maximum values. Rank the circuits according to the
time taken to fully discharge the capacitors during the oscillations,
greatest first.

ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS AND ALTERNATING CURRENT

For an inductor, V;, = IX; in which X1, = w,L is the inductive
reactance; the current here lags the potential difference by 90°
(@ = +90° = +772 rad).

Defining the impedance Z of the circuit as
Z= VR +(X,— X-)? (impedance) (31-61)

allows us to write Eq. 31-60 as J = €,,/Z.

Power In a series RLC circuit, the average power P,,, of the
generator is equal to the production rate of thermal energy in the
resistor:

Pag = DinsR = Ermstems COS (31-71, 31-76)

Here rms stands for root-mean-square; the rms quantities are
related to the maximum quantities by ims = I/-V2. Vimy = V/V2,
and €jms = €m/V2.The term cos dis called the power factor of the
circuit.

Transformers A transformer (assumed to be ideal) is an iron core
on which are wound a primary coil of N, turns and a secondary coil of
N, turns. If the primary coil is connected across an alternating-current
generator, the primary and secondary voltages are related by

N
V, = Vj=~ (transformation of voltage). (31-79)
YP
The currents through the coils are related by
N,
L=1, a (transformation of currents), (31-80)

and the equivalent resistance of the secondary circuit, as seen by

the generator, is
Nn,’
ra= (HJR.

(31-82)

where R is the resistive load in the secondary circuit. The ratio
N,/N, is called the transformer’s turns ratio.
