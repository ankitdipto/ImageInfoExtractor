certain emf amplitude is connected, ie
in turn, to a resistor, a capacitor, and
then an inductor. Once connected to
one of the devices, the driving fre-
quency fy is varied and the ampli-
tude J of the resulting current
through the device is measured and
plotted. Which of the three plots in
Fig. 31-22 corresponds to which of the three devices?

3.60 wF capacitor. If the maximum charge on the capacitor is
2.90 «C, what are (a) the total energy in the circuit and (b) the
maximum current?

what earliest time t > 0 will (a) plate A again have maximum positive
charge, (b) the other plate of the capacitor have maximum positive
charge, and (c) the inductor have maximum magnetic field?
