+24 © A single-loop circuit consists of a 7.20 0 resistor, a 12.0 H
inductor, and a 3.20 wF capacitor. Initially the capacitor has a
charge of 6.20 wC and the current is zero. Calculate the charge on
the capacitor N complete cycles later for (a) N = 5,(b) N = 10, and
(c) N= 100.

*°25 ILW What resistance R should be connected in series with an
inductance L = 220mH and capacitance C = 12.0 uF for the
maximum charge on the capacitor to decay to 99.0% of its initial
value in 50.0 cycles? (Assume w' ~ w.)

26 @ Inan oscillating series RLC circuit, find the time required
for the maximum energy present in the capacitor during an oscilla-
tion to fall to half its initial value. Assume g = Q att = 0.

**°27 SSM In an oscillating series RLC circuit, show that AU/U,
the fraction of the energy lost per cycle of oscillation, is given to a
close approximation by 27R/wL. The quantity wL/R is often called
the Q of the circuit (for quality). A high-Q circuit has low resis-
tance and a low fractional energy loss (= 27/Q) per cycle.
