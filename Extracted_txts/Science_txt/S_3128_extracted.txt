erage rate at which energy is dissipated

in resistance R is a maximum when R is

equal to the internal resistance r of the

ac generator. (In the text discussion we

tacitly assumed that r = 0.)

*62 A generator supplies 100 V to a transformer’s primary coil,
which has 50 turns. If the secondary coil has 500 turns, what is the
secondary voltage?

°63 ssm LW A transformer has 500 primary turns and 10 sec-
ondary turns. (a) If V, is 120 V (rms), what is V, with an open
circuit? If the secondary now has a resistive

load of 15 ©, what is the current in the (b) Ts

former.” It consists of a single coil (with an
iron core). Three taps J; are provided.
Between taps T, and 7) there are 200 turns,

(b) second smallest, and (c) largest values of the ratio V,/V,? For
a step-down transformer, what are the (d) smallest, (e) second
smallest, and (f) largest values of V,/V,?

65 An ac generator provides emf toa resistive load ina remote
factory over a two-cable transmission line. At the factory a step-
down transformer reduces the voltage from its (rms) transmission
value V, to a much lower value that is safe and convenient for use
in the factory. The transmission line resistance is 0.30 O/cable, and
the power of the generator is 250 kW. If V, = 80 kV, what are
(a) the voltage decrease AV along the transmission line and (b) the
rate P, at which energy is dissipated in the line as thermal energy?
If V; = 8.0 kV, what are (c) AV and (d) P,? If V; = 0.80 kV, what
are (e) AV and (f) P;?

66 In Fig. 31-35, let the rectangular box on the left represent the
(high-impedance) output of an audio amplifier, with r= 1000 Q.
Let R=10 © represent the (low-impedance) coil of a loud-
speaker. For maximum transfer of energy to the load R we must
have R =r, and that is not true in this case. However, a trans-
former can be used to “transform” resistances, making them be-
have electrically as if they were larger or smaller than they actu-
ally are. (a) Sketch the primary and secondary coils of a
transformer that can be introduced between the amplifier and
the speaker in Fig. 31-35 to match the impedances. (b) What must
be the turns ratio?

620 mA. (a) At what time after t = 0 does the generator emf first
reach a maximum? (b) At what time after ¢ = 0 does the current

other than the generator. Is it a capacitor, an inductor, or a resis-
tor? Justify your answer. (d) What is the value of the capacitance,
inductance, or resistance, as the case may be?
