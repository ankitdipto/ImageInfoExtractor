73 A capacitor of capacitance 158 uF and an inductor form an
LC circuit that oscillates at 8.15 kHz, with a current amplitude of
4.21 mA. What are (a) the inductance, (b) the total energy in the
circuit, and (c) the maximum charge on the capacitor?

74 An oscillating LC circuit has an inductance of 3.00 mH and a
capacitance of 10.0 uF. Calculate the (a) angular frequency and
(b) period of the oscillation. (c) At time t = 0, the capacitor is
charged to 200 uC and the current is zero. Roughly sketch the
charge on the capacitor as a function of time.

75 For acertain driven series RLC circuit, the maximum genera-
tor emf is 125 V and the maximum current is 3.20 A. If the current
leads the generator emf by 0.982 rad, what are the (a) impedance
and (b) resistance of the circuit? (c) Is the circuit predominantly
capacitive or inductive?

77 SSM In Fig. 31-38, a three-phase generator G produces electri-
cal power that is transmitted by means of three wires. The electric
potentials (each relative to a common reference level) are V; =
A sin et for wire 1, V)= A sin(«,t — 120°) for wire 2, and V; =
A sin(@,t — 240°) for wire 3. Some types of industrial equipment
(for example, motors) have three terminals and are designed to be
connected directly to these three wires. To use a more conventional
two-terminal device (for example, a
lightbulb), one connects it to any two
of the three wires. Show that the po- G
tential difference between any two of
the wires (a) oscillates sinusoidally
with angular frequency w, and (b)
has an amplitude of A-V3.

78 An electric motor connected to a 120 V, 60.0 Hz ac outlet does
mechanical work at the rate of 0.100 hp (1 hp = 746 W). (a) If the
motor draws an rms current of 0.650 A, what is its effective resis-
tance, relative to power transfer? (b) Is this the same as the resis-
tance of the motor’s coils, as measured with an ohmmeter with the
motor disconnected from the outlet?
