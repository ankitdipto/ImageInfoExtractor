the changing electric flux with a fictitious displacement cur-
rent ig. Then integral § B-ds is given by Eq. 32-11, but
because there is no real current i between the capacitor
plates, the equation reduces to

$ B+ dS = poidenc:

Calculations: Because we want to evaluate ¢ B-ds at
radius r = R/5 (within the capacitor), the integration loop en-
circles only a portion ij... of the total displacement current ig.
Let’s assume that i, is uniformly spread over the full plate
area. Then the portion of the displacement current encircled
by the loop is proportional to the area encircled by the loop:

(b) In terms of the maximum induced magnetic field, what is
the magnitude of the magnetic field induced at r= R/S,
inside the capacitor?

KEY IDEA

 

Because the capacitor has parallel circular plates, we can
treat the space between the plates as an imaginary wire of
radius R carrying the imaginary current i;. Then we can use
Eg. 32-16 to find the induced magnetic field magnitude B at
any point inside the capacitor.

Calculations: Atr = R/5, Eq. 32-16 yields

From Eg. 32-16, the maximum field magnitude B,,., within
the capacitor occurs at r = R. It is

Dividing Eq. 32-20 by Eq. 32-21 and rearranging the result,
we find that the field magnitude at r = R/S is

B= Brox (Answer)

We should be able to obtain this result with a little rea-
soning and less work. Equation 32-16 tells us that inside the
capacitor, B increases linearly with r. Therefore, a point 3 the
distance out to the full radius R of the plates, where Byax
occurs, should have a field B that is Baar
