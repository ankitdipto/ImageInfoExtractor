called the z axis) can be observed.

the spin magnetic quantum number m,, specifying the
allowed values of m,.

the orientation energy U of its spin magnetic dipole
moment Zi,.

32.27 Identify that an electron in an atom has an orbital
angular momentum Log and an orbital magnetic dipole
moment Hor.
