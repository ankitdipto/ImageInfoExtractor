32-5 MAGNETISM AND ELECTRONS 955

The orbital magnetic dipole moment /,,, of an electron also cannot itself be
measured; only its component along an axis can be measured, and that compo-
nent is quantized. By writing Eq. 32-28 for a component along the same z axis
as above and then substituting for L,,,., from Eg. 32-29, we can write the z
component 1y,,, of the orbital magnetic dipole moment as

eh
Bord = am (32-30)
and, in terms of the Bohr magneton, as
Horbz = — Mee. (32-31)

When an atom is placed in an external magnetic field B,,,, an energy U can be
associated with the orientation of the orbital magnetic dipole moment of each
electron in the atom. Its value is

I Har ea Hate es (32-32)

where the Z axis is taken in the direction of Baw

Although we have used the words “orbit” and “orbital” here, electrons do not
orbit the nucleus of an atom like planets orbiting the Sun. How can an electron
have an orbital angular momentum without orbiting in the common meaning of
the term? Once again, this can be explained only with quantum physics.

Loop Model for Electron Orbits

We can obtain Eq. 32-28 with the nonquantum derivation that follows, in which
we assume that an electron moves along a circular path with a radius that is much
larger than an atomic radius (hence the name “loop model”). However, the
derivation does not apply to an electron within an atom (for which we need
quantum physics).

We imagine an electron moving at constant speed v in a circular path of
radius r, counterclockwise as shown in Fig. 32-11. The motion of the negative
charge of the electron is equivalent to a conventional current i (of positive
charge) that is clockwise, as also shown in Fig. 32-11. The magnitude of the or-
bital magnetic dipole moment of such a current loop is obtained from Eq. 28-35
with N= 1:

Moxy = 1A, (32-33)

where A is the area enclosed by the loop. The direction of this magnetic dipole
moment is, from the right-hand rule of Fig.29-21, downward in Fig. 32-11.

To evaluate Eq. 32-33, we need the current i. Current is, generally, the rate
at which charge passes some point in a circuit. Here, the charge of magnitude
e takes a time T = 2mr/v to circle from any point back through that point, so

 

charge e
= = 5 32-34,
time 2arlv ( )
Substituting this and the area A = zr? of the loop into Eq. 32-33 gives us
_ ee > _ evr 7
bow = Fae mr = SE (32-35)

. To find the electron’s orbital angular momentum Los we use Eq. 11-18,
€ = m(7 X V).Because 7 and ¥ are perpendicular, L,,, has the magnitude

Loe = mrv sin 90° = mrv. (32-36)
The vector L,, is directed upward in Fig. 32-11 (see Fig. 11-12). Combining
