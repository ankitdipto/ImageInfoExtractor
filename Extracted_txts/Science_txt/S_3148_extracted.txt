Key Ideas

@ Paramagnetic materials have atoms with a permanent
magnetic dipole moment but the moments are randomly
oriented, with no net moment, unless the material is in an
external magnetic field B,,,, where the dipoles tend to align
with that field.

@ The extent of alignment within a volume V is measured as
the magnetization M, given by

volume gives a maximum value Max = Nu/V.

Paramagnetism

In paramagnetic materials, the spin and orbital magnetic dipole moments of the
electrons in each atom do not cancel but add vectorially to give the atom a net
(and permanent) magnetic dipole moment #4. In the absence of an external
magnetic field, these atomic dipole moments are randomly oriented, and the
net magnetic dipole moment of the material is zero. However, if a sample of the
material is placed in an external magnetic field B,,,, the magnetic dipole moments
tend to line up with the field, which gives the sample a net magnetic dipole
moment. This alignment with the external field is the opposite of what we saw
with diamagnetic materials.

YI a paramagnetic material placed in an external magnetic field B... develops a
magnetic dipole moment in the direction of B..,. If the field is nonuniform, the
paramagnetic material is attracted toward a region of greater magnetic field from
a region of lesser field.

A paramagnetic sample with N atoms would have a magnetic dipole moment
of magnitude Ny if alignment of its atomic dipoles were complete. However, ran-
dom collisions of atoms due to their thermal agitation transfer energy among the
atoms, disrupting their alignment and thus reducing the sample’s magnetic dipole
moment.

Thermal Agitation. The importance of thermal agitation may be measured
by comparing two energies. One, given by Eq. 19-24, is the mean translational ki-
netic energy K (= 3kT) of an atom at temperature T, where k is the Boltzmann
constant (1.38 X 10~°3 J/K) and Tis in kelvins (not Celsius degrees). The other,
