Figure 32-14 A magnetization curve for potas-
sium chromium sulfate, a paramagnetic salt.
The ratio of magnetization M of the salt to
the maximum possible magnetization M,,,. is
plotted versus the ratio of the applied mag-
netic field magnitude B,,, to the temperature
T. Curie’s law fits the data at the left; quan-
tum theory fits all the data. Based on mea-
surements by W. E. Henry.

derived from Eq. 28-38, is the difference in energy AUg (= 2B.) between par-
allel alignment and antiparallel alignment of the magnetic dipole moment of an
atom and the external field. (The lower energy state is —~B.., and the higher en-
ergy state is +B...) AS we shall show below, K > AUg, even for ordinary tem-
peratures and field magnitudes. Thus, energy transfers during collisions among
atoms can significantly disrupt the alignment of the atomic dipole moments,
keeping the magnetic dipole moment of a sample much less than Nu.

Magnetization. We can express the extent to which a given paramagnetic
sample is magnetized by finding the ratio of its magnetic dipole moment to its
volume V. This vector quantity, the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, is
the magnetization M ofthe sample, and its magnitude is

measured magnetic moment
V .

The unit of Mis the ampere—square meter per cubic meter, or ampere per meter
(A/m). Complete alignment of the atomic dipole moments, called saturation of
the sample, corresponds to the maximum value Myx = Nu/V.

In 1895 Pierre Curie discovered experimentally that the magnetization of a
paramagnetic sample is directly proportional to the magnitude of the external
magnetic field By, and inversely proportional to the temperature Tin kelvins:

M= (32-38)

B.
M=C +: (32-39)

Equation 32-39 is known as Curie’s law, and C is called the Curie constant. Curie’s
law is reasonable in that increasing B.. tends to align the atomic dipole moments
in a sample and thus to increase M, whereas increasing T tends to disrupt the
alignment via thermal agitation and thus to decrease M. However, the law is actu-
ally an approximation that is valid only when the ratio B,,,/T is not too large.

Figure 32-14 shows the ratio M/M,,,x as a function of B,,:/T for a sample of
the salt potassium chromium sulfate, in which chromium ions are the para-
magnetic substance. The plot is called a magnetization curve. The straight line
for Curie’s law fits the experimental data at the left, for B../T below about
0.5 T/K. The curve that fits all the data points is based on quantum physics. The
data on the right side, near saturation, are very difficult to obtain because they
require very strong magnetic fields (about 100 000 times Earth’s field), even at
very low temperatures.
