Sample Problem 32.03 Orientation energy of a paramagnetic gas in a magnetic field

A paramagnetic gas at room temperature (T = 300 K) is
placed in an external uniform magnetic field of magnitude
B =1.5T; the atoms of the gas have magnetic dipole mo-
ment yz = 1.0. Calculate the mean translational kinetic en-
ergy K of an atom of the gas and the energy difference AUg
between parallel alignment and antiparallel alignment of the
atom’s magnetic dipole moment with the external field.

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The mean translational kinetic energy K of an atom in
a gas depends on the temperature of the gas. (2) The en-
ergy Up of a magnetic dipole @ in an external magnetic
field B depends on the angle @ between the directions of
and B.

Calculations: From Eq. 19-24, we have
K =3kT =3(1.38 x 10-3 J/K)(300 K)

= 62 x 10-7 J = 0.039 eV. (Answer)

From Eg. 28-38 (Us = —f: B), we can write the difference
AU; between parallel alignment (@ = 0°) and antiparallel
alignment (@ = 180°) as
AU; = —B cos 180° — (—B cos 0°) = 2uB
= 2pupB = 2(9.27 x 10-* J/T)(1.5 T)

= 2.8 x 10° J = 0.000 17 eV. (Answer)

Here K is about 230 times AU; so energy exchanges among
the atoms during their collisions with one another can easily
reorient any magnetic dipole moments that might be aligned
with the external magnetic field. That is, as soon as a mag-
netic dipole moment happens to become aligned with the
external field, in the dipole’s low energy state, chances are
very good that a neighboring atom will hit the atom, transfer-
ring enough energy to put the dipole in a higher energy state.
Thus, the magnetic dipole moment exhibited by the para-
magnetic gas must be due to fleeting partial alignments of
the atomic dipole moments.

Key Ideas
@ The magnetic dipole moments in a ferromagnetic material
can be aligned by an external magnetic field and then, after
the external field is removed, remain partially aligned in
regions (domains).

@ Alignment is eliminated at temperatures above a material's
Curie temperature.

@ Inanonuniform external field, a ferromagnetic material is
attracted to the region of greater magnetic field.

 

Ferromagnetism

When we speak of magnetism in everyday conversation, we almost always
have a mental picture of a bar magnet or a disk magnet (probably clinging to a
refrigerator door). That is, we picture a ferromagnetic material having strong,
