33-1 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

today’s engineers is trying to envision what the global interconnection will be like
40 years from now. The starting point in meeting that challenge is understanding
the basic physics of electromagnetic waves, which come in so many different
types that they are poetically said to form Maxwell's rainbow.

Maxwell’s Rainbow

The crowning achievement of James Clerk Maxwell (see Chapter 32) was to
show that a beam of light is a traveling wave of electric and magnetic fields—an
electromagnetic wave —and thus that optics, the study of visible light, is a branch
of electromagnetism. In this chapter we move from one to the other: we conclude
our discussion of strictly electrical and magnetic phenomena, and we build a
foundation for optics.

In Maxwell’s time (the mid 1800s), the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet forms
of light were the only electromagnetic waves known. Spurred on by Maxwell’s
work, however, Heinrich Hertz discovered what we now call radio waves and
verified that they move through the laboratory at the same speed as visible light,
indicating that they have the same basic nature as visible light.

As Fig. 33-1 shows, we now know a wide spectrum (or range) of electromag-
netic waves: Maxwell’s rainbow. Consider the extent to which we are immersed in
electromagnetic waves throughout this spectrum. The Sun, whose radiations
define the environment in which we as a species have evolved and adapted, is
the dominant source. We are also crisscrossed by radio and television signals.
Microwaves from radar systems and from telephone relay systems may reach us.
There are electromagnetic waves from lightbulbs, from the heated engine blocks
of automobiles, from x-ray machines, from lightning flashes, and from buried
radioactive materials. Beyond this, radiation reaches us from stars and other
objects in our galaxy and from other galaxies. Electromagnetic waves also travel
in the other direction. Television signals, transmitted from Earth since about
1950, have now taken news about us (along with episodes of J Love Lucy, albeit
very faintly) to whatever technically sophisticated inhabitants there may be on
whatever planets may encircle the nearest 400 or so stars.
