CHAPTER 33 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

oriented as shown in Fig. 33-6, with the magnitude of E + dE greater than that of
E. Otherwise, the net induced electric field would not act counterclockwise
around the rectangle.

Faraday’s Law. Let us now apply Faraday’s law of induction,

counterclockwise around the rectangle of Fig. 33-6. There is no contribution to
the integral from the top or bottom of the rectangle because E and ds are per-
pendicular to each other there. The integral then has the value

$ E- ds =(E + dE)h — Eh=hdE. (33-7)
The flux ®, through this rectangle is

5 = (B)(hdx), (33-8)

where B is the average magnitude of B within the rectangle and h dy is the area
of the rectangle. Differentiating Eq. 33-8 with respect to f gives

If we substitute Eqs. 33-7 and 33-9 into Eq. 33-6, we find

Actually, both B and E are functions of two variables, coordinate x and time t, as
Eggs. 33-1 and 33-2 show. However, in evaluating dE/dx, we must assume that t is
constant because Fig. 33-6 is an “instantaneous snapshot.” Also, in evaluating
dB/dt we must assume that x is constant (a particular value) because we are deal-
ing with the time rate of change of B at a particular place, the point P shown in
Fig. 33-5b. The derivatives under these circumstances are partial derivatives, and
Eq. 33-10 must be written
fF 8. (33-11)

The minus sign in this equation is appropriate and necessary because, although
magnitude E is increasing with x at the site of the rectangle in Fig. 33-6, magni-
tude B is decreasing with t.
From Eq. 33-1 we have

0E
= kE,, cos(kx — wt)
and from Eq. 33-2
3 = —oB,, cos(kx — at).

Then Eq. 33-11 reduces to
kE,, cos(kx — at) = @B,, cos(kx — wt). (33-12)

The ratio w/k for a traveling wave is its speed, which we are calling c. Equation
33-12 then becomes

which is just Eq. 33-4.
