33-1 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

Equation 33-3 and the Induced Magnetic Field

Figure 33-7 shows another dashed rectangle at point P of Fig. 33-5b; this one is
in the xz plane. As the electromagnetic wave moves rightward past this new
rectangle, the electric flux ®; through the rectangle changes and—according to
Maxwell’s law of induction—induced magnetic fields appear throughout the
region of the rectangle. These induced magnetic fields are, in fact, the magnetic
component of the electromagnetic wave.

We see from Fig, 33-5b that at the instant chosen for the magnetic field repre-
sented in Fig. 33-6, marked in red on the magnetic component curve, the electric field
through the rectangle of Fig. 33-7 is directed as shown. Recall that at the chosen in-
stant, the magnetic field in Fig. 33-6 is decreasing. Because the two fields are in phase,
the electric field in Fig. 33-7 must also be decreasing, and so must the electric flux ®;
through the rectangle. By applying the same reasoning we applied to Fig. 33-6, we
see that the changing flux , will induce a magnetic field with vectors B and
B + dB oriented as shown in Fig, 33-7, where field B + dB is greater than field B.

Maxwell’s Law. Let us apply Maxwell’s law of induction,

d®,
Beds = SE
$ S = bo®o

by proceeding counterclockwise around the dashed rectangle of Fig. 33-7. Only
the long sides of the rectangle contribute to the integral because the dot product
along the short sides is zero. Thus, we can write

(33-14)

$ Beas = —(B + dB)h + Bh = —haB. (33-15)
The flux ®; through the rectangle is
®; = (E)(hdx), (33-16)

where E is the average magnitude of E within the rectangle. Differentiating
Eg. 33-16 with respect to f gives
d®z dE
=hdx—_.

If we substitute this and Eq. 33-15 into Eq. 33-14, we find

 

dE
—h dB = jue ( dx #)

or, changing to partial-derivative notation as we did for Eq. 33-11,

ox ot (33-17)

Again, the minus sign in this equation is necessary because, although B is increas-
ing with x at point P in the rectangle in Fig. 33-7, E is decreasing with f.
Evaluating Eq. 33-17 by using Eqs. 33-1 and 33-2 leads to
—kB,, cos(kx — wt) = —ppeyoE, cos(kx — wt),

which we can write as

Combining this with Eq. 33-13 leads at once to

 

c= (33-18)

(wave speed),
Moeo

which is exactly Eq. 33-3.

perpendicular magnetic field.

 

Figure 33-7 The sinusoidal variation of the
electric field through this rectangle, located
(but not shown) at point Pin Fig.33-5b,

decreasing in magnitude, and the magni-
tude of the induced magnetic field is
greater on the right side of the rectangle
than on the left.
