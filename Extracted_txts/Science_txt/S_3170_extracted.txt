33-2 ENERGY TRANSPORT AND THE POYNTING VECTOR

Energy Transport and the Poynting Vector

All sunbathers know that an electromagnetic wave can transport energy and
deliver it to a body on which the wave falls. The rate of energy transport per unit
area in such a wave is described by a vector S, called the Poynting vector after
physicist John Henry Poynting (1852-1914), who first discussed its properties.
This vector is defined as

2 lacs
S=——EXB (Poynting vert) (33-19)

Its magnitude S is related to the rate at which energy is transported by a wave
across a unit area at any instant (inst):

$= (saetine ) _ (= ) . (33-20)
area inst area ist

From this we can see that the SI unit for S is the watt per square meter (W/m7).

o The direction of the Poynting vector S of an electromagnetic wave at any
point gives the wave’s direction of travel and the direction of energy transport
at that point.

Because E and B are perpendicular to each other in an electromagnetic
wave, the magnitude of E x B is EB. Then the magnitude of S is

S= 4 EB, (33-21)

in which S, E, and B are instantaneous values. The magnitudes E and B are so
closely coupled to each other that we need to deal with only one of them; we
choose E, largely because most instruments for detecting electromagnetic waves
deal with the electric component of the wave rather than the magnetic compo-
nent. Using B = Elc from Eq. 33-5, we can rewrite Eq. 33-21 in terms of just the
electric component as

Intensity. By substituting E = E,, sin(kx — at) into Eq. 33-22, we could ob-
tain an equation for the energy transport rate as a function of time. More useful
in practice, however, is the average energy transported over time; for that,
we need to find the time-averaged value of S, written S,,. and also called the
intensity / of the wave. Thus from Eq. 33-20, the intensity J is

Over a full cycle, the average value of sin? 6, for any angular variable 6, is } (see
Fig. 31-17). In addition, we define a new quantity E,,, the root-mean-square
value of the electric field, as
