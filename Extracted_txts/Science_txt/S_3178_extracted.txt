Sample Problem 33.02 Polarization and intensity with three polarizing sheets

Figure 33-15a, drawn in perspective, shows a system of three
polarizing sheets in the path of initially unpolarized light.
The polarizing direction of the first sheet is parallel to the y
axis, that of the second sheet is at an angle of 60° counter-
clockwise from the y axis, and that of the third sheet is paral-
lel to the x axis. What fraction of the initial intensity Jp of the
light emerges from the three-sheet system, and in which
direction is that emerging light polarized?

KEY IDEAS

1. We work through the system sheet by sheet, from the
first one encountered by the light to the last one.

2. To find the intensity transmitted by any sheet, we apply
either the one-half rule or the cosine-squared rule,
depending on whether the light reaching the sheet is
unpolarized or already polarized.

3. The light that is transmitted by a polarizing sheet is always
polarized parallel to the polarizing direction of the sheet.

First sheet: The original light wave is represented in
Fig. 33-15, using the head-on, double-arrow representation
of Fig. 33-10b. Because the light is initially unpolarized, the
intensity J, of the light transmitted by the first sheet is given
by the one-half rule (Eq. 33-36):

L =$h.

The emerging light is polarized
60° counterclockwise from the
vertical. The intensity is given by
the cosine-squared rule.

Intensity rules:

If the incident light is unpolarized,
use the one-half rule:

Temerge = O-5lincident »

If the incident light is already polarized,
use the cosine-squared rule:

emerge = Incident(os 0),
