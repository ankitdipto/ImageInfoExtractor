STP means “standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (1 atm).”

Law of refraction: A refracted ray lies in the plane of incidence and has an
angle of refraction @, that is related to the angle of incidence 6, by

ny sin @ =n, sin A (refraction). (33-40)

Here each of the symbols m, and nj is a dimensionless constant, called the index
of refraction, that is associated with a medium involved in the refraction. We
derive this equation, called Snell’s law, in Chapter 35. As we shall discuss there,
the index of refraction of a medium is equal to c/v, where v is the speed of light in
that medium and cis its speed in vacuum.

Table 33-1 gives the indexes of refraction of vacuum and some common
substances. For vacuum, n is defined to be exactly 1; for air,n is very close to 1.0 (an
approximation we shall often make). Nothing has an index of refraction below 1.

We can rearrange Eq. 33-40 as

sin @ =~“ sin 4 (33-41)
Ny
to compare the angle of refraction @, with the angle of incidence 6. We can
then see that the relative value of @, depends on the relative values of ny and ny:

1. If m is equal to m,, then @, is equal to @ and refraction does not bend the light
beam, which continues in the undeflected direction, as in Fig. 33-17a.

refracted light then travels in the undeflected direction (the dotted line), which is the same
as the direction of the incident beam. The beam bends (b) toward the normal when n2 > 1
and (c) away from the normal when n) <n.
