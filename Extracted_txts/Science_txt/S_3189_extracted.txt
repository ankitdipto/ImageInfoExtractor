and is given by B, = B,, sin(kz — wf), (a) in what direction does
the wave travel and (b) parallel to which axis does the associated
electric field oscillate?

CHAPTER 33 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

2 Suppose we rotate the second
sheet in Fig. 33-15a, starting with the
polarization direction aligned with
the y axis (@ = 0) and ending with it
aligned with the x axis (@ = 90°).
Which of the four curves in Fig. 33-26
best shows the intensity of the light through the three-sheet system
during this 90° rotation?

Figure 33-26 Question 2.

3 (a) Figure 33-27 shows light reaching
a polarizing sheet whose polarizing di-
rection is parallel to a y axis. We shall
rotate the sheet 40° clockwise about the
light’s indicated line of travel. During
this rotation, does the fraction of the
initial light intensity passed by the sheet
increase, decrease, or remain the same if
the light is (a) initially unpolarized,
(b) initially polarized parallel to the x
axis, and (c) initially polarized parallel to
the y axis?

4 Figure 33-28 shows the electric and magnetic
fields of an electromagnetic wave at a certain in-
stant. Is the wave traveling into the page or out of
the page?

 

5 In the arrangement of Fig. 33-15a, start with

light that is initially polarized parallel to the x axis, and write
the ratio of its final intensity J; to its initial intensity Jy as Iy/Jp =
A cos" 6. What are A, n, and @ if we rotate the polarizing direction
of the first sheet (a) 60° counterclockwise and (b) 90° clockwise
from what is shown?

6 In Fig, 33-29, unpolarized light is
sent into a system of five polarizing
sheets. Their polarizing directions,
measured counterclockwise from the
positive direction of the y axis, are the
following: sheet 1, 35°; sheet 2, 0°
sheet 3, 0°; sheet 4, 110°; sheet 5, 45°.
Sheet 3 is then rotated 180° counter-
clockwise about the light ray. During
that rotation, at what angles (mea-
sured counterclockwise from the y
axis) is the transmission of light
through the system eliminated?

als, with air above and below them.

Figure 33-33 Question 10.

11 Each part of Fig. 33-34 shows light that refracts through an
interface between two materials. The incident ray (shown gray in
the figure) consists of red and blue light. The approximate index of
refraction for visible light is indicated for each material. Which of
the three parts show physically possible refraction? (Hint: First
consider the refraction in general, regardless of the color, and then
consider how red and blue light refract differently.)

material a, through three layers of
other materials with surfaces parallel
to one another, and then back into an-
other layer of material a. The refrac-
tions (but not the associated reflec-
tions) at the surfaces are shown. Rank
the materials according to index of re-
fraction, greatest first. (Hint: The par-
allel arrangement of the surfaces al-
