How the /ac repressor works. (a) The lac repressor. Because the repressor fills the major groove of the DNA helix, RNA polymerase
cannot fully attach to the promoter, and transcription is blocked. () The /ac operon is shut down (“repressed”) when the repressor protein
is bound to the operator site. Because promoter and operator sites overlap, RNA polymerase and the repressor cannot functionally bind at
the same time, any more than two people can sit in the same chair at once. (¢) The /ac operon is transcribed (“induced”) when CAP is
bound and when lactose binding to the repressor changes its shape so that it can no longer sit on the operator site and block RNA

polymerase activity.

‘Two regulatory proteins control the Jac
operon. Together, the /ac repressor and CAP
provide a very sensitive response to the cell’s need
to utilize lactose-metabolizing enzymes.
