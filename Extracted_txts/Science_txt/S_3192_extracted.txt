36 <= At a beach the light is generally partially polarized
due to reflections off sand and water. At a particular beach on
a particular day near sundown, the horizontal component of the
electric field vector is 2.3 times the vertical component. A stand-
ing sunbather puts on polarizing sunglasses; the glasses eliminate
the horizontal field component. (a) What fraction of the light in-
tensity received before the glasses were put on now reaches the
sunbather’s eyes? (b) The sunbather, still wearing the glasses, lies
on his side. What fraction of the light intensity received before
the glasses were put on now reaches his eyes?

37 SSM WWW We want to rotate the direction of polarization
of a beam of polarized light through 90° by sending the beam

number of sheets required? (b) What is the minimum number of
sheets required if the transmitted intensity is to be more than 60%
of the original intensity?

three polarizing sheets. The angles 6;, 6, and 6; of the polarizing
directions are measured counterclockwise from the positive di-
rection of the y axis (they are not drawn to scale). Angles @ and

mixture of polarized and unpolarized light. Suppose we send such
a beam through a polarizing filter and then rotate the filter
through 360° while keeping it perpendicular to the beam. If the
transmitted intensity varies by a factor of 5.0 during the rotation,
what fraction of the intensity of the original beam is associated
with the beam’s polarized light?

possible values of angle @ (< 90°) for the polarizing direction of
