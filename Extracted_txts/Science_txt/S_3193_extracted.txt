ray that refracts toward O at the top
surface of the liquid is shown. If
D =85.0.cm and L = 1.10m, what
is the index of refraction of the
liquid?

°46 In Fig, 33-47a, a light ray in
an underlying material is incident
at angle @, on a boundary with water, and some of the light
refracts into the water. There are two choices of underlying ma-
terial. For each, the angle of refraction @ versus the incident
angle 6; is given in Fig, 33-47b. The horizontal axis scale is set by
6;, = 90°. Without calculation, determine whether the index of
refraction of (a) material 1 and (b) material 2 is greater or less
than the index of water (n = 1.33). What is the index of refrac-
tion of (c) material 1 and (d) material 2?

°47 Light in vacuum is incident on the surface of a glass slab. In
the vacuum the beam makes an angle of 32.0° with the normal to
the surface, while in the glass it makes an angle of 21.0° with the
normal. What is the index of refraction of the glass?

48 In Fig, 33-48a,a light ray in water is incident at angle @; on a
boundary with an underlying material, into which some of the
light refracts. There are two choices of underlying material. For
each, the angle of refraction 6, versus the incident angle 6, is
given in Fig, 33-48. The vertical axis scale is set by 0, = 90°.
Without calculation, determine whether the index of refraction of
(a) material 1 and (b) material 2 is greater or less than the index
of water (n = 1.33). What is the index of refraction of (c) material
1 and (d) material 2?

*49 Figure 33-49 shows light re-
flecting from two perpendicular
reflecting surfaces A and B. Find the
angle between the incoming ray i
and the outgoing ray r’.

50 In Fig, 33-50a, a beam of light
in material 1 is incident on a bound-
ary at an angle 6, = 40°. Some of the
light travels through material 2, and then some of it emerges into
material 3. The two boundaries between the three materials are
parallel. The final direction of the beam depends, in part, on the
index of refraction n; of the third material. Figure 33-50b gives
the angle of refraction @ in that material versus n3 for a range of
possible n; values. The vertical axis scale is set by 0, = 30.0° and
y, = 50.0°. (a) What is the index of refraction of material 1, or is
the index impossible to calculate without more information?
(b) What is the index of refraction of material 2, or is the index im-
possible to calculate without more information? (c) If 6; is changed
to 70° and the index of refraction of material 3 is 2.4, what is 6;?

51 ® In Fig. 33-51, light is incident
at angle 6; = 40.1° ona boundary be-
tween two transparent materials.
Some of the light travels down
through the next three layers of
transparent materials, while some of
it reflects upward and then escapes
into the air. If m, = 1.30, ny = 1.40,
ny = 1.32, and ny = 1.45, what is the
value of (a) 45 in the air and (b) 0; in
the bottom material?

52 In Fig. 33-52a,a beam of light
in material 1 is incident on a bound-
ary at an angle of #; = 30°. The extent of refraction of the light into
material 2 depends, in part, on the index of refraction > of material
2. Figure 33-52b gives the angle of refraction @; versus n, for a
range of possible n) values. The vertical axis scale is set by
6, =20.0° and 6, = 40.0°. (a) What is the index of refraction of
