53 SSM WWW _ ILW In Fig. 33-53, a ray is incident on one face
of a triangular glass prism in air. The angle of incidence 0 is chosen
so that the emerging ray also makes the same angle @ with the nor-
mal to the other face. Show that the index of refraction n of the
glass prism is given by

_ sinx(v +t 4)

singd
where ¢ is the vertex angle of the prism and y is the deviation
angle, the total angle through which the beam is turned in passing,
through the prism. (Under these conditions the deviation angle yy
has the smallest possible value, which is called the angle of mini-
mum deviation.)

54 <= Dispersion in a window pane. In
Fig. 33-54, a beam of white light is incident at an-
gle @ = 50° on a common window pane (shown
in cross section). For the pane’s type of glass, the
index of refraction for visible light ranges from
1.524 at the blue end of the spectrum to 1.509 at
the red end. The two sides of the pane are paral-
lel. What is the angular spread of the colors in the
beam (a) when the light enters the pane and
(b) when it emerges from the opposite side?
(Hint: When you look at an object through a window pane, are
the colors in the light from the object dispersed as shown in, say,
Fig. 33-20?)

+55 @ ssm In Fig. 33-55, a 2.00-
m-long vertical pole extends from
the bottom of a swimming pool to a
point 50.0cm above the water.
Sunlight is incident at angle @=
55.0°. What is the length of the
shadow of the pole on the level bot-
tom of the pool?

56 <= Rainbows from square
drops. Suppose that, on some sur-
real world, raindrops had a square cross sec-
tion and always fell with one face horizontal.
Figure 33-56 shows such a falling drop, with a
white beam of sunlight incident at @ = 70.0° at
point P. The part of the light that enters the
drop then travels to point A, where some of it
refracts out into the air and the rest reflects. A
That reflected light then travels to point B,
where again some of the light refracts out into
the air and the rest reflects. What is the differ- °

ence in the angles of the red light (m= 1.331) Figure 39-56
and the blue light (n = 1.343) that emerge at Problem 56.
