1006 CHAPTER 33 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

64 Suppose the prism of Fig, 33-53 has apex angle ¢ = 60.0°
and index of refraction n = 1.60. (a) What is the smallest angle of
incidence 6 for which a ray can enter the left face of the prism and
exit the right face? (b) What angle of incidence @is required for the
ray to exit the prism with an identical angle @ for its refraction, as it
does in Fig. 33-53?

65 @ Figure 33-61 depicts a sim-
plistic optical fiber: a plastic core
(n, = 1.58) is surrounded by a plastic
sheath (n, = 1.53). A light ray is inci-
dent on one end of the fiber at angle
6. The ray is to undergo total internal
reflection at point A, where it en-
counters the core-sheath bound-
ary. (Thus there is no loss of light
through that boundary.) What is the maximum value of @ that allows
total internal reflection at A?

66 © In Fig. 33-62, a light ray in
air is incident at angle 6, on a block
of transparent plastic with an index
of refraction of 1.56. The dimen-
sions indicated are H=2.00cm 4
and W = 3.00cm. The light passes
through the block to one of its sides

and there undergoes reflection (in- 9
side the block) and possibly
refraction (out into the air). This is
the point of first reflection. The re-
flected light then passes through
the block to another of its sides—a point of second reflection. If
4, = 40°, on which side is the point of (a) first reflection and
(b) second reflection? If there is refraction at the point of (c) first
reflection and (d) second reflection, give the angle of refraction;
if not, answer “none.” If @; = 70°, on which side is the point of
(e) first reflection and (f) second reflection? If there is refrac-
tion at the point of (g) first reflection and (h) second reflection,
give the angle of refraction; if not, answer “none.”

67 @ Inthe ray diagram of Fig. 33-63, where the angles are not
drawn to scale, the ray is incident at the critical angle on the inter-
face between materials 2 and 3. Angle ¢ = 60.0°, and two of the in-
dexes of refraction are n, = 1.70 and ny = 1.60. Find (a) index of
refraction n; and (b) angle 6. (c) If Gis decreased, does light refract
into material 3?

Module 33-7 Polarization by Reflection

°68 (a) At what angle of incidence will the light reflected from
water be completely polarized? (b) Does this angle depend on the
wavelength of the light?

°69 ssM Light that is traveling in water (with an index of refrac-
tion of 1.33) is incident on a plate of glass (with index of refraction
1.53). At what angle of incidence does the reflected light end up
fully polarized?

70 In Fig. 33-64, a light ray in air is incident on a flat layer of
material 2 that has an index of refraction n, = 1.5. Beneath mate-
rial 2 is material 3 with an index of refraction n;. The ray is inci-
dent on the air—material 2 interface at the Brewster angle for that
interface. The ray of light refracted into material 3 happens to be
incident on the material 2—material 3 interface at the Brewster
angle for that interface. What is the value of n3?

Additional Problems

71 SSM (a) How long does it take a radio signal to travel 150 km
from a transmitter to a receiving antenna? (b) We see a full Moon
by reflected sunlight. How much earlier did the light that enters
our eye leave the Sun? The Earth—-Moon and Earth-Sun dis-
tances are 3.8 X 10° km and 1.5 X 10° km, respectively. (c) What is
the round-trip travel time for light between Earth and a spaceship
orbiting Saturn, 1.3 X 10° km distant? (d) The Crab nebula, which
is about 6500 light-years (ly) distant, is thought to be the result of a
supernova explosion recorded by Chinese astronomers in A.D.
1054. In approximately what year did the explosion actually occur?
(When we look into the night sky, we are effectively looking back
in time.)

els through vacuum in the positive direction of an x axis. The wave
has its electric field oscillating parallel to the y axis, with an ampli-
tude E,,,. At time t = 0,the electric field at point P on the x axis has a
value of +E£,,/4 and is decreasing with time. What is the distance
along the x axis from point P to the first point with E = 0 if we

the x axis?

critical radius.
