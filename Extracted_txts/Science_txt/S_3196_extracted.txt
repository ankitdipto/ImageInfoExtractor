sent into a system of four polarizing
sheets with polarizing directions at

where 6; is the angle of incidence of the ray on the drop and 6, is
the angle of refraction of the ray within the drop. (b) Using Snell's
law, substitute for 6, in terms of 6; and the index of refraction n of

graphing package, graph @j.. versus 6, for the range of possible 4,
values and for n = 1.331 for red light (at one end of the visible
spectrum) and n = 1.333 for blue light (at the other end).

The red-light curve and the blue-light curve have different
minima, which means that there is a different angle of minimum
deviation for each color. The light of
any given color that leaves the drop S,
at that color’s angle of minimum de-
viation is especially bright because [nadent
rays bunch up at that angle.Thus, the ray
bright red light leaves the drop at
one angle and the bright blue light
leaves it at another angle.

mum deviation from the @ey curve Figure 33-67 Problem 77.

for (c) red light and (d) blue light. (e) If these colors form the inner
and outer edges of a rainbow (Fig, 33-21a), what is the angular
width of the rainbow?

78 <= The primary rainbow described in Problem 77 is the
type commonly seen in regions where rainbows appear. It is pro-
duced by light reflecting once inside the drops. Rarer is the sec-
ondary rainbow described in Module 33-5, produced by light
reflecting twice inside the drops (Fig. 33-682). (a) Show that the
angular deviation of light entering and then leaving a spherical
water drop is
Oaoy = (180°)k + 20, — 2k + 1)8,,

where k is the number of internal reflections. Using the procedure
of Problem 77, find the angle of minimum deviation for (b) red
light and (c) blue light in a secondary rainbow. (d) What is the
angular width of that rainbow (Fig.33-21d)?

The tertiary rainbow depends on three internal reflections
(Fig. 33-685). It probably occurs but, as noted in Module 33-5,
cannot be seen with the eye because it is very faint and lies in the
bright sky surrounding the Sun. What is the angle of minimum de-
viation for (e) the red light and (f) the blue light in this rainbow?
(g) What is the rainbow’s angular width?
