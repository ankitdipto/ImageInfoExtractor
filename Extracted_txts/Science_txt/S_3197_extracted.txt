1008 CHAPTER 33 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

81 The magnetic component of a polarized wave of light is

B, = (4.0 X 10°°T) sin[(1.57 X 10’ my + of}.

(a) Parallel to which axis is the light polarized? What are the
(b) frequency and (c) intensity of the light?

82 In Fig. 33-70, unpolarized light
is sent into the system of three po-
larizing sheets, where the polarizing
directions of the first and third
sheets are at angles @; = 30° (coun-
terclockwise) and @ = 30° (clock-
wise). What fraction of the initial
light intensity emerges from the
system?

83 SSM A ray of white light travel-
ing through fused quartz is incident
at a quartz—air interface at angle @).
Assume that the index of refraction
of quartz is n = 1.456 at the red end of the visible range and n =
1.470 at the blue end. If 6, is (a) 42.00°, (b) 43.10°, and (c) 44.00°, is
the refracted light white, white dominated by the red end of the
visible range, or white dominated by the blue end of the visible
range, or is there no refracted light?

84 Three polarizing sheets are stacked. The first and third are
crossed; the one between has its polarizing direction at 45.0° to the
polarizing directions of the other two. What fraction of the inten-
sity of an originally unpolarized beam is transmitted by the stack?

85 In a region of space where gravitational forces can be
neglected, a sphere is accelerated by a uniform light beam of inten-
sity 6.0 mW/m?. The sphere is totally absorbing and has a radius of
2.0 um and a uniform density of 5.0 X 10° kg/m}, What is the mag-
nitude of the sphere’s acceleration due to the light?

86 An unpolarized beam of light is sent into a stack of four po-
larizing sheets, oriented so that the angle between the polarizing
directions of adjacent sheets is 30°. What fraction of the incident
intensity is transmitted by the system?

87 SSM During atest,a NATO surveillance radar system, operat-
ing at 12 GHz at 180 kW of power, attempts to detect an incoming
stealth aircraft at 90 km. Assume that the radar beam is emitted
uniformly over a hemisphere. (a) What is the intensity of the beam
when the beam reaches the aircraft’s location? The aircraft reflects
radar waves as though it has a cross-sectional area of only 0.22 m?.
(b) What is the power of the aircraft’s reflection? Assume that the
beam is reflected uniformly over a hemisphere. Back at the radar
site, what are (c) the intensity, (d) the maximum value of the elec-
tric field vector, and (e) the rms value of the magnetic field of the
reflected radar beam?

88 The magnetic component of an electromagnetic wave in vac-
uum has an amplitude of 85.8 nT and an angular wave number of
4.00 m~!. What are (a) the frequency of the wave, (b) the rms value
of the electric component, and (c) the intensity of the light?

89 Calculate the (a) upper and (b) lower limit of the Brewster
angle for white light incident on fused quartz. Assume that the
wavelength limits of the light are 400 and 700 nm.

90 In Fig. 33-71, two light rays pass from air through five layers of
transparent plastic and then back into air. The layers have parallel
interfaces and unknown thicknesses; their indexes of refraction are
ny = 1.7,m = 1.6, n; = 15,ny = 1.4,and ns = 1.6. Ray b is incident

at angle @, = 20°. Relative to a normal at the last interface, at what
angle do (a) raya and (b) ray b emerge? (Hint: Solving the prob-
lem algebraically can save time.) If the air at the left and right sides
in the figure were, instead, glass with index of refraction 1.5, at
what angle would (c) ray a and (d) ray b emerge?

91 A helium-neon laser, radiat-
ing at 632.8 nm, has a power output
of 3.0mW. The beam diverges
(spreads) at angle = 0.17 mrad
(Fig. 33-72). (a) What is the intensity
of the beam 40 m from the laser? (b)
What is the power of a point source providing that intensity at that
distance?

92 In about a.p. 150, Claudius Ptolemy gave the following meas-
ured values for the angle of incidence 6, and the angle of refraction
6, for a light beam passing from air to water:

4, 4 a o

10° 8° 50° 35°
20° 15°30" 60° 40°30!
30° 22°30' 70° 45°30!
40° 29° 80° 50°

Assuming these data are consistent with the law of refraction, use
them to find the index of refraction of water. These data are inter-
esting as perhaps the oldest recorded physical measurements.

93 A beam of initially unpolarized light is sent through two
polarizing sheets placed one on top of the other. What must be
the angle between the polarizing directions of the sheets if the
intensity of the transmitted light is to be one-third the incident
intensity?

94 In Fig. 33-73, a long, straight copper wire (diameter 2.50 mm
and resistance 1.00 per 300 m) carries a uniform current of 25.0 A
in the positive x direction. For point P on the wire’s surface, calcu-
late the magnitudes of (a) the electric field E, (b) the magnetic
field B, ,and (c) the Poynting vector S,and (d) determine the direc-
tion of S.
