glides at a constant 15 m/s horizon-
tally above level ground, moving in
a vertical plane that contains the
Sun. It glides toward a wall of height
h = 2.0 m, which it will just barely

of the Sun relative to the ground is
@ = 30°. At what speed does the
shadow of the albatross move (a) across the level ground and
then (b) up the wall? Suppose that later a hawk happens to glide
along the same path, also at 15 m/s. You see that when its shadow
reaches the wall, the speed of the shadow noticeably increases.
