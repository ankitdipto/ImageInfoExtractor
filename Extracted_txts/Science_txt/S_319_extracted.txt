16.4 Transcriptional control in eukaryotes operates at a distance.

Designing a Complex Gene
Control System

As we have seen, combinations of ON and OFF control
switches allow bacteria to regulate the transcription of par-
ticular genes in response to the immediate metabolic de-
mands of their environment. All of these switches work by
interacting directly with RNA polymerase, either blocking
or enhancing its binding to specific promoters. There is a
limit to the complexity of this sort of regulation, however,
because only a small number of switches can be squeezed
into and around one promoter. In a eukaryotic organism
that undergoes a complex development, many genes must
interact with one another, requiring many more interacting
elements than can fit around a single promoter (table 16.1).

In eukaryotes, this physical limitation is overcome by
having distant sites on the chromosome exert control over
the transcription of a gene (figure 16.13). In this way, many
regulatory sequences scattered around the chromosomes
can influence a particular gene’s transcription. This
“control-at-a-distance” mechanism includes two features: a
set of proteins that help bind RNA polymerase to the pro-
moter, and modular regulatory proteins that bind to distant
sites. These two features produce a truly flexible control
system.

A eukaryotic promoter. This promoter for the gene encoding
the enzyme thymidine kinase contains the TATA box that the
initiation factor binds to, as well as three other DNA sequences
that direct the binding of other elements of the transcription
complex.
