Figure 34-11 (a, b) Four rays that may be
drawn to find the image formed by a con-
cave mirror. For the object position

shown, the image is real, inverted, and
smaller than the object. (c, d) Four similar
rays for the case of a convex mirror. For a
convex mirror, the image is always virtual,
oriented like the object, and smaller than
the object. [In (c), ray 2 is initially directed
toward focal point F. In (d), ray 3 is initial-
ly directed toward center of curvature C.]

Organizing Table. Equations 34-3 through 34-6 hold for all plane mirrors,
concave spherical mirrors, and convex spherical mirrors. In addition to those
equations, you have been asked to absorb a lot of information about these
mirrors, and you should organize it for yourself by filling in Table 34-1. Under
Image Location, note whether the image is on the same side of the mirror as
the object or on the opposite side. Under Image Type, note whether the image
is real or virtual. Under Image Orientation, note whether the image has the
same orientation as the object or is inverted. Under Sign, give the sign of the
quantity or fill in + if the sign is ambiguous. You will need this organization to
tackle homework or a test.

Locating Images by Drawing Rays

Figures 34-11a and b show an object O in front of a concave mirror. We can
graphically locate the image of any off-axis point of the object by drawing a ray
diagram with any two of four special rays through the point:

Any two of these four rays
will locate the image.

Here too, any two rays
will locate the image.
