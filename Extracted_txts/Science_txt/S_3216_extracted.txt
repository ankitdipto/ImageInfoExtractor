34-4 THIN LENSES 1027

Two-Lens Systems

Here we consider an object sitting in front of a system of two lenses whose
central axes coincide. Some of the possible two-lens systems are sketched in
Fig. 34-17, but the figures are not drawn to scale. In each, the object sits to the left
of lens 1 but can be inside or outside the focal point of the lens. Although tracing
the light rays through any such two-lens system can be challenging, we can use
the following simple two-step solution:

Step 1 Neglecting lens 2, use Eq. 34-9 to locate the image J, produced by lens 1.
Determine whether the image is on the left or right side of the lens, whether
it is real or virtual, and whether it has the same orientation as the object.
Roughly sketch /,.The top part of Fig. 34-17a gives an example.
