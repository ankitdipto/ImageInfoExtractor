Calculations: We know p, but we do not know i. Thus, our
starting point is to finish the calculation for i in part (a); we
obtain.

i = (0.25)(20 cm) = 5.0 cm.
Now Eg. 34-9 gives us

11.1 1 1

from which we find f = 4.0 cm.

 

 

Sample Problem 34.04

Figure 34-18a shows a jalapefio seed O, that is placed in
front of two thin symmetrical coaxial lenses 1 and 2, with fo-
cal lengths f, = +24 cm and f, = +9.0 cm, respectively, and
with lens separation L = 10 cm.The seed is 6.0 cm from lens
1. Where does the system of two lenses produce an image of
the seed?

KEY IDEA

 

We could locate the image produced by the system of
lenses by tracing light rays from the seed through the two
lenses. However, we can, instead, calculate the location of
that image by working through the system in steps, lens by
lens. We begin with the lens closer to the seed. The image we
seek is the final one —that is, image J, produced by lens 2.

Lens 1: Ignoring lens 2, we locate the image J, produced by
lens 1 by applying Eq. 34-9 to lens 1 alone:

The object O, for lens 1 is the seed, which is 6.0 cm from the
lens; thus, we substitute p; = +6.0 cm. Also substituting the
given value of f,, we then have

~ +24cm”

+6.0 cm i

which yields i; = —8.0 cm.

This tells us that image J, is 8.0 cm from lens 1 and vir-
tual. (We could have guessed that it is virtual by noting that
the seed is inside the focal point of lens 1, that is, between
the lens and its focal point.) Because J, is virtual, it is on the
same side of the lens as object O, and has the same orienta-
tion as the seed, as shown in Fig. 34-18.

Lens 2: In the second step of our solution, we treat image J;
as an object O) for the second lens and now ignore lens 1.
We first note that this object O, is outside the focal point

Equation 34-10 then gives us

peo-n(t-2)=-o(-2)

or, with known values inserted,

= (LS = I)
4.0 cm ( ) r’

which yields

r = (0.65)(2)(4.0 cm) = 5.2 cm. (Answer)
