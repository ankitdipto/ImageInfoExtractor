Figure 34-23 A real point image / of a point
object O is formed by refraction at a
spherical convex surface between two
media.

A trigonometry theorem that is useful here tells us that an exterior angle of a
triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. Applying this to
triangles OaC and Oal in Fig. 34-22 yields

B=a+@ and y=a+20.
If we eliminate @ between these two equations, we find
at y= 2£. (34-16)
We can write angles a, 8,and y,in radian measure, as
ac ac ac | ac

and ~T a (34-17)
where the overhead symbol means “arc.” Only the equation for f is exact, because
the center of curvature of ac is at C. However, the equations for a and y are
approximately correct if these angles are small enough (that is, for rays close to the
central axis). Substituting Eqs. 34-17 into Eq. 34-16, using Eq. 34-3 to replace r with
2f,and canceling ac lead exactly to Eq. 34-4, the relation that we set out to prove.

The Refracting Surface Formula (Eq. 34-8)

The incident ray from point object O in Fig. 34-23 that falls on point a of a spheri-
cal refracting surface is refracted there according to Eq. 33-40,

ny sin 6; = ny sin 6.
Tf ais small, @, and @ will also be small and we can replace the sines of these
angles with the angles themselves. Thus, the equation above becomes

‘We again use the fact that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the
two opposite interior angles. Applying this to triangles COa and Ca yields
A=a+B and B=H+y. (34-19)
Tf we use Eqs. 34-19 to eliminate 4, and 6) from Eq. 34-18, we find
mat my = (ny —m)B. (34-20)
In radian measure the angles a, B,and yare

Only the second of these equations is exact. The other two are approximate
because J and O are not the centers of circles of which ac is a part. However, for
a small enough (for rays close to the axis), the inaccuracies in Eqs. 34-21 are small.
Substituting Eqs. 34-21 into Eq. 34-20 leads directly to Eq. 34-8, as we wanted.

The Thin-Lens Formulas (Eqs. 34-9 and 34-10)

Our plan is to consider each lens surface as a separate refracting surface, and to
use the image formed by the first surface as the object for the second.

We start with the thick glass “lens” of length L in Fig. 34-24a whose left and
right refracting surfaces are ground to radii r’ andr". A point object O' is placed
near the left surface as shown. A ray leaving O' along the central axis is not
deflected on entering or leaving the lens.

A second ray leaving O’ at an angle a@ with the central axis intersects the left
surface at point a’, is refracted, and intersects the second (right) surface at point a’.
