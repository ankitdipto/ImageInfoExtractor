Figure 34-24 (a) Two rays from point object O'
form a real image J” after refracting through
two spherical surfaces of a lens. The object
faces a convex surface at the left side of the
lens and a concave surface at the right side.
The ray traveling through points a’ and a’ is
actually close to the central axis through the ;
lens. (b) The left side and (c) the right side of ||| & ”

the lens in (a), shown separately.

The ray is again refracted and crosses the axis at /", which, being the intersection of
two rays from O’, is the image of point O’, formed after refraction at two surfaces.

Figure 34-24b shows that the first (left) surface also forms a virtual image of
O' at I'.To locate I’, we use Eq. 34-8,

Putting m, = 1 for air and n) = n for lens glass and bearing in mind that the (vir-
tual) image distance is negative (that is,i = —i’ in Fig. 34-24), we obtain

(Because the minus sign is explicit, i’ will be a positive number.)

Figure 34-24c shows the second surface again. Unless an observer at point
a" were aware of the existence of the first surface, the observer would think that
the light striking that point originated at point J’ in Fig. 34-24b and that the
region to the left of the surface was filled with glass as indicated. Thus, the (vir-
tual) image I’ formed by the first surface serves asa real object O" for the second
surface. The distance of this object from the second surface is

p= +L. (34-23)
To apply Eq. 34-8 to the second surface, we must insert mn, =n and ny) =1

because the object now is effectively imbedded in glass. If we substitute with
Eq. 34-23, then Eq. 34-8 becomes

Let us now assume that the thickness L of the “lens” in Fig. 34-24a is so small
that we can neglect it in comparison with our other linear quantities (such as p’,
i’, p", i", r', and r"). In all that follows we make this thin-lens approximation.
Putting L = 0 in Eq. 34-24 and rearranging the right side lead to
