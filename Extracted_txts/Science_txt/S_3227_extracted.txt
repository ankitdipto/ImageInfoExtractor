Module 34-1 Images and Plane Mirrors

*1Youlook through a camera toward an image of a hummingbird in
a plane mirror. The camera is 4.30 m in front of the mirror. The bird is
at camera level,5.00 m to your right and 3.30 m from
the mirror. What is the distance between the camera
and the apparent position of the bird’s image in the
mirror?

°2 tLw A moth at about eye level is 10 cmin front
of a plane mirror; you are behind the moth, 30 cm
from the mirror. What is the distance between your
eyes and the apparent position of the moth’s im-
age in the mirror?

**3. In Fig, 34-32, an isotropic point source of light

[pu

S is positioned at distance d from a
viewing screen A and the light inten-
sity Jp at point P (level with S) is
measured. Then a plane mirror M is
placed behind S at distance d. By
how much is Ip multiplied by the
presence of the mirror?

view of a corridor with a plane mir-
ror M mounted at one end. A bur-
glar B sneaks along the corridor di-
rectly toward the center of the
mirror. If d = 3.0 m, how far from
the mirror will she be when the se-
curity guard S can first see her in
the mirror?

Module 34-2 Spherical Mirrors

6 An object is moved along the = 2
central axis of a spherical mirror
while the lateral magnification m of it
is measured. Figure 34-35 gives m 9, he

versus object distance p for the range
P, = 2.0.cm to p, = 8.0. cm. What is m
for p= 14.0cm?

°7 Aconcave shaving mirror has a radius of curvature of 35.0 cm.
It is positioned so that the (upright) image of a man’s face is 2.50
times the size of the face. How far is the mirror from the face?

13 Spherical mirrors. Object O
stands on the central axis of a spher-
ical mirror. For this situation, each problem in Table 34-3 gives ob-
ject distance p, (centimeters), the type of mirror, and then the dis-
tance (centimeters, without proper sign) between the focal point
and the mirror. Find (a) the radius of curvature r (including sign),
(b) the image distance i, and (c) the lateral magnification m. Also,
determine whether the image is (d) real (R) or virtual (V), (e) in-
verted (I) from object O or noninverted (NI), and (f) on the same
side of the mirror as O or on the opposite side.
