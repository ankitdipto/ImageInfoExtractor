uation, each problem in Table 34-4 refers to (a) the type of mirror,
(b) the focal distance f, (c) the radius of curvature r,(d) the object
distance p, (e) the image distance i, and (f) the lateral magnifica-
tion m. (All distances are in cen- 1

timeters.) It also refers to whether

(g) the image is real (R) or virtual

(V), (h) inverted (1) or noninverted

(NI) from O, and (i) on the same * °5

side of the mirror as object O or on

the opposite side. Fill in the missing

information. Where only a sign is 0 he

missing, answer with the sign.

+30 © Figure 34-37 gives the lat-
eral magnification m of an object
versus the object distance p from a spherical mirror as the object is
moved along the mirror’s central axis through a range of values for
p.The horizontal scale is set by p, = 10.0 cm. What is the magnifica-
tion of the object when the object is 21 cm from the mirror?

°°31 (a) A luminous point is moving at speed vo toward a spheri-
cal mirror with radius of curvature r, along the central axis of the
mirror. Show that the image of this point is moving at speed

(w=)

where p is the distance of the luminous point from the mirror at
any given time. Now assume the mirror is concave, with r = 15 cm,

and let vg = 5.0 cm/s. Find v; when (b) p = 30 cm (far outside the
focal point), (c) p = 8.0cm (just outside the focal point), and
(d) p = 10 mm (very near the mirror).

Module 34-3 Spherical Refracting Surfaces

32 through 38 @ 37,38 SSM 33,35 Spherical refracting sur-
faces. An object O stands on the central axis of a spherical refract-
ing surface. For this situation, each problem in Table 34-5 refers to
the index of refraction n; where the object is located, (a) the index
of refraction n) on the other side of the refracting surface, (b) the
object distance p, (c) the radius of curvature r of the surface, and
(d) the image distance i. (All distances are in centimeters.) Fill in
the missing information, including whether the image is (e) real
(R) or virtual (V) and (f) on the same side of the surface as object
Oor on the opposite side.

39 In Fig. 34-38, a beam of parallel light rays from a laser is in-
cident on a solid transparent sphere of index of refraction n. (a) If
a point image is produced at the

back of the sphere, what is the index

of refraction of the sphere? (b)

What index of refraction, if any, will

produce a point image at the center

of the sphere?
