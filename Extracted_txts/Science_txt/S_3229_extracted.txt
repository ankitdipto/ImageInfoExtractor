Module 34-4 Thin Lenses

41 A lens is made of glass having an index of refraction of
1.5. One side of the lens is flat, and the other is convex with a
radius of curvature of 20 cm. (a) Find the focal length of the
lens. (b) If an object is placed 40 cm in front of the lens, where
is the image?

42 Figure 34-40 gives the lateral
magnification m of an object versus
the object distance p from a lens as
the object is moved along the cen-
tral axis of the lens through a range
of values for p out to p, = 20.0 cm.
What is the magnification of the ob- 0
ject when the object is 35 cm from

the lens?

Sun on a screen, using a thin lens whose focal length is 20.0 cm.
What is the diameter of the image? (See Appendix C for needed
data on the Sun.)

lens is to be made of glass with an
index of refraction of 1.5. One sur-
face is to have twice the radius of Figure 34-42 Problem 46.

°48 An object is moved along the central axis of a thin lens while
the lateral magnification m is measured. Figure 34-43 gives m ver-

°49 SSM An illuminated slide is held 44 cm from a screen. How
far from the slide must a lens of focal length 11 cm be placed (be-
tween the slide and the screen) to form an image of the slide’s pic-
ture on the screen?

50 through 57 @ 55,57 SSM 53 Thin lenses. Object O stands
on the central axis of a thin symmetric lens. For this situation, each
problem in Table 34-6 gives object distance p (centimeters), the
type of lens (C stands for converging and D for diverging), and
then the distance (centimeters, without proper sign) between a
focal point and the lens. Find (a) the image distance i and (b) the
lateral magnification m of the object, including signs. Also, deter-
mine whether the image is (c) real (R) or virtual (V), (d) inverted
(1) from object O or noninverted (NI), and (e) on the same side of
the lens as object O or on the opposite side.
