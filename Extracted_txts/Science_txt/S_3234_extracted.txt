115 A point object is 10 cm away from a plane mirror, and the
eye of an observer (with pupil diameter 5.0 mm) is 20 cm away.
Assuming the eye and the object to be on the same line perpendi-
cular to the mirror surface, find the area of the mirror used in
observing the reflection of the point. (Hint: Adapt Fig. 34-4.)

object and screen, will form a real image on the screen for two
lens positions that are separated by a distance d = VD(D — 4f).

118 An eraser of height 1.0 cm is placed 10.0 cm in front of a
two-lens system. Lens 1 (nearer the eraser) has focal length f, =
—15 cm, lens 2 has f; = 12 cm, and the lens separation is d = 12 cm.
For the image produced by lens 2, what are (a) the image distance
i; (including sign), (b) the image height, (c) the image type (real or
virtual), and (d) the image orientation (inverted relative to the
eraser or not inverted)?

119 A peanut is placed 40 cm in front of a two-lens system:
lens 1 (nearer the peanut) has focal length f, = +20 cm, lens 2 has
f, = —15 cm, and the lens separation is d = 10 cm. For the image
produced by lens 2, what are (a) the image distance i (including
sign), (b) the image orientation (inverted relative to the peanut
or not inverted), and (c) the image type (real or virtual)?
(d) What is the net lateral magnification?

120 A coinis placed 20 cm in front of a two-lens system. Lens 1
(nearer the coin) has focal length f; = +10 cm, lens 2 has fy =
+12.5 cm, and the lens separation is d = 30 cm. For the image pro-
duced by lens 2, what are (a) the image distance /, (including sign),
(b) the overall lateral magnification, (c) the image type (real or

122 In Fig 34-58 a pinecone is at
distance p,; = 1.0 m in front of a lens
of focal length f, = 0.50 m;a flat mir-
ror is at distance d = 2.0 m behind
the lens. Light from the pinecone
passes rightward through the lens,
reflects from the mirror, passes left-
ward through the lens, and forms a
final image of the pinecone. What
are (a) the distance between the lens and that image and (b) the
overall lateral magnification of the pinecone? Is the image (c) real
or virtual (if it is virtual, it requires someone looking through the
lens toward the mirror), (d) to the left or right of the lens, and
(e) inverted relative to the pinecone or not inverted?

123 One end of a long glass rod (n = 1.5) is a convex surface of
radius 6.0 cm. An object is located in air along the axis of the rod, at
a distance of 10 cm from the convex end. (a) How far apart are the

PROBLEMS 1045

object and the image formed by the glass rod? (b) Within what
range of distances from the end of the rod must the object be
located in order to produce a virtual image?

124 Ashort straight object of length L lies along the central axis
of a spherical mirror, a distance p from the mirror. (a) Show that its
image in the mirror has a length L', where

L'= (Ly.

(Hint: Locate the two ends of the object.) (b) Show that the /ongi-
tudinal magnification m'(= L'/L) is equal to m?, where m is the
lateral magnification.

125 Prove that if a plane mirror is rotated through an angle a,
the reflected beam is rotated through an angle 2a. Show that this
result is reasonable for a = 45°.

126 An object is 30.0 cm from a spherical mirror, along the
mirror’s central axis. The mirror produces an inverted image with a
lateral magnification of absolute value 0.500. What is the focal
length of the mirror?

127 A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of 24 cm. How
far is an object from the mirror if the image formed is (a) virtual
and 3.0 times the size of the object, (b) real and 3.0 times the size of
the object,and (c) real and 1/3 the size of the object?

128 A pepper seed is placed in front of a lens. The lateral magni-
fication of the seed is +0.300. The absolute value of the lens’s focal
length is 40.0 cm. How far from the lens is the image?

129 The equation I/p + 1/i = 2ir for spherical mirrors is an
approximation that is valid if the image is formed by rays that
make only small angles with the central axis. In reality, many of the
angles are large, which smears the image a little. You can deter-
mine how much. Refer to Fig. 34-22 and consider a ray that leaves
a point source (the object) on the central axis and that makes an
angle a with that axis.

First, find the point of intersection of the ray with the mirror.
If the coordinates of this intersection point are x and y and the ori-
gin is placed at the center of curvature, then y = (x + p — r) tana
and x? + y? = 7, where p is the object distance and r is the mirror’s
radius of curvature. Next, use tan 8 = y/x to find the angle f at the
point of intersection, and then use a + y = 2f to find the value
of y. Finally, use the relation tan y = y/(x + i — r) to find the dis-
tance i of the image.

(a) Suppose r = 12 cm and p = 20 cm. For each of the
following values of a, find the position of the image — that is, the
position of the point where the reflected ray crosses the central
axis: 0.500, 0.100, 0.0100 rad. Compare the results with those
obtained with the equation 1/p + 1/i = 2/r.(b) Repeat the calcula-
tions for p = 4.00 cm.

130 A small cup of green tea is positioned on the central axis of a
spherical mirror. The lateral magnification of the cup is +0.250,
and the distance between the mirror and its focal point is 2.00 cm.
(a) What is the distance between the mirror and the image it pro-
duces? (b) Is the focal length positive or negative? (c) Is the image
real or virtual?

131 A 20-mm-thick layer of water (n = 1.33) floats on a
40-mm-thick layer of carbon tetrachloride (n = 1.46) in a tank. A
coin lies at the bottom of the tank. At what depth below the top
water surface do you perceive the coin? (Hint: Use the result and
assumptions of Problem 112 and work with a ray diagram.)
