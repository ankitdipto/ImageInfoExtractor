CHAPTER 35 INTERFERENCE

point P is part of a bright fringe. When, instead, AL is an odd multiple of half a
wavelength, the waves arrive at the common point exactly out of phase and they
interfere fully destructively there. If that is true for the waves of rays r; and 1,
then point P is part of a dark fringe. (And, of course, we can have intermediate
situations of interference and thus intermediate illumination at P.) Thus,

interference experiment is determined by the path length difference AL of the
rays reaching that point.

Angle. We can specify where each bright fringe and each dark fringe is
located on the screen by giving the angle @ from the central axis to that fringe. To
find 6, we must relate it to AL. We start with Fig. 35-10a by finding a point b along
ray r; such that the path length from b to P equals the path length from S, to P.
Then the path length difference AL between the two rays is the distance from
S,tob.

The relation between this S,-to-b distance and @ is complicated, but we can
simplify it considerably if we arrange for the distance D from the slits to the
screen to be much greater than the slit separation d. Then we can approximate
rays 7, and ry as being parallel to each other and at angle @ to the central axis
(Fig. 35-10b). We can also approximate the triangle formed by Sj, S>, and b as
being a right triangle, and approximate the angle inside that triangle at S> as
being @.Then, for that triangle,sin 9 = AL /d and thus

AL =dsin @ (path length difference). (35-12)

For a bright fringe, we saw that AL must be either zero or an integer number of
wavelengths. Using Eq. 35-12, we can write this requirement as

AL = dsin 0 = (integer)(A), (35-13)

dsind=mdA, form =0,1,2,... (maxima—bright fringes). (35-14)

For a dark fringe, AL must be an odd multiple of half a wavelength. Again using
Eq. 35-12, we can write this requirement as

AL = dsin @ = (odd number)(5A), (35-15)
oras

dsin@=(m+4)A, form =0,1,2,... — (minima—dark fringes). (35-16)

With Eqs. 35-14 and 35-16, we can find the angle @ to any fringe and thus
locate that fringe; further, we can use the values of m to label the fringes. For
the value and label m = 0, Eq. 35-14 tells us that a bright fringe is at 9=0
and thus on the central axis. This central maximum is the point at which waves
arriving from the two slits have a path length difference AL = 0, hence zero
phase difference.

For, say,m = 2, Eq. 35-14 tells us that bright fringes are at the angle

above and below the central axis. Waves from the two slits arrive at these two
fringes with AL = 2A and with a phase difference of two wavelengths. These
fringes are said to be the second-order bright fringes (meaning m = 2) or the
second side maxima (the second maxima to the side of the central maximum), or
