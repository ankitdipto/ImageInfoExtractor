they are described as being the second bright fringes from the central
maximum.
Form = 1,Eq. 35-16 tells us that dark fringes are at the angle

above and below the central axis. Waves from the two slits arrive at these two
fringes with AL = 1.5A and with a phase difference, in wavelengths, of 1.5. These
fringes are called the second-order dark fringes or second minima because they are
the second dark fringes to the side of the central axis. (The first dark fringes, or first
minima, are at locations for which m = 0 in Eq. 35-16.)

Nearby Screen. We derived Eqs. 35-14 and 35-16 for the situation D > d.
However, they also apply if we place a converging lens between the slits and the
viewing screen and then move the viewing screen closer to the slits, to the focal
point of the lens. (The screen is then said to be in the focal plane of the lens; that
is, itis in the plane perpendicular to the central axis at the focal point.) One prop-
erty of a converging lens is that it focuses all rays that are parallel to one another
to the same point on its focal plane. Thus, the rays that now arrive at any point on
the screen (in the focal plane) were exactly parallel (rather than approximately)
when they left the slits. They are like the initially parallel rays in Fig. 34-14a that
are directed to a point (the focal point) by alens.

In Fig. 35-10a, what are AL (asa multiple of the wavelength) and the phase difference
(in wavelengths) for the two rays if point Pis (a) a third side maximum and (b) a third
minimum?

 

Sample Problem 35.02 Double-slit interference pattern

What is the distance on screen C in Fig. 35-10a between
adjacent maxima near the center of the interference pattern?
The wavelength A of the light is 546 nm, the slit separation d
is 0.12mm, and the slit-screen separation D is 55cm.
Assume that @ in Fig. 35-10 is small enough to permit use of
the approximations sin @ ~ tan @ ~ 6, in which @is expressed
in radian measure.

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) First, let us pick a maximum with a low value of m to
ensure that it is near the center of the pattern. Then, from
the geometry of Fig. 35-10a, the maximum’s vertical distance
ym from the center of the pattern is related to its angle 0
from the central axis by
Ym
tan 9~ 9==".
land~ 0 D
(2) From Eq. 35-14, this angle @ for the mth maximum is
given by
ma

ne

Calculations: If we equate our two expressions for angle 0
and then solve for y,,, we find

maD
Ym = (35-17)
For the next maximum as we move away from the pattern’s
center, we have
(m + 1)AD
Yin+1 = —q

(35-18)
We find the distance between these adjacent maxima by
subtracting Eq. 35-17 from Eq. 35-18:
AD
AY = Yet — Ym = A
_ (546 x 10-° m)(55 x 10°? m)
- 0.12 x 10-3 m

= 2.50 x 103m ~ 2.5mm. (Answer)

As long as d and @in Fig. 35-10a are small, the separation of
the interference fringes is independent of m; that is, the
fringes are evenly spaced.
