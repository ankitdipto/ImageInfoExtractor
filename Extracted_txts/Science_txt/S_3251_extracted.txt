CHAPTER 35 INTERFERENCE

If we square each side of this relation, we obtain
E? = 4Ejcos*$¢. (35-29)

Intensity. Now, from Eq. 33-24, we know that the intensity of an electromag-
netic wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Therefore, the waves we
are combining in Fig. 35-13b, whose amplitudes are E, each has an intensity Jp
that is proportional to £3, and the resultant wave, with amplitude E, has an inten-
sity / that is proportional to E?. Thus,

In ER”
Substituting Eq. 35-29 into this equation and rearranging then yield

I= 4ly cos*} 4,
which is Eq. 35-22, which we set out to prove.
We still must prove Eq. 35-23, which relates the phase difference ¢ between

the waves arriving at any point P on the screen of Fig. 35-10 to the angle @ that
serves as a locator of that point.

The phase difference ¢ in Eq. 35-21 is associated with the path length differ-
ence S,b in Fig. 35-10b. If S,b is 3A, then dis z;if S\b is A, then ¢ is 27, and so on.

This suggests
phase _ 2m (path length

The path length difference S,b in Fig. 35-105 is d sin 0 (a leg of the right triangle);
so Eg. 35-30 for the phase difference between the two waves arriving at point P
on the screen becomes
o= 2nd. 8
=~ sin 6,
which is Eq. 35-23, the other equation that we set out to prove to relate ¢ to the
angle @ that locates P.

 

Combining More Than Two Waves

In a more general case, we might want to find the resultant of more than two
sinusoidally varying waves at a point. Whatever the number of waves is, our
general procedure is this:

1. Construct a series of phasors representing the waves to be combined. Draw
them end to end, maintaining the proper phase relations between adjacent
phasors.

2. Construct the vector sum of this array. The length of this vector sum gives
the amplitude of the resultant phasor. The angle between the vector sum
and the first phasor is the phase of the resultant with respect to this first pha-
sor. The projection of this vector-sum phasor on the vertical axis gives the time
variation of the resultant wave.

lv] Checkpoint 4

Each of four pairs of light waves arrives at a certain point on a screen. The waves have
the same wavelength. At the arrival point, their amplitudes and phase differences are
(a) 2Ep, 6E,and mrad; (b) 3Ey,5 Ey, and zrrad; (c) 9Ey, 7Ey,and 3rrad; (d) 2E,2E,
and 0 rad. Rank the four pairs according to the intensity of the light at the arrival
point, greatest first. (Hint: Draw phasors.)
