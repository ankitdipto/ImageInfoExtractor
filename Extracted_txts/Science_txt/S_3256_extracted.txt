35-4 INTERFERENCE FROM THIN FILMS 1067

Film Thickness Much Less Than A

A special situation arises when a film is so thin that L is much less than A, say,
L <0.1A. Then the path length difference 2L can be neglected, and the phase
difference between r, and ry is due only to reflection phase shifts. If the film of
Fig. 35-17, where the reflections cause a phase difference of 0.5 wavelength,
has thickness L < 0.1A, then r, and ry are exactly out of phase, and thus the film
is dark, regardless of the wavelength and intensity of the light. This special situa-
tion corresponds to m = 0 in Eq. 35-37. We shall count any thickness L <0.1A as
being the least thickness specified by Eq. 35-37 to make the film of Fig. 35-17
dark. (Every such thickness will correspond to m = 0.) The next greater thickness
that will make the film dark is that corresponding to m = 1.

In Fig. 35-18, bright white light illuminates a vertical soap film whose thick-
ness increases from top to bottom. However, the top portion is so thin that it is
dark. In the (somewhat thicker) middle we see fringes, or bands, whose color de-
pends primarily on the wavelength at which reflected light undergoes fully con-
structive interference for a particular thickness. Toward the (thickest) bottom the
fringes become progressively narrower and the colors begin to overlap and fade.

The top portion is so thin (due to gravita-
tional slumping) that the light reflected
there undergoes destructive interference,
making that portion dark. Colored inter-
ference fringes, or bands, decorate the rest
of the film but are marred by circulation

Sample Problem 35.05 Thin-film interference of a water film in air

White light, with a uniform intensity across the visible wave-
length range of 400 to 690 nm, is perpendicularly incident on
a water film, of index of refraction m = 1.33 and thickness
L = 320 nm, that is suspended in air. At what wavelength A is
the light reflected by the film brightest to an observer?

KEY IDEA

 

The reflected light from the film is brightest at the wave-
lengths A for which the reflected rays are in phase with one
another. The equation relating these wavelengths A to the
given film thickness L and film index of refraction np is
either Eq. 35-36 or Eq. 35-37, depending on the reflection
phase shifts for this particular film.

Calculations: To determine which equation is needed, we
should fill out an organizing table like Table 35-1. However,
because there is air on both sides of the water film, the situa-
tion here is exactly like that in Fig. 35-17, and thus the table
would be exactly like Table 35-1. Then from Table 35-1, we

see that the reflected rays are in phase (and thus the film is
brightest) when
OL = odd number x ae
2 ny
which leads to Eq. 35-36:

2b = (m+)

Solving for A and substituting for L and np, we find

AS 2nnL_ __(2)(1.33)(320nm) _ 851 nm
m+} m+3 ~ m+h-

For m = 0, this gives us A = 1700 nm, which is in the infrared
region. For m = 1, we find A = 567 nm, which is yellow-green
light, near the middle of the visible spectrum. For m = 2,A =
340 nm, which is in the ultraviolet region. Thus, the wave-
length at which the light seen by the observer is brightest is

A = 567 nm. (Answer)
