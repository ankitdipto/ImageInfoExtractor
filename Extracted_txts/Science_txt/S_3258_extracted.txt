We want the reflected waves

2L to change that. Thus,

Figure 35-20 (a) Red light is incident on a thin, air-filled wedge in the side of a transparent plastic block. The thickness of the

wedge is L, at the left end and L at the right end. (b) The view from above the block: an interference pattern of six dark fringes
and five bright red fringes lies over the region of the wedge. (c) A representation of the incident ray i, reflected rays 7; and r>,and
