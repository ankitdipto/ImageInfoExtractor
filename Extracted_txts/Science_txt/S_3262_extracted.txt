paths indicated. Rank the pulses according to their travel time
through the plastic layers, greatest first.

5 Is there an interference maximum, a minimum, an intermedi-
ate state closer to a maximum, or an intermediate state closer to a
minimum at point P in Fig. 35-10 if the path length difference of
the two rays is (a) 2.2A, (b) 3.5A, (c) 1.8A, and (d) 1.0? For each
situation, give the value of m associated with the maximum or
minimum involved.

6 Figure 35-24a gives intensity / versus position x on the viewing
screen for the central portion of a two-slit interference pattern.
The other parts of the figure give phasor diagrams for the electric
field components of the waves arriving at the screen from the two
slits (as in Fig. 35-13a). Which numbered points on the screen best
correspond to which phasor diagram?

7 Figure 35-25 shows two sources S; and S) that emit radio waves
of wavelength A in all directions. The sources are exactly in phase
and are separated by a distance equal to 1.5A. The vertical broken
line is the perpendicular bisector of the distance between the
sources. (a) If we start at the indicated start point and travel along
path 1, does the interference produce a maximum all along the
path, a minimum all along the path, or alternating maxima and
minima? Repeat for (b) path 2 (along an axis through the sources)
and (c) path 3 (along a perpendicular to that axis).

8 Figure 35-26 shows two rays of
light, of wavelength 600 nm, that re-
flect from glass surfaces separated
by 150 nm. The rays are initially in
phase. (a) What is the path length
difference of the rays? (b) When
they have cleared the reflection re-
gion, are the rays exactly in phase,
exactly out of phase, or in some intermediate state?

When a peak of the wave is at one end of the nanostructure, is
there a peak or a valley at the other end if the wavelength is (a) 500

13 Figure 35-30 shows three situations in which two rays of sun-
light penetrate slightly into and then scatter out of lunar soil.
Assume that the rays are initially in phase. In which situation are
the associated waves most likely to end up in phase? (Just as the
Moon becomes full, its brightness suddenly peaks, becoming 25%
greater than its brightness on the nights before and after, because
at full Moon we intercept light waves that are scattered by lunar
soil back toward the Sun and undergo constructive interference at
our eyes. Before astronauts first landed on the Moon, NASA was
concerned that backscatter of sunlight from the soil might blind
the lunar astronauts if they did not have proper viewing shields on
their helmets.)
