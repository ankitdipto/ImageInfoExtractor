Module 35-1 Light as a Wave

*1 In Fig. 35-31, a light wave along
ray r; reflects once from a mirror and
a light wave along ray r, reflects twice
from that same mirror and once from
a tiny mirror at distance L from the
bigger mirror. (Neglect the slight tilt
of the rays.) The waves have wave-
length 620 nm and are initially in phase. (a) What is the smallest value
of L that puts the final light waves exactly out of phase? (b) With the
tiny mirror initially at that value of L, how far must it be moved away
from the bigger mirror to again put the final waves out of phase?

2 In Fig. 35-31, a light wave along ray r; reflects once from a
mirror and a light wave along ray > reflects twice from that same

irror and once from a tiny mirror at distance L from the bigger
mirror. (Neglect the slight tilt of the rays.) The waves have wave-
length A and are initially exactly out of phase. What are the
(a) smallest, (b) second smallest, and (c) third smallest values of
L/A that result in the final waves being exactly in phase?

*3 ssM In Fig. 35-4, assume that two waves of light in air, of
wavelength 400 nm, are initially in phase. One travels through a glass
layer of index of refraction n, = 1.60 and thickness L. The other
travels through an equally thick plastic layer of index of refraction
n = 1.50. (a) What is the smallest value L should have if the waves
are to end up with a phase difference of 5.65 rad? (b) If the waves
arrive at some common point with the same amplitude, is their inter-
ference fully constructive, fully destructive, intermediate but closer
to fully constructive, or intermediate but closer to fully destructive?

*4 In Fig, 35-32a, a beam of light in material 1 is incident on a
boundary at an angle of 30°. The extent to which the light is bent
due to refraction depends, in part, on the index of refraction n of
material 2. Figure 35-32b gives the angle of refraction @ versus n,
for a range of possible np values, from n, = 1.30 to n, = 1.90. What
is the speed of light in material 1?

sapphire than in diamond? See Table 33-1.

*6 The wavelength of yellow sodium light in air is 589 nm. (a)
What is its frequency? (b) What is its wavelength in glass whose in-
dex of refraction is 1.52? (c) From the results of (a) and (b), find its
speed in this glass.

+7 The speed of yellow light (from a sodium lamp) in a certain
liquid is measured to be 1.92 x 10* m/s. What is the index of refrac-
tion of this liquid for the light?

*°9 In Fig. 35-4, assume that the two light waves, of wavelength
620 nm in air, are initially out of phase by a rad. The indexes of
refraction of the media are n, = 1.45 and nj = 1.65. What are the
(a) smallest and (b) second smallest value of L that will put the
waves exactly in phase
once they pass through
the two media?

situations the waves arrive at a common point (with the same ampli-
tude) after emerging. Rank the situa- le!
tions according to the brightness the Id
waves produce at the common point.

12 In Fig. 35-35, two light rays go
through different paths by reflecting
from the various flat surfaces
shown. The light waves have a wave-
length of 420.0 nm and are initially
in phase. What are the (a) smallest
and (b) second smallest value of dis-
tance L that will put the waves ex-
actly out of phase as they emerge
from the region?
