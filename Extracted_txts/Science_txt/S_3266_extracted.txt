soap film in air has an interference maximum at 600 nm and a min-
imum at 450 nm, with no minimum in between. If m = 1.33 for the
film, what is the film thickness, assumed uniform?

“54 A plane wave of monochromatic light is incident normally
on a uniform thin film of oil that covers a glass plate. The wave-
length of the source can be varied continuously. Fully destructive
interference of the reflected light is observed for wavelengths of
500 and 700 nm and for no wavelengths in between. If the index of
refraction of the oil is 1.30 and that of the glass is 1.50, find the
thickness of the oil film.

#55 SSM www A disabled tanker leaks kerosene (n = 1.20)
into the Persian Gulf, creating a large slick on top of the water
(n = 1.30). (a) If you are looking straight down from an airplane,
while the Sun is overhead, at a region of the slick where its thick-
ness is 460 nm, for which wavelength(s) of visible light is the reflec-
tion brightest because of constructive interference? (b) If you are
scuba diving directly under this same region of the slick, for which
wavelength(s) of visible light is the transmitted intensity strongest?

56 A thin film, with a thickness of 272.7 nm and with air on
both sides, is illuminated with a beam of white light. The beam is
perpendicular to the film and consists of the full range of wave-
lengths for the visible spectrum. In the light reflected by the film,
light with a wavelength of 600.0 nm undergoes fully constructive
interference. At what wavelength does the reflected light undergo
fully destructive interference? (Hint: You must make a reasonable
assumption about the index of refraction.)

plates. Initially, a dark fringe lies at the a
left end, a bright fringe lies at the right
end, and nine dark fringes lie between
those two end fringes. The plates are
then very gradually squeezed together at a constant rate to
decrease the angle between them. As a result, the fringe at the
right side changes between being bright to being dark every 15.0
