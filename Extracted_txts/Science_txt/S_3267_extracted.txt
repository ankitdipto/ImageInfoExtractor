1078 CHAPTER 35 INTERFERENCE

nm is incident perpendicularly onto the top plate. The air between the
plates acts as a thin film. Nine dark fringes and eight bright fringes are
observed from above the top plate. If the distance between the two
plates along the separated edges is increased by 600 nm, how many
dark fringes will there then be across the top plate?

75 SSM ILW Figure 35-46ashows a lens with radius of curvature R
lying on a flat glass plate and illu-
minated from above by light with
wavelength A. Figure 35-46b (a
photograph taken from above
the lens) shows that circular in-
terference fringes (known as
Newton's rings) appear, associ-
ated with the variable thickness d
of the air film between the lens
and the plate. Find the radii r of
the interference maxima assum-
ing/R <1. (@

“76 The lens in a Newton’s rings experiment (see Problem 75) has
diameter 20 mm and radius of curvature R = 5.0m. For A = 589 nm
in air, how many bright rings are produced with the setup (a) in air
and (b) immersed in water (n = 1.33)?

°°77 A Newton's rings apparatus is to be used to determine the
radius of curvature of a lens (see Fig. 35-46 and Problem 75). The
radii of the nth and (n + 20)th bright rings are found to be 0.162
and 0,368 cm, respectively, in light of wavelength 546 nm. Calculate
the radius of curvature of the lower surface of the lens.

°78 A thin film of liquid is held in a horizontal circular ring,
with air on both sides of the film. A beam of light at wavelength
550 nm is directed perpendicularly onto the film, and the intensity
J of its reflection is monitored. Figure 35-47 gives intensity J as a
function of time £; the horizontal scale is set by ¢, = 20.0 s. The in-
tensity changes because of evaporation from the two sides of the
film. Assume that the film is flat and has parallel sides, a radius of
1.80 cm, and an index of refraction of 1.40. Also assume that the
film’s volume decreases at a constant rate. Find that rate.

Module 35-5 Michelson’s Interferometer

°79 If mirror M, in a Michelson interferometer (Fig. 35-21) is
moved through 0.233 mm, a shift of 792 bright fringes occurs. What
is the wavelength of the light producing the fringe pattern?

°80 A thin film with index of refraction n = 1.40 is placed in one
arm of a Michelson interferometer, perpendicular to the optical
path. If this causes a shift of 7.0 bright fringes of the pattern pro-
duced by light of wavelength 589 nm, what is the film thickness?

81 SSM WWW In Fig. 35-48,
an airtight chamber of length d =
5.0 cm is placed in one of the arms
of a Michelson interferometer. (The
glass window on each end of the cham-
ber has negligible thickness.) Light of
wavelength A=500nm is used.
Evacuating the air from the chamber
causes a shift of 60 bright fringes. From
these data and to six significant figures,
find the index of refraction of air at
atmospheric pressure.

82 The element sodium can
emit light at two wavelengths, A; =
588.9950 nm and A; = 589.5924 nm.
Light from sodium is being used in a
Michelson interferometer (Fig, 35-21). Through what distance
must mirror M, be moved if the shift in the fringe pattern for one
wavelength is to be 1.00 fringe more than the shift in the fringe pat-
tern for the other wavelength?

Additional Problems

83 © Two light rays, initially in
phase and with a wavelength of '
500 nm, go through different paths by “{
reflecting from the various mirrors 4
shown in Fig, 35-49. (Such a reflection {
does not itself produce a phase shift.)
(a) What least value of distance d will
put the rays exactly out of phase
when they emerge from the region?
(Ignore the slight tilt of the path
for ray 2.) (b) Repeat the question as-
suming that the entire apparatus is
immersed in a protein solution with
an index of refraction of 1.38.

84 © In Figure 35-50, two isotropic
point sources S; and S, emit light in
phase at wavelength A and at the
same amplitude. The sources are
separated by distance d= 6.00A
on an x axis. A viewing screen is at
distance D = 20.0A from S; and par-
allel to the y axis. The figure shows
two rays reaching point P on
the screen, at height yp. (a) At what
value of yp do the rays have the minimum possible phase differ-
ence? (b) What multiple of A gives that minimum phase differ-
ence? (c) At what value of yp do the rays have the maximum possi-
ble phase difference? What multiple of A gives (d) that maximum
phase difference and (e) the phase difference when yp = d? (f)
When yp = d, is the resulting intensity at point P maximum, mini-
