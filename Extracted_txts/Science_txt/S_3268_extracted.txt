85 SSM A double-slit arrangement produces bright interference
fringes for sodium light (a distinct yellow light at a wavelength of
A = 589 nm).The fringes are angularly separated by 0.30° near the
center of the pattern. What is the angular fringe separation if the
entire arrangement is immersed in water, which has an index of
refraction of 1.33?

86 @® In Fig. 35-51a, the waves along rays 1 and 2 are initially in
phase, with the same wavelength A in air. Ray 2 goes through a ma-
terial with length L and index of refraction n. The rays are then
reflected by mirrors to a common point P on a screen. Suppose
that we can vary n from n = 1.0 ton = 2.5. Suppose also that, from
n=1.0ton =n, = 1.5, the intensity J of the light at point P varies
with nas given in Fig. 35-51b. At what values of n greater than 1.4 is
intensity (a) maximum and (b) zero? (c) What multiple of A gives
the phase difference between the rays at point P when n = 2.0?

88 Light of wavelength 700.0 nm is sent along a route of length
2000 nm. The route is then filled with a medium having an index of
refraction of 1.400. In degrees, by how much does the medium
phase-shift the light? Give (a) the full shift and (b) the equivalent
shift that has a value less than 360°.

89 ssM In Fig. 35-53, a microwave transmitter at height a above
the water level of a wide lake transmits microwaves of wavelength
A toward a receiver on the opposite shore, a distance x above the
water level. The microwaves reflecting from the water interfere
with the microwaves arriving directly from the transmitter.

Assuming that the lake width D is much greater than a and x, and
that A = a, find an expression that gives the values of x for which
the signal at the receiver is maximum. (Hint: Does the reflection
cause a phase change?)

sources S, and S) emit light at wavelength
A= 400 nm. Source S; is located at y = 640
nm; source S) is located at y = —640 nm.

ence between the waves from the two

scale.) (b) If the waves arrive at P, with equal amplitudes, is the
interference there fully constructive, fully destructive, intermedi-
ate but closer to fully constructive,

92 Figure 35-56a shows two light rays that are initially in phase
as they travel upward through a block of plastic, with wavelength
400 nm as measured in air. Light ray r; exits directly into air.
However, before light ray r; exits into air, it travels through a liquid
in a hollow cylinder within the plastic. Initially the height Liq of the
liquid is 40.0 zm, but then the liquid begins to evaporate. Let ¢ be
the phase difference between rays r; and r, once they both exit into
the air. Figure 35-56b shows ¢ versus the liquid’s height Lig
until the liquid disappears, with ¢ given in terms of wavelength and
the horizontal scale set by L, = 40.00 um. What are (a) the index of
refraction of the plastic and (b) the index of refraction of the
liquid?
