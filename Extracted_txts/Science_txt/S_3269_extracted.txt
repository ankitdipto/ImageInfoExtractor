1080 CHAPTER 35 INTERFERENCE

94 Figure 35-57 shows an opti-
cal fiber in which a central plastic
core of index of refraction n; =
1.58 is surrounded by a plastic
sheath of index of refraction n, =
1.53. Light can travel along dif-
ferent paths within the central
core, leading to different travel times through the fiber. This causes an
initially short pulse of light to spread as it travels along the fiber,
resulting in information loss. Consider light that travels directly along
the central axis of the fiber and light that is repeatedly reflected at the
critical angle along the core—sheath interface, reflecting from side to
side as it travels down the central core. If the fiber length is 300m,
what is the difference in the travel times along these two routes?

95 ssm Two parallel slits are illuminated with monochromatic
light of wavelength 500 nm. An interference pattern is formed on a
screen some distance from the slits, and the fourth dark band is lo-
cated 1.68 cm from the central bright band on the screen. (a) What
is the path length difference corresponding to the fourth dark
band? (b) What is the distance on the screen between the central
bright band and the first bright band on either side of the central
band? (Hint: The angle to the fourth dark band and the angle to
the first bright band are small enough that tan @ ~ sin 6.)

96 A camera lens with index of refraction greater than 1.30 is
coated with a thin transparent film of index of refraction 1.25 to
eliminate by interference the reflection of light at wavelength A
that is incident perpendicularly on the lens. What multiple of A
gives the minimum film thickness needed?

97 SSM Light of wavelength A is used in a Michelson interferometer.
Let x be the position of the movable mirror, with x = 0 when the arms
have equal lengths d, = d;. Write an expression for the intensity of the
observed light as a function of x, letting /,, be the maximum intensity.

98 In two experiments, light is to be sent along the two paths
shown in Fig. 35-35 by reflecting it from the various flat surfaces
shown. In the first experiment, rays 1 and 2 are initially in phase
and have a wavelength of 620.0 nm. In the second experiment,
rays 1 and 2 are initially in phase and have a wavelength of
496.0 nm. What least value of distance L is required such that the
620.0 nm waves emerge from the region exactly in phase but the
496.0 nm waves emerge exactly out of phase?

layers where a clay armadillo is the target. The indexes of refrac-
tion of the layers are ny = 1.55, ny = 1.70, n= 1.45, ny = 1.60,
ns = 1.45, ng = 1.61, n; = 1.59, ng = 1.70, and ny = 1.60. The layer
thicknesses are either 2.00 mm or 4.00 mm, as drawn. What is the
travel time through the layers for the laser burst from (a) pistol 1,
(b) pistol 2, (c) pistol 3, and (d) pistol 4? (e) If the pistols are fired
simultaneously, which laser burst hits the target first?

100 A thin film suspended in air is 0.410 wm thick and is
illuminated with white light incident perpendicularly on its surface.
The index of refraction of the film is 1.50. At what wavelength will
visible light that is reflected from the two surfaces of the film
undergo fully constructive interference?

101 Find the slit separation of a double-slit arrangement that will
produce interference fringes 0.018 rad apart on a distant screen
when the light has wavelength A = 589 nm.

102 In aphasor diagram for any point on the viewing screen for
the two-slit experiment in Fig. 35-10, the resultant-wave phasor
rotates 60.0° in 2.50 X 10~"° s. What is the wavelength?

103 In Fig. 35-59, an oil drop (n = 1.20) floats on the surface of wa-
ter (n = 1.33) and is viewed from overhead when illuminated by sun-
light shining vertically downward and reflected vertically upward. (a)
Are the outer (thinnest) regions of the drop bright or dark? The oil
film displays several spectra of colors. (b) Move from the rim inward
to the third blue band and, using a wavelength of 475 nm for blue
light, determine the film thickness there. (c) If the oil thickness in-
creases, why do the colors gradually fade and then disappear?

104 Lloyd’ Mirror. In Fig, 35-60, mono- I A
chromatic light of wavelength A diffracts 55 —
through a narrow slit S in an otherwise h

opaque screen. On the other side, a plane mir-

ror is perpendicular to the screen and a dis- Mirror
tance h from the slit. A viewing screen A is a
distance much greater than h. (Because it sits

Figure 35-60

in a plane through the focal point of the lens,
screen A is effectively very distant. The lens Problem 104.
plays no other role in the experiment and can otherwise be neglected.)
Light that travels from the slit directly to A interferes with light from
the slit that reflects from the mirror to A. The reflection causes a half-
wavelength phase shift. (a) Is the fringe that corresponds toa zero path
length difference bright or dark? Find expres-
sions (like Eqs. 35-14 and 35-16) that locate
(b) the bright fringes and (c) the dark fringes
in the interference pattern. (Hint: Consider
the image of S produced by the mirror as seen
from a point on the viewing screen, and then
consider Young’s two-slit interference.)

105 The two point sources in Fig, 35-61
emit coherent waves. Show that all curves
(such as the one shown), over which the
phase difference for rays r; and r) is a con-
stant, are hyperbolas. (Hint: A constant phase
difference implies a constant difference in
length between r; and r>.)
