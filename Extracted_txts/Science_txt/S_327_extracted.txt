Regulatory sequences are short stretches of DNA that
function in transcriptional control but are not
transcribed themselves.

Regulatory proteins recognize and bind to specific
regulatory sequences on the DNA.

1. How do regulatory proteins
identify specific nucleotide
sequences without unwinding
the DNA?

16.2 Regulatory proteins read DNA without unwinding it.

Regulatory proteins possess structural motifs that
allow them to fit snugly into the major groove of
DNA, where the sides of the base-pairs are exposed.

Common structural motifs include the helix-turn-
helix, homeodomain, zine finger, and leucine zipper.

2. What is a helix-turn-helix
motif? What sort of
developmental events are
homeodomain motifs involved
in?

16.3 Bacteria limit transcription by blocking RNA polymerase.

 

Exploration: Reading
DNA

 

Many genes are transcriptionally regulated through
repressors, proteins that bind to the DNA at or near
the promoter and thereby inhibit transcription of the
gene.

Genes may also be transcriptionally regulated
through activators, proteins that bind to the DNA
and thereby stimulate the binding of RNA
polymerase to the promoter.

Transcription is often controlled by a combination of
repressors and activators.

3. Describe the mechanism by
which the transcription of mrp
genes is regulated in Excherichia
coli when tryptophan is present
in the environment.

4. Describe the mechanism by
which the transcription of /ac
genes is regulated in E. coli when
glucose is absent but lactose is
present in the environment.

Gene Regulation

 

330 = Part V

In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase cannot bind to the
promoter unless aided by a family of transcription
factors.

Anything that interferes with the activity of the
transcription factors can block or alter gene
expression.

Eukaryotic DNA is packaged tightly in nucleosomes
within chromosomes. This packaging appears to
provide some inhibition of transcription, although
regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase can still
activate specific genes even when they are so

packaged.

Gene expression can also be regulated at the
posttranscriptional level, through RNA splicing,
translation repressor proteins, and the selective
degradation of mRNA transcripts.

Molecular Genetics

5. How do transcription factors
promote transcription in
eukaryotic cells? How do the
enhancers of eukaryotic cells
differ from most regulatory sites
on bacterial DNA?

6. What role does the
methylation of DNA likely play
in transcriptional control?

7. How does the primary RNA
transcript of a eukaryotic gene
differ from the mRNA transcript
of that gene as it is translated in
the cytoplasm?

8. How can a eukaryotic cell
control the translation of mRNA.
transcripts after they have been
transported from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm?
