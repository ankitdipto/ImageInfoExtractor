Photos. Figure 36-16a shows an actual pattern in which both double-slit
interference and diffraction are evident. If one slit is covered, the single-slit
diffraction pattern of Fig. 36-16b results. Note the correspondence between
Figs. 36-16a and 36-15c, and between Figs. 36-16b and 36-15b. In comparing
these figures, bear in mind that Fig. 36-16 has been deliberately overexposed to
bring out the faint secondary maxima and that several secondary maxima
(rather than one) are shown.

Intensity. With diffraction effects taken into account, the intensity of a double-
slit interference pattern is given by

i 2
1(6) = In(cos?B) (22) (double sit, (36-19)

oo ad
in which B= > sin @ (36-20)
and a= = sin 6. (36-21)

Here d is the distance between the centers of the slits and a is the slit width. Note
carefully that the right side of Eq. 36-19 is the product of J,,, and two factors. (1) The
interference factor cos? Bis due to the interference between two slits with slit separa-
tion d (as given by Eqs. 35-22 and 35-23). (2) The diffraction factor [(sin a)/a}? is due
to diffraction by a single slit of width a (as given by Eqs. 36-5 and 36-6).

Let us check these factors. If we let a > 0 in Eq. 36-21, for example, then
a— Oand (sin a)/a — 1. Equation 36-19 then reduces, as it must, to an equation
describing the interference pattern for a pair of vanishingly narrow slits with slit
separation d. Similarly, putting d = 0 in Eq. 36-20 is equivalent physically to caus-
ing the two slits to merge into a single slit of width a. Then Eq. 36-20 yields B = 0
and cos” 6 = 1. In this case Eq. 36-19 reduces, as it must, to an equation describing
the diffraction pattern for a single slit of width a.

Language. The double-slit pattern described by Eq. 36-19 and displayed in Fig.
36-16a combines interference and diffraction in an intimate way. Both are superpo-
sition effects, in that they result from the combining of waves with different phases
at a given point. If the combining waves originate from a small number of elemen-
tary coherent sources—as in a double-slit experiment with a < A—we call the
