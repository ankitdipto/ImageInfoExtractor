36-4 DIFFRACTION BY A DOUBLE SLIT 1097

process interference. If the combining waves originate in a single wavefront—as in
a single-slit experiment—we call the process diffraction. This distinction between
interference and diffraction (which is somewhat arbitrary and not always adhered
to) is a convenient one, but we should not forget that both are superposition
effects and usually both are present simultaneously (as in Fig. 36-16a).

Sample Problem 36.05 Double-slit experiment with diffraction of each slit included

In a double-slit experiment, the wavelength A of the light
source is 405 nm, the slit separation d is 19.44 wm, and the
slit width a is 4.050 um. Consider the interference of the
light from the two slits and also the diffraction of the light
through each slit.

(a) How many bright interference fringes are within the
central peak of the diffraction envelope?

KEY IDEAS

 

We first analyze the two basic mechanisms responsible for
the optical pattern produced in the experiment:

1. Single-slit diffraction: The limits of the central peak are
the first minima in the diffraction pattern due to either slit
individually. (See Fig. 36-15.) The angular locations of
those minima are given by Eq. 36-3 (a sin @ = mA). Here
let us rewrite this equation as a sin @=m,A, with the
subscript 1 referring to the one-slit diffraction. For the first
minima in the diffraction pattern, we substitute m, = 1,
obtaining

asin = A. (36-22)

2. Double-slit interference: The angular locations of the
bright fringes of the double-slit interference pattern are
given by Eq. 35-14, which we can write as

dsin 0= mA, form, = 0,1,2,.... (36-23)

Here the subscript 2 refers to the double-slit interference.

Calculations: We can locate the first diffraction minimum
within the double-slit fringe pattern by dividing Eq. 36-23 by
Eg. 36-22 and solving for mp. By doing so and then substitut-
ing the given data, we obtain

a 4.050 um
This tells us that the bright interference fringe for m) = 4
fits into the central peak of the one-slit diffraction pattern,
but the fringe for mm = 5 does not fit. Within the central dif-
fraction peak we have the central bright fringe (sm = 0),
and four bright fringes (up to m, = 4) on each side of it.
Thus, a total of nine bright fringes of the double-slit interfer-
ence pattern are within the central peak of the diffraction

48.

fringe are shown in Fig. 36-17.

(b) How many bright fringes are within either of the first
side peaks of the diffraction envelope?

KEY IDEA

 

The outer limits of the first side diffraction peaks are the
second diffraction minima, each of which is at the angle 0
given by asin = mA with m, = 2:

asin 0= 2A. (36-24)

Calculation: Dividing Eq. 36-23 by Eq. 36-24, we find

This tells us that the second diffraction minimum occurs just
before the bright interference fringe for m) = 10 in Eq. 36-23.
Within either first side diffraction peak we have the fringes
from m, = 5 to m, = 9, for a total of five bright fringes of
the double-slit interference pattern (shown in the inset of
Fig. 36-17). However, if the m = 5 bright fringe, which is al-
most eliminated by the first diffraction minimum, is consid-
ered too dim to count, then only four bright fringes are in
the first side diffraction peak.
