1100 CHAPTER 36 DIFFRACTION

We state without proof that the half-width of any other line depends on its loca-
tion relative to the central axis and is

Abe = (half-width of line at 6). (36-28)

Note that for light of a given wavelength A and a given ruling separation d, the
widths of the lines decrease with an increase in the number N of rulings. Thus, of
two diffraction gratings, the grating with the larger value of N is better able to
distinguish between wavelengths because its diffraction lines are narrower and so
produce less overlap.

Grating Spectroscope

Diffraction gratings are widely used to determine the wavelengths that are emit-
ted by sources of light ranging from lamps to stars. Figure 36-23 shows a simple
grating spectroscope in which a grating is used for this purpose. Light from
source S is focused by lens L; ona vertical slit 5; placed in the focal plane of lens
L». The light emerging from tube C (called a collimator) is a plane wave and is
incident perpendicularly on grating G, where it is diffracted into a diffraction
pattern, with the m = 0 order diffracted at angle @= 0 along the central axis of
the grating.

We can view the diffraction pattern that would appear on a viewing screen at
any angle @simply by orienting telescope T in Fig. 36-23 to that angle. Lens L; of
the telescope then focuses the light diffracted at angle 6 (and at slightly smaller
and larger angles) onto a focal plane FF’ within the telescope. When we look
through eyepiece E, we see a magnified view of this focused image.

By changing the angle @ of the telescope, we can examine the entire diffraction
pattern. For any order number other than m = 0, the original light is spread out ac-
cording to wavelength (or color) so that we can determine, with Eq. 36-25, just what

shorter-wavelength line at a smaller angle 6 than the longer-wavelength line.

Hydrogen. For example, the light emitted by a hydrogen lamp, which con-
tains hydrogen gas, has four discrete wavelengths in the visible range. If our eyes
intercept this light directly, it appears to be white. If, instead, we view it through a
grating spectroscope, we can distinguish, in several orders, the lines of the four
colors corresponding to these visible wavelengths. (Such lines are called emission
lines.) Four orders are represented in Fig. 36-24. In the central order (m = 0), the
lines corresponding to all four wavelengths are superimposed, giving a single
white line at @ = 0.The colors are separated in the higher orders.

The third order is not shown in Fig. 36-24 for the sake of clarity; it actually
overlaps the second and fourth orders. The fourth-order red line is missing
because it is not formed by the grating used here. That is, when we attempt to
