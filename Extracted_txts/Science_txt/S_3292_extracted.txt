Dispersion and Resolving Power Compared

The resolving power of a grating must not be confused with its dispersion.
Table 36-1 shows the characteristics of three gratings, all illuminated with light of
wavelength A = 589 nm, whose diffracted light is viewed in the first order (m = 1
in Eq. 36-25). You should verify that the values of D and R as given in the table
can be calculated with Eqs. 36-30 and 36-32, respectively. (In the calculations for
D, you will need to convert radians per meter to degrees per micrometer.)

For the conditions noted in Table 36-1, gratings A and B have the same
dispersion D and A and C have the same resolving power R.

Figure 36-26 shows the intensity patterns (also called line shapes) that would
be produced by these gratings for two lines of wavelengths A, and Aj, in the
vicinity of A = 589 nm. Grating B, with the higher resolving power, produces
narrower lines and thus is capable of distinguishing lines that are much closer
together in wavelength than those in the figure. Grating C, with the higher dis-
persion, produces the greater angular separation between the lines.
