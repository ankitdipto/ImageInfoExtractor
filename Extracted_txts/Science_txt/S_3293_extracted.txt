1104 CHAPTER 36 DIFFRACTION

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The angular separation A@ between the two lines in the
first order depends on their wavelength difference AA and
the dispersion D of the grating, according to Eq. 36-29
(D = A@AA). (2) The dispersion D depends on the angle 6
at which it is to be evaluated.

Calculations: We can assume that, in the first order, the
two sodium lines occur close enough to each other for us to
evaluate D at the angle @ = 16.99° we found in part (a) for
one of those lines. Then Eq. 36-30 gives the dispersion as

p=—@™_= i
dcos@ (2016 nm)(cos 16.99°)

= 5.187 X 10-4 rad/nm.
From Eq. 36-29 and with AA in nanometers, we then have
A@= DAA = (5.187 x 10-4 rad/nm) (589.59 — 589.00)
= 3.06 x 10-4 rad = 0.0175°. (Answer)

‘You can show that this result depends on the grating spacing
d but not on the number of rulings there are in the grating.

(c) What is the least number of rulings a grating can have
and still be able to resolve the sodium doublet in the first
order?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The resolving power of a grating in any order m is physi-
cally set by the number of rulings N in the grating
according to Eq. 36-32 (R = Nm). (2) The smallest wave-
length difference AA that can be resolved depends on the
average wavelength involved and on the resolving power R
of the grating, according to Eq. 36-31 (R = Aayg/AA).

Calculation: For the sodium doublet to be barely resolved,
AA must be their wavelength separation of 0.59 nm, and Ajys
must be their average wavelength of 589.30 nm. Thus, we
find that the smallest number of rulings for a grating to
resolve the sodium doublet is

36-7 X-RAY DIFFRACTION

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

36.38 Identify approximately where x rays are located in the
electromagnetic spectrum.

36.39 Define a unit cell.

36.40 Define reflecting planes (or crystal planes) and
interplanar spacing.

36.41 Sketch two rays that scatter from adjacent planes,
showing the angle that is used in calculations.

Key Ideas

@ Ifx rays are directed toward a crystal structure, they
undergo Bragg scattering, which is easiest to visualize if
the crystal atoms are considered to be in parallel planes.

@ For x rays of wavelength A scattering from crystal planes

36.42 For the intensity maxima in x-ray scattering
by a crystal, apply the relationship between the
interplanar spacing d, the angle @ of scattering,
the order number m, and the wavelength A of the
x rays.

36.43 Given a drawing of a unit cell, demonstrate how an
interplanar spacing can be determined.

with separation d, the angles @ at which the scattered
intensity is maximum are given by

X-Ray Diffraction

X rays are electromagnetic radiation whose wavelengths are of the order of 1A
(= 10" m). Compare this with a wavelength of 550 nm (= 5.5 x 1077 m) at the
