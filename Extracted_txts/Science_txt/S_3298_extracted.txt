opening, which has a horizontal
width of 30.0 cm, faces a wall 100m
away (Fig, 36-36). Along that wall,
how far from the central axis will a

°°9 SSM ILW Aslit 1.00 mm wide is illuminated by light of wave-
length 589 nm. We see a diffraction pattern on a screen 3.00m
away. What is the distance between the first two diffraction minima
on the same side of the central diffraction maximum?

*°10 @ Manufacturers of wire (and other objects of small
dimension) sometimes use a laser to continually monitor the
thickness of the product. The wire intercepts the laser beam, pro-
ducing a diffraction pattern like that of a single slit of the same
width as the wire diameter (Fig. 36-37). Suppose a helium—neon
laser, of wavelength 632.8 nm, illuminates a wire, and the diffrac-
tion pattern appears on a screen at distance L = 2.60 m. If the
desired wire diameter is 1.37 mm, what is the observed distance
between the two tenth-order minima (one on each side of the
central maximum)?

Module 36-2 Intensity in Single-Slit Diffraction

11 A 0.10-mm-wide slit is illuminated by light of wavelength
589 nm. Consider a point P on a viewing screen on which the dif-
fraction pattern of the slit is viewed; the point is at 30° from the
central axis of the slit. What is the phase difference between the
Huygens wavelets arriving at point P from the top and midpoint of
the slit? (Hint: See Eq. 36-4.)

fraction experiment using light of wavelength 610 nm. The vertical axis

(a) the slit width, (b) the total num-
ber of diffraction minima in the pat-
tern (count them on both sides of
the center of the diffraction pat-
tern), (c) the least angle for a mini- sin@
mum, and (d) the greatest angle for 05 1

*13 Monochromatic light with wavelength 538 nm is incident on a
slit with width 0.025 mm. The distance from the slit to a screen is 3.5
m. Consider a point on the screen 1.1 cm from the central maximum.
Calculate (a) @for that point, (b) a, and (c) the ratio of the intensity at
that point to the intensity at the central maximum.

14 Inthe single-slit diffraction experiment of Fig. 36-4, let the wave-
length of the light be 500 nm, the slit width be 6.00 wm, and the view-
ing screen be at distance D = 3.00m. Let a y axis extend upward
along the viewing screen, with its origin at the center of the diffraction
pattern. Also let Jp represent the intensity of the diffracted light at
point P at y = 15.0 cm. (a) Whatis the ratio of Jp to the intensity J, at
the center of the pattern? (b) Determine where point P is in the dif-
fraction pattern by giving the maximum and minimum between
which it lies, or the two minima between which it lies.

“15 SSM WWW The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a
central diffraction maximum is defined as the angle between the two
points in the pattem where the intensity is one-half that at the center
of the pattem. (See Fig. 36-8.) (a) Show that the intensity drops to
one-half the maximum value when sin? a = @/2. (b) Verify that a=
1.39 rad (about 80°) is a solution to the transcendental equation of
(a).(c) Show that the FWHM is A = 2 sin-!(0.443A/a), where ais the

Point P lies in the geometrical — x ——»—_______,

fracting objects, shown in Fig.

the collimating hole. Object A is @

an opaque circle with a hole in
it, and B is the “photographic
negative” of A. Using superpo-
sition concepts, show that the
intensity at P is identical for the
two diffracting objects A and B.

°°17 (a) Show that the values
of @ at which intensity maxima
for single-slit diffraction occur can be found exactly by differenti-
ating Eq. 36-5 with respect to a and equating the result to zero, ob-
taining the condition tan a = a.To find values of a satisfying this
relation, plot the curve y = tan a and the straight line y = a and
then find their intersections, or use a calculator to find an appro-
priate value of a by trial and error. Next, from a = (m + 5)z, de-
termine the values of m associated with the maxima in the single-
slit pattern. (These m values are not integers because secondary
maxima do not lie exactly halfway between minima.) What are the
(b) smallest @ and (c) associated m, the (d) second smallest a and
(e) associated m, and the (f) third smallest «and (g) associated m?
