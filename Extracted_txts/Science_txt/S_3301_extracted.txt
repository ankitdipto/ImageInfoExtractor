central diffraction envelope?

°38 Ina certain two-slit interference pattern, 10 bright fringes lie

the ratio of the slit separation to the slit width?

Module 36-5 Diffraction Gratings

°44 <= Perhaps to confuse a predator, some tropical gyrinid
beetles (whirligig beetles) are colored by optical interference that
is due to scales whose alignment forms a diffraction grating (which
scatters light instead of transmitting it). When the incident light
rays are perpendicular to the grating, the angle between the first-
order maxima (on opposite sides of the zeroth-order maximum) is
about 26° in light with a wavelength of 550 nm. What is the grating
spacing of the beetle?

°45 A diffraction grating 20.0 mm wide has 6000 rulings. Light of
wavelength 589 nm is incident perpendicularly on the grating.
What are the (a) largest, (b) second largest, and (c) third largest
values of @ at which maxima appear on a distant viewing screen?

*46 Visible light is incident perpendicularly on a grating with 315
rulings/mm. What is the longest wavelength that can be seen in the
fifth-order diffraction?

°47 SSM ILW A grating has 400 lines/mm. How many orders of
the entire visible spectrum (400-700 nm) can it produce in a dif-
fraction experiment, in addition to the m = 0 order?

48 A diffraction grating is made up of slits of width 300 nm with
separation 900 nm. The grating is illuminated by monochromatic
plane waves of wavelength A= 600nm at normal incidence.
(a) How many maxima are there in the full diffraction pattern?
(b) What is the angular width of a spectral line observed in the first
order if the grating has 1000 slits?

49 SSM WWW Light of wavelength 600 nm is incident normally
on a diffraction grating. Two adjacent maxima occur at angles given
by sin @= 0.2 and sin @ = 0.3. The fourth-order maxima are missing.
(a) What is the separation between adjacent slits? (b) What is the
smallest slit width this grating can have? For that slit width, what are
the (c) largest, (d) second largest, and (e) third largest values of the
order number m of the maxima produced by the grating?

50 With light from a gaseous discharge tube incident normally
on a grating with slit separation 1.73 wm, sharp maxima of green
light are experimentally found at angles @ = £17.6°,37.3°, —37.1°,
65.2°, and —65.0°. Compute the wavelength of the green light that
best fits these data.

51 © A diffraction grating having 180 lines/mm is illuminated
with a light signal containing only two wavelengths, A; = 400 nm
and A = 500nm. The signal is incident perpendicularly on the
grating. (a) What is the angular separation between the second-
order maxima of these two wavelengths? (b) What is the smallest
angle at which two of the resulting maxima are superimposed?
(c) What is the highest order for which maxima for both wave-
lengths are present in the diffraction pattern?

52 © A beam of light consisting of wavelengths from
460.0 nm to 640.0 nm is directed perpendicularly onto a diffrac-
tion grating with 160 lines/mm. (a) What is the lowest order that is
overlapped by another order? (b) What is the highest order for
which the complete wavelength range of the beam is present? In
that highest order, at what angle does the light at wavelength (c)
460.0 nm and (d) 640.0 nm appear? (e) What is the greatest angle
at which the light at wavelength 460.0 nm appears?
