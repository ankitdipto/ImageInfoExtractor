°55 SSM ILW A source containing a mixture of hydrogen and
deuterium atoms emits red light at two wavelengths whose mean is
656.3 nm and whose separation is 0.180 nm. Find the minimum
number of lines needed in a diffraction grating that can resolve
these lines in the first order.

*56 (a) How many rulings must a 4,00-cm-wide diffraction grating
have to resolve the wavelengths 415.496 and 415.487 nm in the second
order? (b) At what angle are the second-order maxima found?

°57 Light at wavelength 589 nm from a sodium lamp is incident per-
pendicularly on a grating with 40 000 rulings over width 76 nm. What
are the first-order (a) dispersion D and (b) resolving power R, the sec-
ond-order (c) D and (d) R,and the third-order (e) D and (f) R?

*58 A grating has 600 rulings/mm and is 5.0 mm wide. (a) What is
the smallest wavelength interval it can resolve in the third order at
A = 500 nm? (b) How many higher orders of maxima can be seen?

°59 A diffraction grating with a width of 2.0cm contains
1000 lines/em across that width. For an incident wavelength of
600 nm, what is the smallest wavelength difference this grating can
resolve in the second order?

°60 The D line in the spectrum of sodium is a doublet with wave-
lengths 589.0 and 589.6nm. Calculate the minimum number
of lines needed in a grating that will resolve this doublet in the
second-order spectrum.

°61 With a particular grating the sodium doublet (589.00 nm and
589.59 nm) is viewed in the third order at 10° to the normal and is
barely resolved. Find (a) the grating spacing and (b) the total width
of the rulings.

62 A diffraction grating illuminated by monochromatic light
normal to the grating produces a certain line at angle . (a) What is
the product of that line’s half-width and the grating’s resolving
power? (b) Evaluate that product for the first order of a grating of
slit separation 900 nm in light of wavelength 600 nm.

°°63 Assume that the limits of the visible spectrum are arbitrarily
chosen as 430 and 680 nm. Calculate the number of rulings per mil-
limeter of a grating that will spread the first-order spectrum
through an angle of 20.0°.

Module 36-7 X-Ray Diffraction

°64 What is the smallest Bragg angle for x rays of wavelength
30 pm to reflect from reflecting planes spaced 0.30 nm apart in a
calcite crystal?

°65 An x-ray beam of wavelength A undergoes first-order reflection
(Bragg law diffraction) from a crystal when its angle of incidence to a
crystal face is 23°, and an x-ray beam of wavelength 97 pm undergoes
third-order reflection when its angle of incidence to that face is 60°.
Assuming that the two beams reflect from the same family of reflecting
planes, find (a) the interplanar spacing and (b) the wavelength A.
