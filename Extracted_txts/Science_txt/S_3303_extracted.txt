Additional Problems

74 An astronaut in a space shuttle claims she can just barely re-
solve two point sources on Earth’s surface, 160km_ below.
Calculate their (a) angular and (b) linear separation, assuming
ideal conditions. Take A = 540 nm and the pupil diameter of the as-
tronaut’s eye to be 5.0 mm.

75 SSM Visible light is incident perpendicularly on a diffraction
grating of 200 rulings/mm. What are the (a) longest, (b) second
longest, and (c) third longest wavelengths that can be associated
with an intensity maximum at @ = 30.0°?

76 A beam of light consists of two wavelengths, 590.159 nm and
590.220 nm, that are to be resolved with a diffraction grating. If the
grating has lines across a width of 3.80 cm, what is the minimum
number of lines required for the two wavelengths to be resolved in
the second order?

77 ssM In a single-slit diffraction experiment, there is a mini-
mum of intensity for orange light (A = 600 nm) and a minimum of
intensity for blue-green light (A = 500 nm) at the same angle of
1.00 mrad. For what minimum slit width is this possible?

78 ® A double-slit system with individual slit widths of 0.030 mm
and aslit separation of 0.18 mm is illuminated with 500 nm light di-
rected perpendicular to the plane of the slits. What is the total
number of complete bright fringes appearing between the two
first-order minima of the diffraction pattern? (Do not count the
fringes that coincide with the minima of the diffraction pattern.)

79 SSM A diffraction grating has resolving power R = Agyj/AA =
Nm. (a) Show that the corresponding frequency range Af that can
just be resolved is given by Af= c/Nma. (b) From Fig, 36-22, show
that the times required for light to travel along the ray at the bot-
tom of the figure and the ray at the top differ by At = (Nd/c) siné.
(c) Show that (Af)(Ar) = 1, this relation being independent of the
various grating parameters. Assume N > 1.

80 The pupil of a person’s eye has a diameter of 5.00 mm.
According to Rayleigh’s criterion, what distance apart must two
small objects be if their images are just barely resolved when they
are 250 mm from the eye? Assume they are illuminated with light
of wavelength 500 nm.

Show that bright fringes occur at angles @that satisfy the equation
a(sin y+ sin #) =mA, form =0,1,2

(Compare this equation with Eq. 36-25.) Only the special case
w = Ohas been treated in this chapter.

82 A grating with d = 1.50 um is illuminated at various angles of
incidence by light of wavelength 600 nm. Plot, as a function of the
angle of incidence (0 to 90°), the angular deviation of the first-
order maximum from the incident direction. (See Problem 81.)

 

 

83 ssM In two-slit interference, if the slit separation is 14 wm and
the slit widths are each 2.0 ym, (a) how many two-slit maxima are
in the central peak of the diffraction envelope and (b) how many
are in either of the first side peak of the diffraction envelope?

84 © Ina two-slit interference pattern, what is the ratio of slit
separation to slit width if there are 17 bright fringes within the cen-
tral diffraction envelope and the diffraction minima coincide with
two-slit interference maxima?

85 A beam of light with a narrow wavelength range centered on
450 nm is incident perpendicularly on a diffraction grating with a
width of 1.80cm and a line density of 1400 lines/cm across that
width. For this light, what is the smallest wavelength difference this
grating can resolve in the third order?

86 If you look at something 40 m from you, what is the smallest
length (perpendicular to your line of sight) that you can resolve,
according to Rayleigh’s criterion? Assume the pupil of your eye
has a diameter of 4.00 mm, and use 500 nm as the wavelength of
the light reaching you.

87 Two yellow flowers are separated by 60 cm along a line per-
pendicular to your line of sight to the flowers. How far are you
from the flowers when they are at the limit of resolution accord-
ing to the Rayleigh criterion? Assume the light from the flowers
has a single wavelength of 550 nm and that your pupil has a diam-
eter of 5.5 mm.

88 Ina single-slit diffraction experiment, what must be the ratio
of the slit width to the wavelength if the second diffraction minima
are to occur at an angle of 37.0° from the center of the diffraction
pattern on a viewing screen?

89 A diffraction grating 3.00 cm wide produces the second order
at 33.0° with light of wavelength 600 nm. What is the total number
of lines on the grating?

90 A single-slit diffraction experiment is set up with light of
wavelength 420 nm, incident perpendicularly on a slit of width
5.10 um. The viewing screen is 3.20 m distant. On the screen, what
is the distance between the center of the diffraction pattern and
the second diffraction minimum?

91 A diffraction grating has 8900 slits across 1.20 cm. If light with
a wavelength of 500 nm is sent through it, how many orders (max-
ima) lie to one side of the central maximum?

92 In an experiment to monitor the Moon’s surface with a light
beam, pulsed radiation from a ruby laser (A = 0.69 um) was di-
rected to the Moon through a reflecting telescope with a mirror ra-
dius of 1.3 m. A reflector on the Moon behaved like a circular flat
mirror with radius 10 cm, reflecting the light directly back toward
the telescope on Earth. The reflected light was then detected after
being brought to a focus by this telescope. Approximately what
fraction of the original light energy was picked up by the detector?
Assume that for each direction of travel all the energy is in the cen-
tral diffraction peak.
