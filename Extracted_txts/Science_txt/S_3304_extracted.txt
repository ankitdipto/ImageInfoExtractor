93 In June 1985, a laser beam was sent out from the Air Force
Optical Station on Maui, Hawaii, and reflected back from the shuttle
Discovery as it sped by 354 km overhead. The diameter of the central
maximum of the beam at the shuttle position was said to be 9.1m,
and the beam wavelength was 500 nm. What is the effective diameter
of the laser aperture at the Maui ground station? (Hint: A laser beam
spreads only because of diffraction; assume a circular exit aperture.)

94 A diffraction grating 1.00 cm wide has 10 000 parallel slits.
Monochromatic light that is incident normally is diffracted
through 30° in the first order. What is the wavelength of the light?

95 ssM If you double the width of a single slit, the intensity of
the central maximum of the diffraction pattern increases by a
factor of 4, even though the energy passing through the slit only
doubles. Explain this quantitatively.

96 When monochromatic light is incident on a slit 22.0 wm wide,
the first diffraction minimum lies at 1.80° from the direction of the
incident light. What is the wavelength?

97 Aspy satellite orbiting at 160 km above Earth’s surface has alens
with a focal length of 3.6 m and can resolve objects on the ground as
small as 30 cm. For example, it can easily measure the size of an air-
craft’s air intake port. What is the effective diameter of the lens as de-
termined by diffraction consideration alone? Assume A = 550 nm.

98 Suppose that two points are separated by 2.0 cm. If they are
viewed by an eye with a pupil opening of 5.0 mm, what distance
from the viewer puts them at the Rayleigh limit of resolution?
Assume a light wavelength of 500 nm.

99 A diffraction grating has 200 lines/mm. Light consisting of a
continuous range of wavelengths between 550 nm and 700 nm is
incident perpendicularly on the grating. (a) What is the lowest or-
der that is overlapped by another order? (b) What is the highest
order for which the complete spectrum is present?

100 A diffraction grating has 200 rulings/mm, and it produces an in-
tensity maximum at @ = 30.0°. (a) What are the possible wavelengths
of the incident visible light? (b) To what colors do they correspond?

101 SSM Show that the dispersion of a grating is D = (tan 6)/A.

102 Monochromatic light (wavelength = 450 nm) is incident per-
pendicularly on a single slit (width = 0.40 mm). A screen is placed
parallel to the slit plane, and on it the distance between the two
minima on either side of the central maximum is 1.8 mm. (a) What
is the distance from the slit to the screen? (Hint: The angle to ei-
ther minimum is small enough that sin @ ~tan 6.) (b) What is the
distance on the screen between the first minimum and the third
minimum on the same side of the central maximum?

103 Light containing a mixture of two wavelengths, 500 and
600 nm, is incident normally on a diffraction grating. It is desired
(1) that the first and second maxima for each wavelength appear at
@ = 30°, (2) that the dispersion be as high as possible, and (3) that
the third order for the 600 nm light be a missing order. (a) What
should be the slit separation? (b) What is the smallest individual
slit width that can be used? (c) For the values calculated in (a) and
(b) and the light of wavelength 600 nm, what is the largest order of
maxima produced by the grating?

104 A beam of x rays with wavelengths ranging from 0.120 nm to
0.0700 nm scatters from a family of reflecting planes in a crystal.
The plane separation is 0.250 nm. It is observed that scattered
beams are produced for 0.100 nm and 0.0750 nm. What is the angle
between the incident and scattered beams?

105 Show that a grating made up of alternately transparent and
opaque strips of equal width eliminates all the even orders of max-
ima (except m = 0).

106 Light of wavelength 500 nm diffracts through a slit of width
2.00 wm and onto a screen that is 2.00 m away. On the screen, what
is the distance between the center of the diffraction pattern and
the third diffraction minimum?

107 If,in atwo-slit interference pattern, there are 8 bright fringes
within the first side peak of the diffraction envelope and diffrac-
tion minima coincide with two-slit interference maxima, then what
is the ratio of slit separation to slit width?

113 An acoustic double-slit system (of slit separation d and
slit width a) is driven by two loudspeakers as shown in Fig. 36-51. By
use of a variable delay line, the phase of one of the speakers may be
varied relative to the other speaker. Describe in detail what changes
occur in the double-slit diffraction pattern at large distances as the
phase difference between the speakers is varied from zero to 27.
