3. The distance traveled by the kaon between those two
events is related to its speed v and the time interval for
the travel by

dist
ee (37-10)
time interval

With these ideas in mind, let us solve for the distance first

with classical physics and then with special relativity.

Classical physics: In classical physics we would find the
same distance and time interval (in Eq. 37-10) whether we
measured them from the kaon frame or from the laboratory
frame. Thus, we need not be careful about the frame in
which the measurements are made. To find the kaon’s travel
distance d,, according to classical physics, we first rewrite
Eq. 37-10 as

dey =v At, (37-11)

where Af is the time interval between the two events in
either frame. Then, substituting 0.990c for v and 0.1237 ys
for Atin Eq. 37-11, we find

dey = (0.990c) At
= (0.990)(299 792.458 m/s)(0.1237 x 10-*s)
= 36.7 m. (Answer)

This is how far the kaon would travel if classical physics
were correct at speeds close to c.

Special relativity: In special relativity we must be very care-
ful that both the distance and the time interval in Eq. 37-10 are
measured in the same reference frame—especially when the
speed is close to c, as here. Thus, to find the actual travel dis-

tance d,, of the kaon as measured from the laboratory frame
and according to special relativity, we rewrite Eq.37-10 as

dg =v At, (37-12)

where At is the time interval between the two events as
measured from the laboratory frame.

Before we can evaluate d,, in Eq. 37-12, we must find
At. The 0.1237 ys time interval is a proper time because the
two events occur at the same location in the kaon frame—.
namely, at the kaon itself. Therefore, let Af) represent this
proper time interval. Then we can use Eq. 37-9 (At = y Af)
for time dilation to find the time interval Ar as measured
from the laboratory frame. Using Eq. 37-8 to substitute for
yin Eq.37-9 leads to

Ab 0.1237 x 10-6 s

aa V1 — (vic)? - V1 — (0.990c/e)?

This is about seven times longer than the kaon’s proper
lifetime. That is, the kaon’s lifetime is about seven times
longer in the laboratory frame than in its own frame—the
kaon’s lifetime is dilated. We can now evaluate Eq. 37-12
for the travel distance d,, in the laboratory frame as

d., = v At = (0.990c) At
(0.990) (299 792 458 m/s)(8.769 x 1077s)

= 260 m. (Answer)
‘This is about seven times d.,. Experiments like the one outlined
here, which verify special relativity, became routine in physics
laboratories decades ago. The engineering design and the con-

struction of any scientific or medical facility that employs high-
speed particles must take relativity into account.

are entangled, measurements of the lengths of objects

may be different in two frames with relative motion.

proper length.

Key Ideas

@ The length Lo of an object measured by an observer in an
inertial reference frame in which the object is at rest is called
its proper length. Observers in frames moving relative to that
frame and parallel to that length will always measure a shorter
length, an effect known as length contraction.

@ If the relative speed between frames is v, the contracted

37.13 Identify that if a length is a proper length as measured
in one frame, the length is less (contracted) as measured in
another frame that is in relative motion parallel to the length.

37.14 Apply the relationship between contracted length L, proper
length Lo, and the relative speed v between two frames.

length L and the proper length Ly are related by
L=lLy)V1-£B= to
Y

where £ = vic is the speed parameter and y = 1/1 — Bis
the Lorentz factor.
