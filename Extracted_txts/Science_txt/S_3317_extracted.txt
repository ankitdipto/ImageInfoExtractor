1128 CHAPTER 37 RELATIVITY

‘We do not know L, but we can relate it to the given Lo:
The distance between the two events as measured from Sam’s
frame is the ship’s proper length Lo. Thus, the distance L
measured from Sally’s frame must be less than Lo, as given by
Eq. 37-13 (L = Lp/y) for length contraction. Substituting Lo/y
for L in Eq.37-18 and then substituting Eq. 37-8 for y, we find

Loly _ LoV (1 = (vic?

Solving this equation for v (notice that it is on the left and
also buried in the Lorentz factor) leads us to

= 0.210c. (Answer)

Note that only the relative motion of Sally and Sam

matters here; whether either is stationary relative to, say, a
space station is irrelevant. In Figs. 37-8a and b we took
Sally to be stationary, but we could instead have taken
the ship to be stationary, with Sally moving to the left
past it. Event 1 is again when Sally and point B are aligned
(Fig. 37-8c), and event 2 is again when Sally and point C
are aligned (Fig. 37-8d). However, we are now using Sam’s
measurements. So the length between the two events in his
frame is the proper length Lo of the ship and the time in-
terval between them is not Sally’s measurement Af but a
dilated time interval y At.

Substituting Sam’s measurements into Eq. 37-17, we have

Lo
yAt

which is exactly what we found using Sally’s measurements.
Thus, we get the same result of v = 0.210c with either set of
measurements, but we must be careful not to mix the mea-
surements from the two frames.

Sample Problem 37.04 Time dilation and length contraction in outrunning a supernova

Caught by surprise near a supernova, you race away from the
explosion in your spaceship, hoping to outrun the high-speed
material ejected toward you. Your Lorentz factor y relative
to the inertial reference frame of the local stars is 22.4.

(a) To reach a safe distance, you figure you need to cover
9.00 x 10'° m as measured in the reference frame of the local
stars. How long will the flight take, as measured in that frame?

KEY IDEAS

 

From Chapter 2, for constant speed, we know that

distance

speed = (37-19)

time interval *
From Fig. 37-6, we see that because your Lorentz factor y
relative to the stars is 22.4 (large), your relative speed v is
almost c—so close that we can approximate it as c. Then for
speed v ~ c, we must be careful that the distance and the
time interval in Eq. 37-19 are measured in the same refer-
ence frame.

Calculations: The given distance (9.00 x 10!° m) for the
length of your travel path is measured in the reference
frame of the stars, and the requested time interval Af is to be
measured in that same frame. Thus, we can write

( time interval )- distance relative to stars
relative to stars ) — c °

Then substituting the given distance, we find that
time interval \__ 9.00 x 10'°m
relative to stars / 299 792 458 m/s

3.00 x 108s = 9.51 y.

(b) How long does that trip take according to you (in your
reference frame)?

KEY IDEAS

 

1. We now want the time interval measured in a different
reference frame—namelly, yours. Thus, we need to trans-
form the data given in the reference frame of the stars to
your frame.

2. The given path length of 9.00 x 10'¢ m, measured in the
reference frame of the stars, is a proper length Lo, be-
cause the two ends of the path are at rest in that frame.
As observed from your reference frame, the stars’ refer-
ence frame and those two ends of the path race past you
ata relative speed of v ~ c.

3. You measure a contracted length Lo/y for the path, not
the proper length Lo.

Calculations: We can now rewrite Eq. 37-19 as
Loly

( time interval ) _ distance relative to you _
c a

relative to you
Substituting known data, we find

( time interval ) — (9.00 x 10" m)/22.4
299 792 458 m/s

relative to you
1.340 x 107s = 0.425 y. (Answer)

In part (a) we found that the flight takes 9.51 y in the refer-
ence frame of the stars. However, here we find that it takes
only 0.425 y in your frame, due to the relative motion and
the resulting contracted length of the path.
