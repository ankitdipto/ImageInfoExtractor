Suppose the rod is moving in frame S. This means that Ax can be identified as

the length L of the rod in frame S onl

 

 

f the coordinates of the rod’s end points

 

are measured simultaneously — that is, if At = 0. If we put Ax’ = Lo, Ax = L,and
At = 0 in Eq. 37-25, we find

(37-26)

(length contraction),

which is exactly Eq. 37-13, the length contraction equation. Thus, length contrac-
tion is a special case of the more general Lorentz equations.

Sample Problem 37.05 Lorentz transformations and reversing the sequence of events

An Earth starship has been sent to check an Earth outpost
on the planet P1407, whose moon houses a battle group of
the often hostile Reptulians. As the ship follows a straight-
line course first past the planet and then past the moon, it
detects a high-energy microwave burst at the Reptulian
moon base and then, 1.10 s later, an explosion at the Earth
outpost, which is 4.00 x 10° m from the Reptulian base as
measured from the ship’s reference frame. The Reptulians
have obviously attacked the Earth outpost, and so the star-
ship begins to prepare for a confrontation with them.

(a) The speed of the ship relative to the planet and its moon
is 0.980c. What are the distance and time interval between
the burst and the explosion as measured in the planet-moon
frame (and thus according to the occupants of the stations)?

KEY IDEAS

 

1. This problem involves measurements made from two
reference frames, the planet—moon frame and the star-
ship frame.

2. We have two events: the burst and the explosion.

3. We need to transform the given data as measured in the
starship frame to the corresponding data as measured in
the planet—moon frame.

Starship frame: Before we get to the transformation, we need
to carefully choose our notation. We begin with a sketch of the
situation as shown in Fig. 37-10. There, we have chosen the
ship’s frame S to be stationary and the planet-moon frame S’
to be moving with positive velocity (rightward). (This is an arbi-
trary choice; we could, instead, have chosen the planet-moon
frame to be stationary. Then we would redraw V in Fig. 37-10 as
being attached to the S frame and indicating leftward motion; v
would then be a negative quantity. The results would be the
same.) Let subscripts e and b represent the explosion and burst,
respectively. Then the given data, all in the unprimed (starship)
reference frame, are

AX = x. — Xp = +4.00 x 108m
and At=t,— t= +1.10s.

Here, Ax is a positive quantity because in Fig. 37-10, the co-
ordinate x, for the explosion is greater than the coordinate x,

The relative motion alters the time intervals between
events and maybe even their sequence.

for the burst; At is also a positive quantity because the time f,
of the explosion is greater (later) than the time f, of the burst.

Planet-moon frame: We seek Ax’ and At’, which we shall get
by transforming the given S-frame data to the planet-moon
frame S'. Because we are considering a pair of events, we
choose transformation equations from Table 37-2—namely,
Egs. 1’ and 2’:

 

Ax’ = y(Ax — v At) (37-27)
and At = (ar = st i (37-28)
Here, v = +0.980c and the Lorentz factor is

Equation 37-27 then becomes
Ax' = (5.0252)[4.00 x 108m — (+0.980c)(1.10 s)]
= 3.86 x 108m,
