37-6 MOMENTUM AND ENERGY

K = E — me? = ymce? — me?

= mc?(y— 1) (kinetic energy), (37-52)

where y(= 1/V/1 — (vic)’) is the Lorentz factor for the object’s motion.

Figure 37-13 shows plots of the kinetic energy of an electron as calculated with
the correct definition (Eq. 37-52) and the classical approximation (Eq. 37-51), both
as functions of v/c. Note that on the left side of the graph the two plots coincide; this
is the part of the graph—at lower speeds—where we have calculated kinetic ener-
gies so far in this book. This part of the graph tells us that we have been justified in
calculating kinetic energy with the classical expression of Eq. 37-51. However, on the
right side of the graph—at speeds near c—the two plots differ significantly. As v/c
approaches 1.0, the plot for the classical definition of kinetic energy increases only
moderately while the plot for the correct definition of kinetic energy increases dra-
matically, approaching an infinite value as v/c approaches 1.0. Thus, when an object’s
speed v is near c, we must use Eq. 37-52 to calculate its kinetic energy.

Work. Figure 37-13 also tells us something about the work we must do on an
object to increase its speed by, say, 1 %.The required work Wis equal to the resulting
change AK in the object’s kinetic energy. If the change is to occur on the low-speed,
left side of Fig. 37-13, the required work might be modest. However, if the change is
to occur on the high-speed, right side of Fig. 37-13, the required work could be enor-
mous because the kinetic energy K increases so rapidly there with an increase in
speed v. To increase an object’s speed to c would require, in principle, an infinite
amount of energy; thus, doing so is impossible.

The kinetic energies of electrons, protons, and other particles are often stated
with the unit electron-volt or one of its multiples used as an adjective. For example,
an electron with a kinetic energy of 20 MeV may be described as a 20 MeV electron.

Momentum and Kinetic Energy

In classical mechanics, the momentum p of a particle is mv and its kinetic energy
Kis 3mv?. If we eliminate v between these two expressions, we find a direct rela-
tion between momentum and kinetic energy:

p= 2Km (37-53)
We can find a similar connection in relativity by eliminating v between the

relativistic definition of momentum (Eq. 37-41) and the relativistic definition of
kinetic energy (Eq. 37-52). Doing so leads, after some algebra, to

(classical).

(pe)? = K? + 2Kmc?. (37-54)

With the aid of Eq. 37-47, we can transform Eq. 37-54 into a relation between the
momentum p and the total energy E of a particle:

E? = (pc)? + (me?) (37-55)

The right triangle of Fig. 37-14 can help you keep these useful relations in mind.
You can also show that, in that triangle,
sind=B and cos @= l/y. (37-56)
With Eq. 37-55 we can see that the product pc must have the same unit as
energy E; thus, we can express the unit of momentum p as an energy unit divided
by c, usually as MeV/c or GeV/c in fundamental particle physics.

less than, or equal to those of a 1 GeV proton?

Figure 37-13 The relativistic (Eq. 37-52) and
classical (Eq. 37-51) equations for the
kinetic energy of an electron, plotted as a
function of vic, where v is the speed of the
electron and c is the speed of light. Note
that the two curves blend together at low
speeds and diverge widely at high speeds.
Experimental data (at the X marks) show
that at high speeds the relativistic curve
agrees with experiment but the classical
curve does not.

This might help you to

remember the relations. \
