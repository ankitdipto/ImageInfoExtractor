light-second, as are the clocks along the y axis, and all the clocks
are synchronized via the procedure described in Module 37-1.
When the initial synchronizing signal of t= 0 from the origin
reaches (a) clock A, (b) clock B, and (c) clock C, what initial time is
then set on those clocks? An event occurs at clock A when it reads
10s. (d) How long does the signal of that event take to travel to an
observer stationed at the origin? (e) What time does that observer
assign to the event?

8 Therest energy and total energy, respec-
tively, of three particles, expressed in terms
ofa basic amount A are (1) A,2A; (2) A, 3A;
(3) 3A, 4A. Without written calculation,
rank the particles according to their (a)
mass, (b) kinetic energy, (c) Lorentz factor,
and (d) speed, greatest first.

9 Figure 37-20 shows the triangle of
Fig 37-14 for six particles; the slanted lines 2
and 4 have the same length. Rank the parti-
cles according to (a) mass, (b) momentum
magnitude, and (c) Lorentz factor, greatest
first. (d) Identify which two particles have
the same total energy. (e) Rank the three
lowest-mass particles according to kinetic
energy, greatest first.

away from you. The signals have the same proper frequency fy. The
speed and direction (both relative to you) of the shuttle craft are
(a) 0.3¢ toward, (b) 0.6¢ toward, (c) 0.3c away, and (d) 0.6c away.
Rank the shuttle craft according to the frequency you receive,
greatest first.

11 Figure 37-21 shows one of four star cruisers that are in a race.
As each cruiser passes the starting line, a shuttle craft leaves the
cruiser and races toward the finish line. You, judging the race, are
stationary relative to the starting and finish lines. The speeds v, of
the cruisers relative to you and the speeds v, of the shuttle craft rel-
ative to their respective starships are, in that order, (1) 0.70c, 0.40c;
(2) 0.40¢, 0.70c; (3) 0.20c, 0.90e; (4) 0.50c, 0.60c. (a) Rank the shut-
tle craft according to their speeds relative to you, greatest first.
(b) Rank the shuttle craft according to the distances their pilots
measure from the starting line to the finish line, greatest first.
(c) Each starship sends a signal to its shuttle craft at a certain fre-
quency f, as measured on board the starship. Rank the shuttle craft
according to the frequencies they detect, greatest first.

Module 37-1 Simultaneity and Time Dilation

°1 The mean lifetime of stationary muons is measured to be
2.2000 ys. The mean lifetime of high-speed muons in a burst of
cosmic rays observed from Earth is measured to be 16.000 us. To
five significant figures, what is the speed parameter £ of these cos-
mic-ray muons relative to Earth?

°2 To eight significant figures, what is speed parameter £ if the
Lorentz factor y is (a) 1.010 000 0, (b) 10.000 000, (c) 100.000 00,
and (d) 1000.000 0?

**3 You wish to make a round trip from Earth in a spaceship,
traveling at constant speed in a straight line for exactly 6 months
(as you measure the time interval) and then returning at the same
constant speed. You wish further, on your return, to find Earth as
it will be exactly 1000 years in the future. (a) To eight significant
figures, at what speed parameter £ must you travel? (b) Does it
matter whether you travel in a straight line on your journey?

4 (Come) back to the future. Suppose that a father is 20.00 y older
than his daughter. He wants to travel outward from Earth for 2.000 y
and then back for another 2.000 y (both intervals as he measures
them) such that he is then 20.00 y younger than his daughter. What
constant speed parameter (relative to Earth) is required?

**5 iw An unstable high-energy particle enters a detector and
leaves a track of length 1.05 mm before it decays. Its speed relative
to the detector was 0.992c. What is its proper lifetime? That is, how

long would the particle have lasted before decay had it been at rest
with respect to the detector?

°*7 The premise of the Planet of the Apes movies and book is that
hibernating astronauts travel far into Earth’s future, to a time
when human civilization has been replaced by an ape civilization.
Considering only special relativity, determine how far into Earth’s
future the astronauts would travel if they slept for 120 y while trav-
eling relative to Earth with a speed of 0.9990c, first outward from
Earth and then back again.
