observer S at rest relative to the tube. An observer S’ who is at rest rel-
ative to the electron, however, would see this tube moving with speed
v (= Bc). What length would observer S’ measure for the tube?

*9 SSM A spaceship of rest length 130m races past a timing
station at a speed of 0.740c. (a) What is the length of the spaceship
as measured by the timing station? (b) What time interval will the
station clock record between the passage of the front and back
ends of the ship?

°10 A meter stick in frame S’ makes an angle of 30° with the x’
axis. If that frame moves parallel to the x axis of frame S with
speed 0.90c relative to frame S, what is the length of the stick as
measured from S?

*11 A rod lies parallel to the x axis of reference frame S, moving
along this axis at a speed of 0.630c. Its rest length is 1.70 m. What
will be its measured length in frame S?

°°12 The length of a spaceship is measured to be exactly half its
rest length. (a) To three significant figures, what is the speed
parameter £ of the spaceship relative to the observer’s frame?
(b) By what factor do the spaceship’s clocks run slow relative to
clocks in the observer's frame?

°°13 © A space traveler takes off from Earth and moves at speed
0.9900c toward the star Vega, which is 26.00 ly distant. How much
time will have elapsed by Earth clocks (a) when the traveler
reaches Vega and (b) when Earth observers receive word from the
traveler that she has arrived? (c) How much older will Earth ob-
servers calculate the traveler to be (measured from her frame)
when she reaches Vega than she was when she started the trip?

+14 @ A rod is to move at con- L,
stant speed v along the x axis of
reference frame S, with the rod’s
length parallel to that axis. An ob-
server in frame S is to measure the
length L of the rod. Figure 37-23

eter B for a range of values for B. 0 04 08

°°15 @ The center of our Milky

Way galaxy is about 23 000 ly away. (a) To eight significant figures,
at what constant speed parameter would you need to travel exactly
23 000 ly (measured in the Galaxy frame) in exactly 30 y (mea-
sured in your frame)? (b) Measured in your frame and in light-
years, what length of the Galaxy would pass by you during the trip?

Module 37-3 The Lorentz Transformation

°16 Observer S reports that an event occurred on the x axis of his
reference frame at x = 3.00 x 10° m at time f = 2.50 s. Observer S’
and her frame are moving in the positive direction of the x axis at a
speed of 0.400c Further, x = x' =0 at ¢ = ¢ = 0. What are the
(a) spatial and (b) temporal coordinate of the event according to
S'? If S" were, instead, moving in the negative direction of the
X axis, what would be the (c) spatial and (d) temporal coordinate of
the event according to S'?

 

°17 ssM www In Reg. 37-9, the origins of the two frames
coincide at t = t' = Oand the relative speed is 0.950c. Two microme-
teorites collide at coordinates x = 100 km and t = 200 us according
to an observer in frame S. What are the (a) spatial and (b) temporal
coordinate of the collision according to an observer in frame S'?

°18 Inertial frame S' moves at a speed of 0.60c with respect to
frame S (Fig. 37-9). Further, x = x’ = 0 at t= ¢' = 0. Two events are
recorded. In frame S, event 1 occurs at the origin at ¢ = 0 and event
2 occurs on the x axis at x = 3.0km at t= 4.0 us. According to
observer S', what is the time of (a) event 1 and (b) event 2? (c) Do
the two observers see the same sequence or the reverse?

°19 An experimenter arranges to trigger two flashbulbs
simultaneously, producing a big flash located at the origin of his
reference frame and a small flash at x = 30.0 km. An observer
moving at a speed of 0.250c in the positive direction of x also views
the flashes. (a) What is the time interval between them according
to her? (b) Which flash does she say occurs first?

20 @ As in Fig. 37-9, reference 4,
frame S' passes reference frame S
with a certain velocity. Events 1 and
2 are to have a certain temporal
separation At’ according to the S"
observer. However, their spatial
separation Ax’ according to that
observer has not been set yet. Figure
37-24 gives their temporal separa- 0 200 400
tion At according to the S observer Ax’ (m)

Ax' values. The vertical axis scale is
set by At, = 6.00 us. What is At’?

21 Relativistic reversal of events. Figures 37-25a and b show the
(usual) situation in which a primed reference frame passes an un-
primed reference frame, in the common positive direction of the x
and x’ axes, at a constant relative velocity of magnitude v. We are
at rest in the unprimed frame; Bullwinkle, an astute student of rela-
tivity in spite of his cartoon upbringing, is at rest in the primed
frame. The figures also indicate events A and B that occur at the
following spacetime coordinates as measured in our unprimed
frame and in Bullwinkle’s primed frame:

At (us)

Event Unprimed Primed
A (ata) (Asta)
B (xz, ta) (Xp. te)

In our frame, event A occurs before event B, with temporal separa-
tion At = tg — t4 = 1.00 us and spatial separation Av = xg — x4 =
400 m. Let At’ be the temporal separation of the events according
to Bullwinkle. (a) Find an expression for Ar’ in terms of the speed
parameter (= v/c) and the given data. Graph Ar' versus B for the
following two ranges of B:

(b) 000.01
(c) O.1tol

(vis low, from 0 to 0.01c)
(v is high, from 0.1 to the limit c)

(d) At what value of £ is At’ = 0? For what range of @ is the
