or vice versa? Explain.

+22 For the passing reference frames in Fig. 37-25, events A and
B occur at the following spacetime coordinates: according to the
unprimed frame, (x4, t4) and (xg, tg); according to the primed
frame, (x},, t4) and (xg, tg). In the unprimed frame, At = tg — t4 =
1.00 ws and Ax = xg — x4 = 400 m. (a) Find an expression for Ax’
in terms of the speed parameter f and the given data. Graph Ax’
versus for two ranges of : (b) 0 to 0.01 and (c) 0.1 to 1. (d) At

23 tLw A clock moves along an x axis at a speed of 0.600c and
reads zero as it passes the origin of the axis. (a) Calculate the

24 Bullwinkle in reference frame S’ passes you in reference
frame S along the common direction of the x’ and x axes, as in
Fig. 37-9. He carries three meter sticks: meter stick 1 is parallel to
the x’ axis, meter stick 2 is parallel to the y' axis, and meter stick 3 is
parallel to the z' axis. On his wristwatch he counts off 15.0 s, which
takes 30.0 s according to you. Two events occur during his passage.
According to you, event 1 occurs at x, = 33.0 m and f, = 22.0 ns,
and event 2 occurs at x, =53.0m and ft = 62.0ns. According
to your measurements, what is the length of (a) meter stick 1,
(b) meter stick 2, and (c) meter stick 3? According to Bullwinkle,
what are (d) the spatial separation and (e) the temporal separation
between events 1 and 2, and (f) which event occurs first?

flash occurs at x; = 1200 m and, 5.00 ys later, a small flash occurs
at x) = 480 m. As detected by observer S', the two flashes occur at
a single coordinate x’. (a) What is the speed parameter of S’, and
(b) is S' moving in the positive or negative direction of the x axis?
To S', (c) which flash occurs first and (d) what is the time interval
between the flashes?

*°26 In Fig. 37-9, observer S detects two flashes of light. A big
flash occurs at x; = 1200 m and, slightly later, a small flash occurs
at X) = 480 m. The time interval between the flashes is At = 4 — ty.
What is the smallest value of At for which observer S’ will deter-
mine that the two flashes occur at the same x’ coordinate?

Module 37-4 The Relativity of Velocities

°27 SSM A particle moves along the x’ axis of frame S’ with
velocity 0.40c. Frame S’ moves with velocity 0.60c with respect
to frame S. What is the velocity of the particle with respect to
frame S?

28 In Fig. 37-11,frame S’ moves relative to frame S with velocity
0.62ci while a particle moves parallel to the common x and x" axes.
An observer attached to frame S’ measures the particle’s velocity
to be 0.47ci. In terms of c, what is the particle’s velocity as mea-
sured by an observer attached to frame S according to the (a) rela-
tivistic and (b) classical velocity transformation? Suppose, instead,
that the S’ measure of the particle’s velocity is —0.47ci. What
velocity does the observer in S now measure according to the
(c) relativistic and (d) classical velocity transformation?

°29 Galaxy A is reported to be receding from us with a speed of
0.35c. Galaxy B, located in precisely the opposite direction, is also
found to be receding from us at this same speed. What multiple of c
gives the recessional speed an observer on Galaxy A would find
for (a) our galaxy and (b) Galaxy B?

x' axes of reference frames S and S", at a certain velocity relative
