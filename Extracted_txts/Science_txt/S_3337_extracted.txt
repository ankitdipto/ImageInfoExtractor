1148 CHAPTER 37 RELATIVITY

38 Figure 37-27 is a graph of intensity versus wavelength for
light reaching Earth from galaxy NGC 7319, which is about 3 X 108
light-years away. The most intense light is emitted by the oxygen in
NGC 7319. In a laboratory that emission is at wavelength A = 513
nm, but in the light from NGC 7319 it has been shifted to 525 nm
due to the Doppler effect (all the emissions from NGC 7319 have
been shifted). (a) What is the radial speed of NGC 7319 relative to
Earth? (b) Is the relative motion toward or away from our planet?

“45 Ina high-energy collision between a cosmic-ray particle and
a particle near the top of Earth’s atmosphere, 120 km above sea
level, a pion is created. The pion has a total energy E of 1.35 X 10°
MeV and is traveling vertically downward. In the pion’s rest frame,
the pion decays 35.0 ns after its creation. At what altitude above
sea level, as measured from Earth’s reference frame, does the de-
cay occur? The rest energy of a pion is 139.6 MeV.

tion reduces to m. (c) If a particle has K = 55.0 MeV when p =

of Eq. 37-52 for the kinetic energy of a particle. (a) Retain the first
two terms of the expansion to show the kinetic energy in the form
K = (first term) + (second term).

second term is the first-order correction to the classical expression.

tion? If the electron’s speed is 0.80c, what is the value of (d) the

“53 In Module 28-4, we showed that a particle of charge q and
mass m will move in a circle of radius r = mv/iqiB when its velocity
V is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field B. We also found
that the period T of the motion is independent of speed v. These
two results are approximately correct if v <c. For relativistic
speeds, we must use the correct equation for the radius:
