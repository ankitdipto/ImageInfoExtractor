(c) Suppose that in an explosion of a fission bomb, 0.080% of the
fissionable mass is converted to released energy. What weight of
fissionable material is needed for an explosive release of 1.80 X

°°57 Quasars are thought to be the nuclei of active galaxies in the
early stages of their formation. A typical quasar radiates energy at
the rate of 10 W. At what rate is the mass of this quasar being re-
duced to supply this energy? Express your answer in solar mass
units per year, where one solar mass unit (1 smu = 2.0 X 10* kg) is
the mass of our Sun.

58 The mass of an electron is 9.109 381 88 X 10-™ kg, To eight sig-
nificant figures, find the following for the given electron kinetic en-
ergy: (a) yand (b) B for K = 1.000 000 0 keV, (c) yand (d) B for K =
1.000 000 0 MeV, and then (e) yand (f) 8 for K = 1.0000000 GeV.

59 @ An alpha particle with kinetic energy 7.70 MeV collides
with an “‘N nucleus at rest, and the two transform into an '7O nu-
cleus and a proton. The proton is emitted at 90° to the direction of
the incident alpha particle and has a kinetic energy of 4.44 MeV.The
masses of the various particles are alpha particle, 4.00260.u; “N,
14.00307 u; proton, 1.007825 u; and '7O, 16.99914 u. In MeV, what are
(a) the kinetic energy of the oxygen nucleus and (b) the Q of the
reaction? (Hint: The speeds of the particles are much less than c.)

63 © Superluminal jets. Figure 37-29a shows the path taken by a
knot in a jet of ionized gas that has been expelled from a galaxy.
The knot travels at constant velocity V at angle @ from the direc-
tion of Earth. The knot occasionally emits a burst of light, which
is eventually detected on Earth. Two bursts are indicated in
Fig. 37-29a, separated by time f as measured in a stationary frame
near the bursts. The bursts are shown in Fig. 37-290 as if they were
photographed on the same piece of film, first when light from burst
1 arrived on Earth and then later when light from burst 2 arrived.
The apparent distance D,,, traveled by the knot between the two
bursts is the distance across an Earth-observer’s view of the knot’s
path. The apparent time T,,,, between the bursts is the difference in
the arrival times of the light from them. The apparent speed of the
knot is then V,,, = Dapp/Tpp- In terms of v, f, and 6, what are

served, they seemed to defy special relativity—at least until the
correct geometry (Fig. 37-29a) was understood.
