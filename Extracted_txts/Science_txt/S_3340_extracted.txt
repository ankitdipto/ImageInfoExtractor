with respect to Earth, how far (on the average) will such a pion
move through the atmosphere before it decays?

75 SSM If we intercept an electron having total energy 1533
MeV that came from Vega, which is 26 ly from us, how far in light-
years was the trip in the rest frame of the electron?

76 The total energy of a proton passing through a laboratory ap-
paratus is 10.611 nJ. What is its speed parameter 8? Use the proton
mass given in Appendix B under “Best Value,” not the commonly
remembered rounded number.

77 A spaceship at rest in a certain reference frame S is given a
speed increment of 0.50c. Relative to its new rest frame, it is then
given a further 0.50c increment. This process is continued until its
speed with respect to its original frame S exceeds 0.999c. How
many increments does this process require?

78 Inthe red shift of radiation from a distant galaxy, a certain ra-
diation, known to have a wavelength of 434 nm when observed in
the laboratory, has a wavelength of 462 nm. (a) What is the radial
speed of the galaxy relative to Earth? (b) Is the galaxy approach-
ing or receding from Earth?

kinetic energy of 2.00 MeV?

80 The radius of Earth is 6370 km, and its orbital speed about the
Sun is 30 km/s. Suppose Earth moves past an observer at this
speed. To the observer, by how much does Earth’s diameter con-
tract along the direction of motion?

81 A particle with mass m has speed c/2 relative to inertial frame
S. The particle collides with an identical particle at rest relative to
frame S. Relative to S, what is the speed of a frame S' in which the
total momentum of these particles is zero? This frame is called the
center of momentum frame.

82 An elementary particle produced in a laboratory experiment
travels 0.230 mm through the lab at a relative speed of 0.960c be-
fore it decays (becomes another particle). (a) What is the proper
lifetime of the particle? (b) What is the distance the particle travels
as measured from its rest frame?

ing at speed 0.990c? What are (d) K, (e) E, and (f) p (in MeV/c) for
an electron moving at speed 0.990c?

84 A radar transmitter T is fixed to a reference frame S’ that is
moving to the right with speed v relative to reference frame S
(Fig. 37-33). A mechani-

cal timer (essentially a § s

clock) in frame S', having
a period 7) (measured in
S'), causes transmitter T
to emit timed radar
pulses, which travel at the
speed of light and are
received by R, a receiver
fixed in frame S. (a)
What is the period r of the timer as detected by observer A, who is
fixed in frame S? (b) Show that at receiver R the time interval be-
tween pulses arriving from Tis not ror 7, but

(Hint: A clock and a radar pulse are not the same thing.)

85 One cosmic-ray particle approaches Earth along Earth’s
north-south axis with a speed of 0.80c to-
ward the geographic north pole, and an-
other approaches with a speed of 0.60c
toward the geographic south pole (Fig. 37-
34). What is the relative speed of approach
of one particle with respect to the other?

86 (a) How much energy is released in
the explosion of a fission bomb containing
3.0 kg of fissionable material? Assume that
0.10% of the mass is converted to released
energy. (b) What mass of TNT would have
to explode to provide the same energy re-
lease? Assume that each mole of TNT lib-
erates 3.4 MJ of energy on exploding. The
molecular mass of TNT is 0.227 kg/mol. (c)
For the same mass of explosive, what is the
ratio of the energy released in a nuclear ex-
plosion to that released in a TNT explosion?

ference, what speed would the electron actually attain?

88 A Foron cruiser moving directly toward a Reptulian scout
ship fires a decoy toward the scout ship. Relative to the scout ship,
the speed of the decoy is 0.980c and the speed of the Foron cruiser
is 0.900c. What is the speed of the decoy relative to the cruiser?

89 In Fig. 37-35, three spaceships are in a chase. Relative to an
X axis in an inertial frame (say, Earth frame), their velocities are
va = 0.900c, vg, and ve = 0.800c. (a) What value of vg is required
such that ships A and C approach ship B with the same speed rela-
tive to ship B, and (b) what is that relative speed?

90 Space cruisers A and B are moving parallel to the positive
direction of an x axis. Cruiser A is faster, with a relative speed of
v = 0.900c, and has a proper length of L = 200 m. According to the
pilot of A, at the instant (¢ = 0) the tails of the cruisers are aligned,
the noses are also. According to the pilot of B, how much later are
the noses aligned?

what speed is required of cruiser B such that its pilot sees A and
the station approach B at the same speed?
