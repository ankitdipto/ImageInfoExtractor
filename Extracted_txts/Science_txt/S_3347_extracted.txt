1158 CHAPTER 38 PHOTONS AND MATTER WAVES

Multiplying this result by the elementary charge e, we find
h = (4.1 X 1075 V-s)(1.6 X 107! C) = 6.6 x 10“ J -s,

which agrees with values measured by many other methods.

An aside: An explanation of the photoelectric effect certainly requires quan-
tum physics. For many years, Einstein’s explanation was also a compelling argu-
ment for the existence of photons. However, in 1969 an alternative explanation
for the effect was found that used quantum physics but did not need the concept
of photons. As shown in countless other experiments, light is in fact quantized as
photons, but Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect is not the best ar-

gument for that fact.

V Checkpoint 2

The figure shows data like those of Fig. 38-2 for targets of cesium,
potassium, sodium, and lithium. The plots are parallel. (a) Rank the targets
according to their work functions, greatest first. (b) Rank the plots accord-

ing to the value of h they yield, greatest first.

 

Sample Problem 38.02 Photoelectric effect and work function

Find the work function ® of sodium from Fig. 38-2.

KEY IDEAS

 

‘We can find the work function ® from the cutoff frequency
fo (which we can measure on the plot). The reasoning is this:
At the cutoff frequency, the kinetic energy Kyax in Eq. 38-5
is zero. Thus, all the energy Af that is transferred from a
photon to an electron goes into the electron’s escape, which
requires an energy of ®.

Calculations: From that last idea, Eq. 38-5 then gives us, with
f= fo,

hfy=0+0=9.
In Fig. 38-2, the cutoff frequency fg is the frequency at which

the plotted line intercepts the horizontal frequency axis,
about 5.5 x 1014 Hz. We then have

@ = hfy = (6.63 X 10-¥J-s)(5.5 x 10! Hz)

= 36 x 10-9 J = 23 eV. (Answer)

Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to...

38.08 For a photon, apply the relationships between momen-
tum, energy, frequency, and wavelength.

38.09 With sketches, describe the basics of a Compton scat-
tering experiment.

38.10 Identify the historic importance of Compton scattering.

38.11 Foran increase in the Compton-scattering angle ¢,
identify whether these quantities of the scattered x ray
increase or decrease: kinetic energy, momentum,
wavelength.

38.12 For Compton scattering, describe how the conserva-

tions of momentum and kinetic energy lead to the equation
giving the wavelength shift AA.

38.13 For Compton scattering, apply the relationships
between the wavelengths of the incident and scattered
x rays, the wavelength shift AA, the angle ¢ of photon
scattering, and the electron’s final energy and momentum
(both magnitude and angle).

38.14 In terms of photons, explain the double-slit experiment
in the standard version, the single-photon version, and the
single-photon, wide-angle version.
