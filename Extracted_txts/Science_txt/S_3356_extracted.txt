38-5 ELECTRONS AND MATTER WAVES

Electrons and Matter Waves

In 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie made the following appeal to sym-
metry: A beam of light is a wave, but it transfers energy and momentum to matter
only at points, via photons. Why can’t a beam of particles have the same proper-
ties? That is, why can’t we think of a moving electron—or any other particle—as
a matter wave that transfers energy and momentum to other matter at points?

In particular, de Broglie suggested that Eq. 38-7 (p = h/A) might apply not
only to photons but also to electrons. We used that equation in Module 38-3 to
assign a momentum p to a photon of light with wavelength A. We now use it, in
the form

A= ih (de Broglie wavelength), (38-17)
P

to assign a wavelength A to a particle with momentum of magnitude p. The
wavelength calculated from Eq. 38-17 is called the de Broglie wavelength of the
moving particle. De Broglie’s prediction of the existence of matter waves was
first verified experimentally in 1927, by C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer of the
Bell Telephone Laboratories and by George P. Thomson of the University of
Aberdeen in Scotland.

experiment. In the experiment, an interference pattern was built up when

Figure 38-9 Photographs showing the buildup of an inter-
ference pattern by a beam of electrons in a two-slit in-
terference experiment like that of Fig. 38-6. Matter
waves, like light waves, are probability waves. The ap-
proximate numbers of electrons involved are (a) 7, (b)
100, (c) 3000, (d) 20 000, and (e) 70 000.
