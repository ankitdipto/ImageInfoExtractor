cle nature. Figure 38-11, for example, shows the tracks of particles (rather than
waves) revealed in a bubble chamber. When a charged particle passes through
the liquid hydrogen that fills such a chamber, the particle causes the liquid to va-
porize along the particle’s path. A series of bubbles thus marks the path, which is
usually curved due to a magnetic field set up perpendicular to the plane of the
chamber.

In Fig. 38-11, a gamma ray left no track when it entered at the top because
the ray is electrically neutral and thus caused no vapor bubbles as it passed
through the liquid hydrogen. However, it collided with one of the hydrogen
atoms, kicking an electron out of that atom; the curved path taken by the electron
to the bottom of the photograph has been color coded green. Simultaneous with
the collision, the gamma ray transformed into an electron and a positron in a pair
production event (see Eq. 21-15). Those two particles then moved in tight spirals

Matter waves traveling between detection points such as J and F in Fig. 38-12 will
explore all possible paths, a few of which are shown.

In general, for every path connecting J and F (except the straight-line path),
there will be a neighboring path such that matter waves following the two paths
cancel each other by interference. For the straight-line path joining J and F, mat-
ter waves traversing all neighboring paths reinforce the wave following the direct
path. You can think of the bubbles that form the track as a series of detection
