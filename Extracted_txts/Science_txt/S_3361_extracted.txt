along its path.

Equation 38-24 is the time-independent solution of Schrédinger’s equation.
‘We can assume it is the spatial part of the wave function at some initial time t = 0.
Given values for E and U, we could determine the coefficients A and B to see
how the wave function looks at t = 0. Then, if we wanted to see how the wave
function evolves with time, we follow the guide of Eq. 38-18 and multiply
Eq. 38-24 by the time dependence e~™:

W(x, 1) = W (ae = (Ae + Bemik*) em iet
= Aeitkx-wt) 4 Bem i(ke+at), (38-25)

Here, however, we will not go that far.

Finding the Probability Density | x?

In Module 16-1 we saw that any function F of the form F(kx + wf) represents a
traveling wave. In Chapter 16, the functions were sinusoidal (sines and cosines);
here they are exponentials. If we wanted, we could always switch between the
two forms by using the Euler formula: For a general argument 6,

e=cos@+isin@ and e%’=cos@— isin @ (38-26)

The first term on the right in Eq. 38-25 represents a wave traveling in the posi-
tive direction of x, and the second term represents a wave traveling in the negative
direction of x. Let’s evaluate the probability density |y71 for a particle with only posi-
tive motion. We eliminate the negative motion by setting B to zero, and then the
solution at t = 0 becomes

p(x) = Ae™. (38-27)

To calculate the probability density, we take the square of the absolute value:
IpP = Ae? = Ale?
Because
lel? = (elk) (eikt)* = eiktgmike = gik—ikee = 9 = 1

we get
IP? = A2(1)P? = A.

Now here is the point: For the condition we have set up (uniform potential en-
ergy U, including U = 0 for a free particle), the probability density is a constant
(the same value A”) for any point along the x axis, as shown in the plot of Fig.
38-13. That means that if we make a measurement to locate the particle, the loca-
tion could turn out to be at any x value. Thus, we cannot say that the particle is
moving along the axis in a classical way as a car moves along a street. Jn fact, the
particle does not have a location until we measure it.
