uncertainty Ax in location along that axis. Since we want
the minimum allowed uncertainty, we use the equality
instead of the inequality in the x-axis part of Eq. 38-28,
writing Av- Ap, = h.

Calculations: To evaluate the uncertainty Ap, in the momen-
tum, we must first evaluate the momentum component p,.
Because the electron’s speed v, is much less than the speed of
light c, we can evaluate p, with the classical expression for mo-
mentum instead of using a relativistic expression. We find

Px = mv, = (9.11 X 101 kg)(2.05 x 108 m/s)
= 187 X 10 kg-m/s.

The uncertainty in the speed is given as 0.50% of the
measured speed. Because p, depends directly on speed,

the uncertainty Ap, in the momentum must be 0.50% of the
momentum:

Ap, = (0.0050)p,
= (0.0050)(1.87 x 10-* kg- m/s)

38-8 REFLECTION FROM A POTENTIAL STEP

Learning Objectives
After reading this module, you should be able to...

38.32 Write the general wave function for Schrédinger's
equation for an electron in a region of constant (including
zero) potential energy.

38.33 With a sketch, identify a potential step for an electron,
indicating the barrier height U,.

38.34 For electron wave functions in two adjacent regions,
determine the coefficients (probability amplitudes) by
matching values and slopes at the boundary.

38.35 Determine the reflection and transmission coefficients
for electrons incident on a potential step (or potential

Key Ideas

@ A particle can reflect from a boundary at which its
potential energy changes even when classically it would not
reflect.

@ The reflection coefficient R gives the probability of reflec-
tion of an individual particle at the boundary.

energy step), where the incident electrons each have zero
potential energy U = 0 anda mechanical energy E greater
than the step height U,.

38.36 Identify that because electrons are matter waves, they
might reflect from a potential step even when they have
more than enough energy to pass through the step.

38.37 Interpret the reflection and transmission coefficients in
terms of the probability of an electron reflecting or passing
through the boundary and also in terms of the average num-
ber of electrons out of the total number shot at the barrier.

@ For a beam of a great many particles, R gives the average
fraction that will undergo reflection.

@ The transmission coefficient T that gives the probability of
transmission through the boundary is

T=1-R.

Reflection from a Potential Step

Here is a quick taste of what you would see in more advanced quantum physics.
In Fig. 38-14, we send a beam of a great many nonrelativistic electrons, each of to-
tal energy E, along an x axis through a narrow tube. Initially they are in region 1

x=0 where their potential energy is U = 0, but at x = 0 they encounter a region witha

negative electric potential V,. The transition is called a potential step or potential
energy step. The step is said to have a height U;, which is the potential energy an
electron will have once it passes through the boundary at x = 0, as plotted in
