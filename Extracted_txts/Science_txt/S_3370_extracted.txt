Module 38-1 The Photon, the Quantum of Light

*1 Monochromatic light (that is, light of a single wavelength) is to
be absorbed by a sheet of photographic film and thus recorded on
the film. Photon absorption will occur if the photon energy equals
or exceeds 0.6 eV, the smallest amount of energy needed to dissoci-
ate an AgBr molecule in the film. (a) What is the greatest
wavelength of light that can be recorded by the film? (b) In what
region of the electromagnetic spectrum is this wavelength located?

°2 How fast must an electron move to have a kinetic energy
equal to the photon energy of sodium light at wavelength 590 nm?

*3 At what rate does the Sun emit photons? For simplicity,
assume that the Sun’s entire emission at the rate of 3.9 x 10° Wis
at the single wavelength of 550 nm.

4 A helium—neon laser emits red light at wavelength A = 633 nm in
a beam of diameter 3.5 mm and at an energy-emission rate of 5.0 mW.
A detector in the beam’s path totally absorbs the beam. At what rate
per unit area does the detector absorb photons?

*5 The meter was once defined as 1650 763.73 wavelengths of
the orange light emitted by a source containing krypton-86 atoms.
What is the photon energy of that light?

*6 What is the photon energy for yellow light from a highway
sodium lamp at a wavelength of 589 nm?

“7 A light detector (your eye) has an area of 2.00 X 10-® m? and
absorbs 80% of the incident light, which is at wavelength 500 nm.
The detector faces an isotropic source, 3.00 m from the source. If
the detector absorbs photons at the rate of exactly 4.000 s~!, at
what power does the emitter emit light?

“8 The beam emerging from a 1.5 W argon laser (A = 515 nm)
has a diameter d of 3.0 mm. The beam is focused by a lens system
with an effective focal length f;, of 2.5mm. The focused beam
strikes a totally absorbing screen, where it forms a circular
diffraction pattern whose central disk has a radius R given by
1.22f,Ad. It can be shown that 84% of the incident energy ends up
within this central disk. At what rate are photons absorbed by the
screen in the central disk of the diffraction pattern?

9 © A 100 Wsodium lamp (A = 589 nm) radiates energy uni-
formly in all directions. (a) At what rate are photons emitted by the
lamp? (b) At what distance from the lamp will a totally absorbing
screen absorb photons at the rate of 1.00 photon/cm?-s? (c) What
is the photon flux (photons per unit area per unit time) on a small
screen 2.00 m from the lamp?

10 A satellite in Earth orbit maintains a panel of solar cells
of area 2.60 m? perpendicular to the direction of the Sun’s light
rays. The intensity of the light at the panel is 1.39 kW/m’. (a) At
what rate does solar energy arrive at the panel? (b) At what rate
