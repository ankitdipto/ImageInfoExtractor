39-2 WAVE FUNCTIONS OF A TRAPPED ELECTRON

level of the electron and a higher level, according to Eq. 39-6
(hf = AE). Otherwise, a photon cannot be absorbed.
Wavelength: Substituting c/A for f, we can rewrite Eq. 39-6 as
he

A= AE: (39-9)
For the energy difference AE, we found in (b), this equation
gives us

(d) Once the electron has been excited to the second excited
state, what wavelengths of light can it emit by de-excitation?

KEY IDEAS

1. The electron tends to de-excite, rather than remain in an
excited state, until it reaches the ground state (n = 1).

2. If the electron is to de-excite, it must lose just enough
energy to jump to a lower energy level.

3. If it is to lose energy by emitting light, then the loss of
energy must be by emission of a photon.

Downward jumps: Starting in the second excited state (at

the n = 3 level), the electron can reach the ground state (n = 1)

by either making a quantum jump directly to the ground-state

energy level (Fig. 39-5a) or by making two separate jumps by

way of the n = 2 level (Figs. 39-5b and c).

The direct jump involves the same energy difference
AE;, we found in (c). Then the wavelength is the same as we
calculated in (c)—except now the wavelength is for light
that is emitted, not absorbed. Thus, the electron can jump di-
rectly to the ground state by emitting light of wavelength

A= 412 x 10° m. (Answer)

Following the procedure of part (b), you can show that

the energy differences for the jumps of Figs. 39-5b and c are

AE = 3.016 X 10-7 and AEs, = 1.809 x 10-"J.
From Eq. 39-9, we then find that the wavelength of the light
emitted in the first of these jumps (from n = 3 to n = 2) is

A= 6.60 X 10-° m, (Answer)

and the wavelength of the light emitted in the second of
these jumps (from n = 2 ton = 1) is

A= 1.10 x 10-* m. (Answer)
