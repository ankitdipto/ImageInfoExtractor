Figure 39-6 The probability density y2(x) for
four states of an electron trapped ina
one-dimensional infinite well; their quan-
tum numbers are n = 1,2,3,and 15. The
electron is most likely to be found where
w(x) is greatest and least likely to be found
where #/2(x) is least.

Wave Functions of a Trapped Electron

If we solve Schrédinger’s equation for an electron trapped in a one-dimensional infi-
nite potential well of width L and impose the boundary condition that the solutions be
zero at the infinite walls, we find that the wave functions for the electron are given by

U(x) = A so( 2 :) forn =1,2,3,..., (39-10)

for 0 = x = L (the wave function is zero outside that range). We shall soon evaluate
the amplitude constant A in this equation.

Note that the wave functions y,,(x) have the same form as the displacement
functions y,,(x) for a standing wave on a string stretched between rigid supports
(see Eq. 39-2). We can picture an electron trapped in a one-dimensional well
between infinite-potential walls as being a standing matter wave.

Probability of Detection

The wave function y,(x) cannot be detected or directly measured in any way —
we cannot simply look inside the well to see the wave the way we can see, say,
a wave in a bathtub of water. All we can do is insert a probe of some kind to try to
detect the electron. At the instant of detection, the electron would materialize at
the point of detection, at some position along the x axis within the well.

If we repeated this detection procedure at many positions throughout the
well, we would find that the probability of detecting the electron is related to the
probe’s position x in the well. In fact, they are related by the probability density

2(x). Recall from Module 38-6 that in general the probability that a particle can
be detected in a specified infinitesimal volume centered on a specified point is
proportional to |,2l. Here, with the electron trapped in a one-dimensional well,
we are concerned only with detection of the electron along the x axis. Thus, the
probability density ¥3(x) here is a probability per unit length along the x axis.
(We can omit the absolute value sign here because y;,(x) in Eq. 39-10 is a real
quantity, not a complex one.) The probability p(x) that an electron can be
detected at position x within the well is

probability p(x) 7 .
of detection in width dx} = (Probab density wt) (width dx),
centered on position x at position x
or P(x) = W(x) dx. (39-11)

From Eq. 39-10, we see that the probability density (x) is
W(x) = 2 sve( 2 :) for n = 1,2,3,..., (39-12)

for the range 0=x =L (the probability density is zero outside that range).
Figure 39-6 shows W(x) for n = 1, 2,3, and 15 for an electron in an infinite well
whose width L is 100 pm.

To find the probability that the electron can be detected in any finite section
of the well—say, between point x, and point x.—we must integrate p(x) between
those points. Thus, from Eqs. 39-11 and 39-12,
