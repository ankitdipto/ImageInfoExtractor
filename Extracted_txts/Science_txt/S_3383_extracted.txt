CHAPTER 39 MORE ABOUT MATTER WAVES

We can make the zero-point energy as small as we like by making the infinite
well wider —that is, by increasing L in Eq. 39-4 for n = 1. In the limit as L > ~,
the zero-point energy E, — 0. However, the electron is then a free particle, no
longer confined in the x direction. Also, because the energy of a free particle is
not quantized, that energy can have any value, including zero. Only a confined
particle must have a finite zero-point energy and can never be at rest.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

Each of the following particles is confined to an infinite well, and all four wells have the
same width: (a) an electron, (b) a proton, (c) a deuteron, and (d) an alpha particle. Rank
their zero-point energies, greatest first. The particles are listed in order of increasing mass.

Sample Problem 39.02 Detection probability in a 1D infinite potential well

A ground-state electron is trapped in the one-dimensional
infinite potential well of Fig. 39-2, with width L = 100 pm.

(a) What is the probability that the electron can be detected
in the left one-third of the well (x; = 0 tox, = L/3)?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) If we probe the left one-third of the well, there is no guaran-
tee that we will detect the electron. However, we can calculate
the probability of detecting it with the integral of Eq. 39-13.
(2) The probability very much depends on which state the elec-
tron is in—thatis, the value of quantum number n.

Calculations: Because here the electron is in the ground
state, we set n = 1 in Eq.39-13. We also set the limits of inte-
gration as the positions x, = 0 and x, = L/3 and set the
amplitude constant A as V/2/L (so that the wave function is
normalized). We then see that

probability of detection) _ (7 2. sin? ay ae
in left one-third a) L ~

We could find this probability by substituting 100 x 10? m
for L and then using a graphing calculator or a computer
math package to evaluate the integral. Here, however, we
shall evaluate the integral “by hand.” First we switch to a
new integration variable y:

y=a* and dx = dy.

From the first of these equations, we find the new limits of
integration to be y, = 0 for x; = Oand y) = 77/3 for x) = L/3.
‘We then must evaluate

Using integral 11 in Appendix E, we then find

probability = — (S i 0) = 0.20.
wT 0

Thus, we have

(Probability of detection

in left one-third ) aol Ce)

That is, if we repeatedly probe the left one-third of the well, then
on average we can detect the electron with 20% of the probes.

(b) What is the probability that the electron can be detected
in the middle one-third of the well?

Reasoning: We now know that the probability of detection
in the left one-third of the well is 0.20. By symmetry, the
probability of detection in the right one-third of the well is
also 0.20. Because the electron is certainly in the well, the
probability of detection in the entire well is 1. Thus, the prob-
ability of detection in the middle one-third of the well is

Sample Problem 39.03 Normalizing wave functions in a 1D infinite potential well

Evaluate the amplitude constant A in Eq. 39-10 for an infinite
potential well extending from x = Otox = L.

KEY IDEA

The wave functions of Eq. 39-10 must satisfy the normalization
requirement of Eq. 39-14, which states that the probability that
the electron can be detected somewhere along the x axis is 1.

Calculations: Substituting Eq. 39-10 into Eq. 39-14 and tak-
ing the constant A outside the integral yield

‘We have changed the limits of the integral from —% and +
to Oand L because the “outside” wave function is zero.
