CHAPTER 39 MORE ABOUT MATTER WAVES

called the well depth. The analogy between waves on a stretched string and mat-
ter waves fails us for wells of finite depth because we can no longer be sure that
matter wave nodes exist at x = 0 and atx = L.(As we shall see, they don’t.)

To find the wave functions describing the quantum states of an electron in
the finite well of Fig. 39-7, we must resort to Schrédinger’s equation, the basic
equation of quantum physics. From Module 38-6 recall that, for motion in one
dimension, we use Schrédinger’s equation in the form of Eq. 38-19:

2
ay + 8x°m
dx? r
Rather than attempting to solve this equation for the finite well, we simply state the
results for particular numerical values of Up and L. Figure 39-8 shows three results as
graphs of (x), the probability density, for a well with Up = 450 eV and L = 100 pm.

The probability density ¥2(x) for each graph in Fig. 39-8 satisfies Eq. 39-14,
the normalization equation; so we know that the areas under all three probability
density plots are numerically equal to 1.

If you compare Fig. 39-8 for a finite well with Fig. 39-6 for an infinite well, you
will see one striking difference: For a finite well, the electron matter wave
penetrates the walls of the well—into a region in which Newtonian mechanics
says the electron cannot exist. This penetration should not be surprising because
we saw in Module 38-9 that an electron can tunnel through a potential energy
barrier. “Leaking” into the walls of a finite potential energy well is a similar
phenomenon. From the plots of in Fig. 39-8, we see that the leakage is greater
for greater values of quantum number n.

Because a matter wave does leak into the walls of a finite well, the wavelength A
for any given quantum state is greater when the electron is trapped in a finite well
than when it is trapped in an infinite well of the same length L. Equation 39-3 (A =
h/\/2mE) then tells us that the energy E for an electron in any given state is less
in the finite well than in the infinite well.

That fact allows us to approximate the energy-level diagram for an elec-
tron trapped in a finite well. As an example, we can approximate the diagram
for the finite well of Fig. 39-8, which has width L = 100 pm and depth Uy = 450
eV. The energy-level diagram for an infinite well of that width is shown in Fig. 39-
3. First we remove the portion of Fig. 39-3 above 450 eV. Then we shift the re-
maining four energy levels down, shifting the level forn = 4 the most because the
wave leakage into the walls is greatest for n = 4. The result is approximately the
energy-level diagram for the finite well. The actual diagram is Fig. 39-9.

In that figure, an electron with an energy greater than Up (= 450 eV) has
too much energy to be trapped in the finite well. Thus, it is not confined, and its
energy is not quantized; that is, its energy is not restricted to certain values. To
reach this nonquantized portion of the energy-level diagram and thus to be free,
a trapped electron must somehow obtain enough energy to have a mechanical
energy of 450 eV or greater.

Sample Problem 39.04 Electron escaping from a finite potential well

Suppose a finite well with Uj = 450eV and L = 100 pm
confines a single electron in its ground state.

(a) What wavelength of light is needed to barely free it with
a single photon absorption?

KEY IDEA

 

For the electron to escape, it must receive enough energy to
jump to the nonquantized energy region of Fig. 39-9 and
end up with an energy of at least Uy (= 450 eV).

Barely escaping: The electron is initially in its ground
state, with an energy of E,; = 27 eV. So, to barely become
free, it must receive an energy of

Uy — E, = 450 eV — 27 eV = 423 eV.

Thus the photon must have this much energy. From Eq.
