Thus, if A = 2.94 nm, the electron just barely escapes.

(b) Can the ground-state electron absorb light with A =
2.00 nm? If so, what then is the electron’s energy?

KEY IDEAS

A=

1. In (a) we found that light of 2.94 nm will just barely free
the electron from the potential well.

2. We are now considering light with a shorter wavelength of
2.00 nm and thus a greater energy per photon (hf = hc/A).

3. Hence, the electron can absorb a photon of this light. The

energy transfer will not only free the electron but will also
provide it with more kinetic energy. Further, because the
electron is then no longer trapped, its energy is not
quantized.
More than escaping: The energy transferred to the elec-
tron is the photon energy:

From (a), the energy required to just barely free the electron
from the potential well is Uy — E; (= 423 eV). The remainder
of the 622 eV goes to kinetic energy. Thus, the kinetic energy
of the freed electron is
K = hf — (Uy ~ F)
= 622 eV — 423 eV = 199eV. (Answer)
