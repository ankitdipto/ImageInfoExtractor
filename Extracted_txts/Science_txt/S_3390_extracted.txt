Sample Problem 39.05 Energy levels in a 2D infinite potential well

An electron is trapped in a square corral that is a two-
dimensional infinite potential well (Fig. 39-13) with widths
EL

(a) Find the energies of the lowest five possible energy levels
for this trapped electron, and construct the corresponding
energy-level diagram.

KEY IDEA

 

Because the electron is trapped in a two-dimensional well
that is rectangular, the electron’s energy depends on two
quantum numbers, n, and n,, according to Eq. 39-20.

Energy levels: Because the well here is square, we can let the
widths be L, = Ly = L. Then Eq. 39-20 simplifies to

nz + n2). (39-22)

The lowest energy states correspond to low values of the
quantum numbers n, and n,, which are the positive integers
1, 2,..., %. Substituting those integers for n, and n, in
Eg. 39-22, starting with the lowest value 1, we can obtain the
energy values as listed in Table 39-1. There we can see that
several of the pairs of quantum numbers (n,, n,) give the same

energy. For example, the (1,2) and (2, 1) states both have an
energy of 5(H?/8mL7). Each such pair is associated with degen-
erate energy levels. Note also that, perhaps surprisingly, the
(4,1) and (1,4) states have less energy than the (3,3) state.
From Table 39-1 (carefully keeping track of degenerate
levels), we can construct the energy-level diagram of Fig. 39-15.

(b) As a multiple of h7/8mL7, what is the energy difference
between the ground state and the third excited state?

Energy difference: From Fig. 39-15, we see that the ground
state is the (1, 1) state, with an energy of 2(h7/8mL7). We also
see that the third excited state (the third state up from the
ground state in the energy-level diagram) is the degenerate
(1, 3) and (3, 1) states, with an energy of 10(H7/8mL7). Thus,
the difference AE between these two states is
