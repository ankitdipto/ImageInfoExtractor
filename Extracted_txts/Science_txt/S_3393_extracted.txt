We can rewrite this as

These last three equations tell us that, in the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the
electron’s orbital radius r is quantized and the smallest possible orbital radius (for
n= 1) is a, which is called the Bohr radius. According to the Bohr model, the
electron cannot get any closer to the nucleus than orbital radius a, and that is why
the attraction between electron and nucleus does not simply collapse them together.

Orbital Energy Is Quantized

Let’s next find the energy of the hydrogen atom according to the Bohr model. The
electron has kinetic energy K = ;mv?, and the electron—nucleus system has elec-
tric potential energy U = qqx/47reqr (Eq. 24-46). Again, let q; be the electron’s
charge —e and q, be the nuclear charge +e. Then the mechanical energy is

Next, replacing r with its equivalent from Eq. 39-26, we have

where the subscript n on E signals that we have now quantized the energy.

From this equation, Bohr was able to calculate the visible wavelengths emitted
and absorbed by hydrogen, but before we discuss how to go from the energy equa-
tion to the wavelengths, let’s discuss the correct model of the hydrogen atom.

Hydrogen is a
three-dimensional,
finite electron trap,
with walls that vary
in depth with
distance.

between the electron and the central proton. The plot is shown twice (on the left and on
the right) to suggest the three-dimensional spherically symmetric trap in which the
electron is confined.
