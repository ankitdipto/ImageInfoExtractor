39-5 THE HYDROGEN ATOM 1205

Schrodinger’s Equation and the Hydrogen Atom

In Schrédinger’s model of the hydrogen atom, the electron (charge —e) is in a po-
tential energy trap due to its electrical attraction to the proton (charge +e) at the
center of the atom. From Eq. 24-46, we write the potential energy function as

 

Ur) = (39-32)

Because this well is three-dimensional, it is more complex than our previous one-
and two-dimensional wells. Because this well is finite, it is more complex than the
three-dimensional well of Fig. 39-14. Moreover, it does not have sharply defined
walls. Rather, its walls vary in depth with radial distance r. Rgure 39-17 is proba-
bly the best we can do in drawing the hydrogen potential well, but even that
drawing takes much effort to interpret.

To find the allowed energies and wave functions for an electron trapped in
the potential well given by Eq. 39-32, we need to apply Schrédinger’s equation.
With some manipulation, we would find that we could separate the equation into
three separate differential equations, two depending on angles and one depending
on radial distance r. The solution of the latter equation requires a quantum num-
ber n and produces the energy values E,, of the electron:

me* 1
E, = Beye for n = 1,2,3,
(This equation is exactly what Bohr found by using a very wrong planetary model
of the atom.) Evaluating the constants in Eq. 39-33 gives us

This equation tells us that the energy E,, of the hydrogen atom is quantized; that is,
E,, is restricted by its dependence on the quantum number n. Because the nucleus is
assumed to be fixed in place and only the electron has motion, we can assign the en-
ergy values of Eq. 39-34 either to the atom as a whole or to the electron alone.

Energy Changes

The energy of a hydrogen atom (or, equivalently, of its electron) changes when
the atom emits or absorbs light. As we have seen several times since Eq. 39-6,
emission and absorption involve a quantum of light according to

hf = AE = Ein ~ iow (39-35)

Let’s make three changes to Eq. 39-35. On the left side, we substitute c/A
for f. On the right side, we use Eq. 39-33 twice to replace the energy terms Then,
with a simple rearrangement, we have
