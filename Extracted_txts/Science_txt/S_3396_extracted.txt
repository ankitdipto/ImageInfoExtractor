Figure 39-18 (a) An energy-level diagram for the hydrogen atom. Some of the transitions for (b) the Lyman series, (c) the Balmer
series, and (d) the Paschen series. For each, the longest four wavelengths and the series-limit wavelength are plotted on a
wavelength axis. Any wavelength shorter than the series-limit wavelength is allowed.
