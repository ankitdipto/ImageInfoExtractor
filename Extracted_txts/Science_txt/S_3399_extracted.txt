Figure 39-21 A dot plot showing the

volume probability density y°(r) for the
hydrogen atom in the quantum state with
n = 2,€ = 0,andm, = 0.The plot has
spherical symmetry about the central
nucleus. The gap in the dot density pattern
marks a spherical surface over which

Wr) = 0.

 

Figure 39-22 The relationship between the
coordinates x, y, and z of the rectangular
coordinate system and the coordinates r, 6,
and ¢ of the spherical coordinate system.
The latter are more appropriate for analyz-
ing situations involving spherical symmetry,
such as the hydrogen atom.

bility density y(r, @) for the hydrogen
atom in states with n = 2 and € = 1. (a)

bility density is symmetric about the z axis.

The energy of the ground state, found by putting n =1 in Eq. 39-34, is
E, = —13.60 eV.The wave function of Eq. 39-39 results if you solve Schrédinger’s
equation with this value of the energy. Actually, you can find a solution
of Schrédinger’s equation for any value of the energy—say, E = —11.6 eV or
—14.3 eV. This may suggest that the energies of the hydrogen atom states are not
quantized—but we know that they are.

The puzzle was solved when physicists realized that such solutions of
Schrédinger’s equation are not physically acceptable because they yield increas-
ingly large values as r — ~. These “wave functions” tell us that the electron is
more likely to be found very far from the nucleus rather than closer to it, which
makes no sense. We discard such solutions and accept only solutions that meet
the boundary condition y(r) — 0 as r > ©; that is, we agree to deal only with
confined electrons. With this restriction, the solutions of Schrédinger’s equation
form a discrete set, with quantized energies given by Eq. 39-34.

Hydrogen Atom States with n=2

According to the requirements of Table 39-2, there are four states of the hydro-
gen atom with n = 2; their quantum numbers are listed in Table 39-3. Consider
first the state with n = 2 and € = m, = 0; its probability density is represented by
the dot plot of Fig. 39-21. Note that this plot, like the plot for the ground state
shown in Fig. 39-20, is spherically symmetric. That is, in a spherical coordinate
system like that defined in Fig. 39-22, the probability density is a function of the
radial coordinate r only and is independent of the angular coordinates @ and ¢.

It turns out that all quantum states with € = 0 have spherically symmetric
wave functions. This is reasonable because the quantum number ¢ is a measure
of the angular momentum associated with a given state. If € = 0, the angular
momentum is also zero, which requires that the probability density representing
the state have no preferred axis of symmetry.

Dot plots of y for the three states with n= 2 and ¢ = 1 are shown in
Fig. 39-23. The probability densities for the states with m, = +1 and m, = —1are
