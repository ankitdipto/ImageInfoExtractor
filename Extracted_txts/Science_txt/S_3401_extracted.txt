tion that is true if r = a, so that the term (a — r) in the
middle of the equation is zero. In other words, dP/dr is
equal to zero when r=a. (Note that we also have

dP/dr = 0 at r= 0 and at r= ~~. However, these condi-
tions correspond to a minimum in P(r), as you can see in
Fig. 39-19.)

Sample Problem 39.07 Probability of detection of the electron in a hydrogen atom

It can be shown that the probability p(r) that the electron in
the ground state of the hydrogen atom will be detected
inside a sphere of radius r is given by

P(r) =1- e (1 + 2x + 2x7),

in which x, a dimensionless quantity, is equal to r/a. Find r
for p(r) = 0.90.

KEY IDEA

 

There is no guarantee of detecting the electron at any par-
ticular radial distance r from the center of the hydrogen
atom. However, with the given function, we can calculate
the probability that the electron will be detected somewhere
within a sphere of radius r.

Calculation: We seek the radius of a sphere for which
P(r) = 0.90. Substituting that value in the expression for p(r),
we have

0.90 = 1 — e*(1 + 2x + 2x2)

or 10e-7(1 + 2x + 2x”) =1.

‘We must find the value of x that satisfies this equality. It is not
possible to solve explicitly for x, but an equation solver on
a calculator yields x = 2.66. This means that the radius of a
sphere within which the electron will be detected 90% of
the time is 2.66a. Mark this position on the horizontal axis of
Fig. 39-19. The area under the curve from r = 0 tor = 2.66a
gives the probability of detection in that range and is 90% of the
total area under the curve.

Sample Problem 39.08 Light emission from a hydrogen atom

(a) What is the wavelength of light for the least energetic
photon emitted in the Lyman series of the hydrogen atom
spectrum lines?

KEY IDEAS

(1) For any series, the transition that produces the least
energetic photon is the transition between the home-base
level that defines the series and the level immediately above
it. (2) For the Lyman series, the home-base level is at n = 1
(Fig. 39-18b). Thus, the transition that produces the least ener-
getic photon is the transition from the n = 2 level tothen = 1
level.

Calculations: From Eq. 39-34 the energy difference is

1 1
AE = E, — E, = —(13.60 eV) (+ Se =) = 10.20 eV.

Then from Eq. 39-6 (AE = hf), with c/A replacing f, we have

~ AE (10.20 eV)(1.60 x 10- J/eV)

= 1.22 x 10-7 m = 122 nm. (Answer)

Light with this wavelength is in the ultraviolet range.

(b) What is the wavelength of the series limit for the Lyman
series?

KEY IDEA

 

The series limit corresponds to a jump between the home-
base level (n = 1 for the Lyman series) and the level at the
limit n = ~.

Calculations: Now that we have identified the values of n
for the transition, we could proceed as in (a) to find the cor-
responding wavelength A. Instead, let’s use a more direct
procedure. From Eq. 39-37, we find

a Niow Thigh

= 1.097 373 x 107 m~

 

 

which yields
A=9.11 X 107° m = 91.1 nm. (Answer)

Light with this wavelength is also in the ultraviolet range.
