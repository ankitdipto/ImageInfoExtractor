tains an electron in its third excited state. We position an electron-
detector probe of width 2.00 pm so that it is centered on a point of
maximum probability density. (a) What is the probability of detec-
tion by the probe? (b) If we insert the probe as described 1000

that you can take the probability density to be constant within it.)

Module 39-3 An Electron in a Finite Well

°17 An electron in the n = 2 state in the finite potential well of
Fig, 39-7 absorbs 400 eV of energy from an external source. Using
the energy-level diagram of Fig. 39-9, determine the electron’s ki-
netic energy after this absorption, assuming that the electron
moves to a position for which x > L.

a finite potential energy well 450 eV deep. If the electron is in the
n = 3state, what is its kinetic energy?

nite, one-dimensional energy well that contains an electron. The
nonquantized region begins at E, = 450.0 eV. Figure 39-28b gives
the absorption spectrum of the electron when it is in the ground
state—it can absorb at the indicated wavelengths: A, = 14.588 nm
and A, = 4.8437 nm and for any wavelength less than A. = 2.9108
nm. What is the energy of the first excited state?
