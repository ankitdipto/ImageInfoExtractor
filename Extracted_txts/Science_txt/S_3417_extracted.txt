CHAPTER 40 ALL ABOUT ATOMS

of many electrons, each with a spin magnetic moment and an orbital magnetic
moment. We also know that all those moments vectorially cancel out except for a
single electron, and the orbital dipole moment of that electron is zero. Thus, the
combined dipole moment ## of a silver atom is the spin magnetic dipole moment
of that single electron. According to Eq. 40-13, this means that 4, can have only
two components along the z axis in Fig. 40-8. One component is for quantum
number m, = +4 (the single electron is spin up), and the other component is for
quantum number m, = —} (the single electron is spin down). Substituting into
Eq. 40-13 gives us

tise =~ 249) = Hy and py = Dau = +H (40-18)

Then substituting these expressions for j2, in Eq. 40-17, we find that the force compo-

nent F, deflecting the silver atoms as they pass through the magnetic field can have
only the two values

which result in the two spots of silver on the glass. Although no one knew about

spin at the time, the Stern—Gerlach results were actually the first experimental

evidence of electron spin.

Sample Problem 40.01 Beam separation in a Stern—Gerlach experiment

In the Stern—Gerlach experiment of Fig. 40-8, a beam of
silver atoms passes through a magnetic field gradient
dBidz of magnitude 1.4 T/mm that is set up along the z
axis. This region has a length w of 3.5 cm in the direction of
the original beam. The speed of the atoms is 750 m/s. By
what distance d have the atoms been deflected when they
leave the region of the field gradient? The mass M of a sil-
ver atom is 1.8 X 10-* kg.

KEY IDEAS

(1) The deflection of a silver atom in the beam is due to an
interaction between the magnetic dipole of the atom and
the magnetic field, because of the gradient dB/dz. The
deflecting force is directed along the field gradient (along
the z axis) and is given by Eqs. 40-19. Let us consider only
deflection in the positive direction of z; thus, we shall use
F, = 3(dB/dz) from Egs. 40-19.

(2) We assume the field gradient dB/dz has the same value
throughout the region through which the silver atoms travel.
Thus, force component F, is constant in that region, and from
Newton’s second law, the acceleration a, of an atom along the
zaxis due to F, is also constant.

Calculations: Putting these ideas together, we write the
acceleration as

M M

Because this acceleration is constant, we can use Eq. 2-15
(from Table 2-1) to write the deflection d parallel to the
Zaxis as

a = Fe = bslaBldz)

d= vot +4a,2 = 0t +4 (Bo) )e, (40-20)

Because the deflecting force on the atom acts perpendi-
cular to the atom’s original direction of travel, the compo-
nent v of the atom’s velocity along the original direction of
travel is not changed by the force. Thus, the atom requires
time ¢ = w/v to travel through length w in that direction.
Substituting w/v for t into Eq. 40-20, we find

The separation between the two subbeams is twice this, or
0.16 mm. This separation is not large but is easily measured.
