Sample Problem 40.02 Energy levels of multiple electrons in a 2D infinite potential well

Seven electrons are confined to a square corral (two-
dimensional infinite potential well) with widths L, = L, = L
(Fig. 39-13). Assume that the electrons do not electrically
interact with one another.

(a) What is the electron configuration for the ground state
of the system of seven electrons?

One-electron diagram: We can determine the electron con-
figuration of the system by placing the seven electrons in the
corral one by one, to build up the system. Because we assume
the electrons do not electrically interact with one another, we
can use the energy-level diagram for a single trapped electron

into the second level. (e) The system’s

in order to keep track of how we place the seven electrons in
the corral. That one-electron energy-level diagram is given in
Fig. 39-15 and partially reproduced here as Fig. 40-12a. Recall
that the levels are labeled as E.,,,,, for their associated energy.
For example, the lowest level is for energy E,,, where quan-
tum number 7, is 1 and quantum number ny is 1.

Pauli principle: The trapped electrons must obey the Pauli
exclusion principle; that is, no two electrons can have the
same set of values for their quantum numbers n,, n,, and
my. The first electron goes into energy level E;, and can
