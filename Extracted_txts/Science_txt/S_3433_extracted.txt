CHAPTER 40 ALL ABOUT ATOMS

atoms to state E;, which is metastable with a mean life of at least 1 us. (The neon
atoms are too massive to be excited by collisions with the (low-mass) electrons.)

The energy of helium state E; (20.61 eV) is very close to the energy of neon
state E, (20.66 eV). Thus, when a metastable (£3) helium atom and a ground-
state (Ep) neon atom collide, the excitation energy of the helium atom is often
transferred to the neon atom, which then moves to state £). In this manner, neon
level E, (with a mean life of 170 ns) can become more heavily populated than
neon level E, (which, with a mean life of only 10 ns, is almost empty).

This population inversion is relatively easy to set up because (1) initially there
are essentially no neon atoms in state Ej, (2) the long mean life of helium level E;
means that there is always a good chance that collisions will excite neon atoms to
their E, level, and (3) once those neon atoms undergo stimulated emission and fall to
their E, level, they almost immediately fall down to their ground state (via
intermediate levels not shown) and are then ready to be re-excited by collisions.

Suppose now that a single photon is spontaneously emitted as a neon atom
transfers from state E> to state E;. Such a photon can trigger a stimulated emis-
sion event, which, in turn, can trigger other stimulated emission events. Through
such a chain reaction, a coherent beam of laser light, moving parallel to the tube
axis, can build up rapidly. This light, of wavelength 632.8 nm (red), moves through
the discharge tube many times by successive reflections from mirrors M, and My
shown in Fig. 40-20, accumulating additional stimulated emission photons with
each passage. M, is totally reflecting, but Mp is slightly “leaky” so that a small
fraction of the laser light escapes to form a useful external beam.

Iv] Checkpoint 3

The wavelength of light from laser A (a helium—neon gas laser) is 632.8 nm; that from
laser B (a carbon dioxide gas laser) is 10.6 wm; that from laser C (a gallium arsenide
semiconductor laser) is 840 nm. Rank these lasers according to the energy interval be-
tween the two quantum states responsible for laser action, greatest first.

Sample Problem 40.04 Population inversion in a laser

In the helium—neon laser of Fig. 40-20, laser action occurs
between two excited states of the neon atom. However, in
many lasers, laser action (/asing) occurs between the ground
state and an excited state, as suggested in Fig. 40-19).

(a) Consider such a laser that emits at wavelength A = 550
nm. If a population inversion is not generated, what is the
ratio of the population of atoms in state E, to the population
in the ground state Eo, with the atoms at room temperature?

KEY IDEAS

 

(1) The naturally occurring population ratio N,/Np of the two
states is due to thermal agitation of the gas atoms (Eq. 40-29):

NINo = e-(Ex- EORT, (40-30)

To find N,/No with Eq. 40-30, we need to find the energy
separation E, — Ep between the two states. (2) We can ob-
tain E, — Ep from the given wavelength of 550 nm for the
lasing between those two states.

Calculation: The lasing wavelength gives us

_ (6.63 x 10“ J-s)(3.00 x 108 m/s)
~ (550 X 10~° m)(1.60 x 107! J/eV)
= 2.26 eV.
To solve Eq. 40-30, we also need the mean energy of thermal

agitation kT for an atom at room temperature (assumed to
be 300 K), which is

kT = (8.62 X 10-5 eV/K)(300 K) = 0.0259 eV,

in which k is Boltzmann’s constant.
Substituting the last two results into Eq. 40-30 gives us
the population ratio at room temperature:

N,INo = e7 22629100259 eV)
= 13x 10-8. (Answer)

This is an extremely small number. It is not unreasonable,
however. Atoms with a mean thermal agitation energy of
