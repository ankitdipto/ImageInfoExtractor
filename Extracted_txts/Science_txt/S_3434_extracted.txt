only 0.0259 eV will not often impart an energy of 2.26 eV to
another atom in a collision.

(b) For the conditions of (a), at what temperature would
the ratio N,/Np be 1/2?

Calculation: Now we want the temperature T such that
thermal agitation has bumped enough neon atoms up to the
higher-energy state to give N,/No = 1/2. Substituting that ra-
tio into Eq. 40-30, taking the natural logarithm of both sides,
and solving for T yield

Review & Summary

Some Properties of Atoms Atoms have quantized ener-
gies and can make quantum jumps between them. If a jump be-
tween a higher energy and a lower energy involves the emission
or absorption of a photon, the frequency associated with the
light is given by

hf = Exisn ~ Etov- (40-1)

States with the same value of quantum number n form a shell. States
with the same values of quantum numbers n and form a subshell.

Orbital Angular Momentum and Magnetic Dipole
Moments The magnitude of the orbital angular momentum of
an electron trapped in an atom has quantized values given by

L=Vee+ Ih,

where hi is h/27, € is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and n is
the electron’s principal quantum number. The component L, of the
orbital angular momentum on a z axis is quantized and given by

This is much hotter than the surface of the Sun. Thus, it is
clear that if we are to invert the populations of these two
levels, some specific mechanism for bringing this about is
needed —that is, we must “pump” the atoms. No tempera-
ture, however high, will naturally generate a population
inversion by thermal agitation.

Stern-Gerlach Experiment The Stern—Gerlach experi-
ment demonstrated that the magnetic moment of silver atoms is
quantized, experimental proof that magnetic moments at the
atomic level are quantized. An atom with magnetic dipole mo-
ment experiences a force in a nonuniform magnetic field. If the
field changes at the rate of dB/dz along a z axis, then the force is
along the z axis and is related to the component yz, of the dipole

A proton has an intrinsic spin angular momentum S and an intrin-
sic magnetic dipole moment 7 that are in the same direction.

Magnetic Resonance The magnetic dipole moment of a
proton in a magnetic field B along a z axis has two quantized
components on that axis: spin up (j#; is in the direction B) and
spin down (y, is in the opposite direction). Contrary to the situa-
tion with an electron, spin up is the lower energy orientation; the
difference between the two orientations is 24,B. The energy re-
quired of a photon to spin-flip the proton between the two orien-
tations is

hf = 2w-B. (40-22)

The field is the vector sum of an external field set up by equipment
and an internal field set up by the atoms and nuclei surrounding
the proton. Detection of spin-flips can lead to nuclear magnetic
resonance spectra by which specific substances can be identified.
