Module 40-5 Building the Periodic Table

°27 ssM Www Two of the three electrons in a lithium atom
have quantum numbers (n, €, m,,m,) of (1, 0, 0,+3) and (1,0, 0,—3).
What quantum numbers are possible for the third electron if the
atom is (a) in the ground state and (b) in the first excited state?

 

°28 Show that the number of states with the same quantum num-
bern is 2n’.

+29 ® A recently named element is darmstadtium (Ds), which
has 110 electrons. Assume that you can put the 110 electrons into
the atomic shells one by one and can neglect any electron—
electron interaction. With the atom in ground state, what is the
spectroscopic notation for the quantum number ¢ for the last
electron?

°30 For a helium atom in its ground state, what are quantum
numbers (n, €, my, and m,) for the (a) spin-up electron and (b) spin-
down electron?

*31 Consider the elements selenium (Z = 34), bromine (Z = 35),
and krypton (Z = 36). In their part of the periodic table, the sub-

shells of the electronic states are filled in the sequence

1s 2s 2p 35 3p 3d 4s 4p...

What are (a) the highest occupied subshell for selenium and (b) the
number of electrons in it, (c) the highest occupied subshell for
bromine and (d) the number of electrons in it, and (e) the highest
occupied subshell for krypton and (f) the number of electrons in it?

*32 Suppose two electrons in an atom have quantum numbers
n=2 and € = 1. (a) How many states are possible for those two
electrons? (Keep in mind that the electrons are indistinguishable.)
(b) If the Pauli exclusion principle did not apply to the electrons,
how many states would be possible?

Module 40-6 X Rays and the Ordering of the Elements

°33 Through what minimum potential difference must an elec-
tron in an x-ray tube be accelerated so that it can produce x rays
with a wavelength of 0.100 nm?

34 The wavelength of the K, line from iron is 193 pm. What is
the energy difference between the two states of the iron atom that
give rise to this transition?

35 ssM www In Fig. 40-13, the x rays shown are produced
when 35.0 keV electrons strike a molybdenum (Z = 42) target. If
the accelerating potential is maintained at this value but a silver
(Z =47) target is used instead, what values of (a) Ain, (b)
the wavelength of the K, line, and (c) the wavelength of the
K, line result? The K, L, and M atomic x-ray levels for silver
(compare Fig. 40-15) are 25.51,3.56, and 0.53 keV.

*°36 When electrons bombard a molybdenum target, they produce
both continuous and characteristic x rays as shown in Fig. 40-13. In
that figure the kinetic energy of the incident electrons is 35.0 keV. If
the accelerating potential is increased to 50.0 keV, (a) what is the
value of Amin, and (b) do the wavelengths of the K, and K, lines in-
crease, decrease, or remain the same?

  

37 Show that a moving electron cannot spontaneously change
into an x-ray photon in free space. A third body (atom or nucleus)
must be present. Why is it needed? (Hint: Examine the conserva-
tion of energy and momentum.)

38 Hereare the K, wavelengths of a few elements:

Element A(pm) Element A(pm)
Ti 215 Co 179
Vv 250 Ni 166
cr 229 cu 154
Mn 210 Zn 143
Fe 193 Ga 134

Make a Moseley plot (like that in Fig. 40-16) from these data and ver-
ify that its slope agrees with the value given for Cin Module 40-6.

39 SSM Calculate the ratio of the wavelength of the K, line for
niobium (Nb) to that for gallium (Ga). Take needed data from the
periodic table of Appendix G.

*°40 (a) From Eq. 40-26, what is the ratio of the photon energies
due to K, transitions in two atoms whose atomic numbers are Z
and Z'? (b) What is this ratio for uranium and aluminum? (c) For
uranium and lithium?
