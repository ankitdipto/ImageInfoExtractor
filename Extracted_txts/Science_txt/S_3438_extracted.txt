“41 The binding energies of K-shell and L-shell electrons in cop-
per are 8.979 and 0.951 keV, respectively. If a K, xray from copper
is incident on a sodium chloride crystal and gives a first-order
Bragg reflection at an angle of 74.1° measured relative to parallel
planes of sodium atoms, what is the spacing between these parallel
planes?

ated through an electric potential difference of 50.0 kV. Let Ko
be the kinetic energy of an electron at the end of the accelera-
tion. The electron collides with a target nucleus (assume the nu-
cleus remains stationary) and then has kinetic energy K; =
0.500K,. (a) What wavelength is associated with the photon that
is emitted? The electron collides with another target nucleus (as-
sume it, too, remains stationary) and then has kinetic energy

*46 Determine the constant C in Eq. 40-27 to five significant
figures by finding C in terms of the fundamental constants in Eq.
40-24 and then using data from Appendix B to evaluate those
constants. Using this value of C in Eq. 40-27, determine the theo-
retical energy Ejheory of the K,, photon for the low-mass elements
listed in the following table. The table includes the value (eV) of
the measured energy E,,, of the K, photon for each listed ele-

(There is actually more than one K, ray because of the splitting of
the L energy level, but that effect is negligible for the elements
listed here.)
