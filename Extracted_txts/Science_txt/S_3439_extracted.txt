mum energy that could be released by the atoms in a single laser
pulse if each atom jumps once between those two states (either via
absorption or via stimulated emission)?

58 The mirrors in the laser of Fig. 40-20, which are separated by
8.0 cm, form an optical cavity in which standing waves of laser light
can be set up. Each standing wave has an integral number n of half
wavelengths in the 8.0 cm length, where n is large and the waves
differ slightly in wavelength. Near A = 533 nm, how far apart in
wavelength are the standing waves?

+59 @ Figure 40-24 shows the energy levels of two types of
atoms. Atoms A are in one tube, and atoms B are in another tube.
The energies (relative to a ground-state energy of zero) are
indicated; the average lifetime of atoms in each level is also indi-
cated. All the atoms are initially pumped to levels higher than the
levels shown in the figure. The atoms then drop down through the
levels, and many become “stuck” on certain levels, leading to popu-
lation inversion and lasing. The light emitted by A illuminates B
and can cause stimulated emission of B. What is the energy per
photon of that stimulated emission of B?

60 The beam from an argon laser (of wavelength 515 nm) has a di-
ameter d of 3.00 mm and a continuous energy output rate of 5.00 W.
The beam is focused onto a diffuse surface by a lens whose focal length
fis 3.50 cm. A diffraction pattern such as that of Fig. 36-10 is formed,
the radius of the central disk being given by

(see Eq, 36-12 and Fig. 36-14). The central disk can be shown to con-
tain 84% of the incident power. (a) What is the radius of the central
disk? (b) What is the average intensity (power per unit area) in the
incident beam? (c) What is the average intensity in the central disk?

°°61 The active medium in a particular laser that generates laser
light at a wavelength of 694 nm is 6.00 cm long and 1.00 cm in di-
ameter. (a) Treat the medium as an optical resonance cavity analo-
gous to a closed organ pipe. How many standing-wave nodes are
there along the laser axis? (b) By what amount Af would the beam
frequency have to shift to increase this number by one? (c) Show
that Af is just the inverse of the travel time of laser light for one
round trip back and forth along the laser axis. (d) What is the cor-
responding fractional frequency shift Af/f? The appropriate index
of refraction of the lasing medium (a ruby crystal) is 1.75.

62 @ Ruby lases at a wavelength of 694 nm. A certain ruby
crystal has 4.00 X 10" Cr ions (which are the atoms that lase). The
lasing transition is between the first excited state and the ground
state, and the output is a light pulse lasting 2.00 ys. As the pulse be-
gins, 60.0% of the Cr ions are in the first excited state and the rest

are in the ground state. What is the average power emitted during
the pulse? (Hint: Don’t just ignore the ground-state ions.)

66 Comet stimulated emission. When a comet approaches the
Sun, the increased warmth evaporates water from the ice on the
surface of the comet nucleus, producing a thin atmosphere of water
vapor around the nucleus. Sunlight can then dissociate H,O mole-
cules in the vapor to H atoms and OH molecules. The sunlight can
also excite the OH molecules to higher energy levels.

When the comet is still relatively far from the Sun, the sun-
light causes equal excitation to the E; and E; levels (Fig. 40-282).
Hence, there is no population inversion between the two levels.
However, as the comet approaches the Sun, the excitation to the E;
level decreases and population inversion occurs. The reason has to
do with one of the many wavelengths—said to be Fraunhofer
lines—that are missing in sunlight because, as the light travels out-
ward through the Sun’s atmosphere, those particular wavelengths
are absorbed by the atmosphere.

As a comet approaches the Sun, the Doppler effect due to the
comet’s speed relative to the Sun shifts the Fraunhofer lines in
