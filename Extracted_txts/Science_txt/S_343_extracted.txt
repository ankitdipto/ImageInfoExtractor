Expression of Homeotic Genes

After pattern formation has successfully established the
number of body segments in Drosophila, a series of
homeotic genes act as master switches to determine the
forms these segments will assume. Homeotic genes code
for proteins that function as transcription factors. Each
homeotic gene activates a particular module of the genetic
program, initiating the production of specific body parts
within each of the 14 compartments.

Homeotic Mutations

Mutations in homeotic genes lead to the appearance of per-
fectly normal body parts in unusual places. Mutations in
bithorax (figure 17.16), for example, cause a fly to grow an
extra pair of wings, as if it had a double thoracic segment,
and mutations in Antennapedia cause legs to grow out of the
head in place of antennae! In the early 1950s, geneticist
Edward Lewis discovered that several homeotic genes, in-
cluding bithorax, map together on the third chromosome of
Drosophila, in a tight cluster called the bithorax complex.

Mutations in homeotic genes. Three separate mutations in the bithorax gene caused this fruit fly to develop an extra thoracic segment,
with accompanying wings. Compare this photograph with that of the normal fruit fly in figure 17.6.
