wavelength, apparently overlapping one of them with the wave-
length required for excitation to the E, level in OH molecules.
Population inversion then occurs in those molecules, and they radi-
ate stimulated emission (Fig. 40-28b). For example, as comet
Kouhoutek approached the Sun in December 1973 and January
1974, it radiated stimulated emission at about 1666 MHz during
mid-January. (a) What was the energy difference E, — E; for that
emission? (b) In what region of the electromagnetic spectrum was
the emission?

67 Show that the cutoff wavelength (in picometers) in the continu-
ous x-ray spectrum from any target is given by Amin = 1240/V, where
V is the potential difference (in kilovolts) through which the elec-
tronsare accelerated before they strike the target.

68 By measuring the go-and-return time for a laser pulse to
travel from an Earth-bound observatory to a reflector on the
Moon, it is possible to measure the separation between these bod-
ies. (a) What is the predicted value of this time? (b) The separation
can be measured to a precision of about 15 cm. To what uncer-
tainty in travel time does this correspond? (c) If the laser beam
forms a spot on the Moon 3 km in diameter, what is the angular di-
vergence of the beam?

69 ssM Can an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile be
destroyed by an intense laser beam? A beam of intensity
10° Wim? would probably burn into and destroy a nonspinning
missile in 1s. (a) If the laser had 5.0 MW power, 3.0 zm wave-
length, and a 4.0 m beam diameter (a very powerful laser indeed),
would it destroy a missile at a distance of 3000 km? (b) If the
wavelength could be changed, what maximum value would work?
Use the equation for the central diffraction maximum as given by
Eq. 36-12 (sin @ = 1.22A/d).

70 A molybdenum (Z = 42) target is bombarded with 35.0 keV
electrons and the x-ray spectrum of Fig. 40-13 results. The K, and
K,, wavelengths are 63.0 and 71.0 pm, respectively. What photon
energy corresponds to the (a) K, and (b) K, radiation? The two
radiations are to be filtered through one of the substances in the
following table such that the substance absorbs the K, line more
strongly than the K,, line. A substance will absorb radiation x, more
strongly than it absorbs radiation x) if a photon of x; has enough en-

ergy to eject a K electron from an atom of the substance but a photon
of x, does not. The table gives the ionization energy of the K electron
in molybdenum and four other substances. Which substance in the
table will serve (c) best and (d) second best as the filter?

71 An electron in a multielectron atom is known to have the
quantum number € = 3. What are its possible n, m,, and m, quan-
tum numbers?

72 Show that if the 63 electrons in an atom of europium were as-
signed to shells according to the “logical” sequence of quantum
numbers, this element would be chemically similar to sodium.
73 SSM Lasers can be used to generate pulses of light whose du-
rations are as short as 10 fs. (a) How many wavelengths of light

74 Show that f = 1.06 X 10-“J-s = 6.59 X 10“ eV's.

75 Suppose that the electron had no spin and that the Pauli ex-
clusion principle still held. Which, if any, of the present noble gases
would remain in that category?

 

 

76 (A correspondence principle problem.) Estimate (a) the
quantum number ¢ for the orbital motion of Earth around the Sun
and (b) the number of allowed orientations of the plane of Earth’s
orbit. (c) Find @nin, the half-angle of the smallest cone that can be
swept out by a perpendicular to Earth’s orbit as Earth revolves
around the Sun.

77 Knowing that the minimum x-ray wavelength produced by
40.0 keV electrons striking a target is 31.1 pm, determine the
Planck constant h.

78 Consider an atom with two closely spaced excited states A
and B. If the atom jumps to ground state from A or from B,it emits
a wavelength of 500 nm or 510 nm, respectively. What is the energy
difference between states A and B?

79 In 1911,Ernest Rutherford modeled an atom as being a point
of positive charge Ze surrounded by a negative charge — Ze uni-
formly distributed in a sphere of radius R centered at the point. At
distance r within the sphere, the electric potential is

Ze ( 1 3 r )
V= —-— +75}.

(a) From this formula, determine the magnitude of electric field for
0 =r = R. Whatare the (b) electric field and (c) potential for r = R?
