1256 CHAPTER 41 CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY IN SOLIDS

clusion principle —the conduction electrons are stacked up in the partially filled
band of Fig. 41-5 with energies that range from zero to the Fermi energy.

How Many Conduction Electrons Are There?

If we could bring individual atoms together to form a sample of a metal, we would
find that the conduction electrons in the metal are the valence electrons of the atoms
(the electrons in the outermost occupied shells of the atoms). A monovalent atom
contributes one such electron to the conduction electrons in a metal; a bivalent atom
contributes two such electrons. Thus, the total number of conduction electrons is

(number of oanes) _ (rimber of atoms) (camber of vatene) (41-2)
electrons in sample in sample electrons per atom/”

(In this chapter, we shall write several equations largely in words because the
symbols we have previously used for the quantities in them now represent other
quantities.) The number density n of conduction electrons in a sample is the num-
ber of conduction electrons per unit volume:

number of conduction electrons in sample
sample volume V .

(41-3)
We can relate the number of atoms in a sample to various other properties of
the sample and to the material making up the sample with the following:

number of atoms\ _ sample mass Mam _
in sample

sample mass Myon

atomic mass (molar mass M)/Ny

material's density)(sample volume V
_ {material's density)(sample volume V)
- (molar mass M)/Na ’

where the molar mass M is the mass of one mole of the material in the sample
and Nq is Avogadro’s number (6.02 x 107 mol~').

Sample Problem 41.02 Number of conduction electrons in a metal

How many conduction electrons are in a cube of magnesium
of volume 2.00 X 10~° m3? Magnesium atoms are bivalent.

KEY IDEAS

 

1. Because magnesium atoms are bivalent, each magne-
sium atom contributes two conduction electrons.

2. The cube’s number of conduction electrons is related to
its number of magnesium atoms by Eq. 41-2.

3. We can find the number of atoms with Eq. 41-4 and known
data about the cube’s volume and magnesium’s properties.

Calculations: We can write Eq. 41-4 as

ot atoms | = (density) (sample votume VN
in sample molar mass M °

Magnesium has density 1.738 g/em3 (= 1.738 x 10? kg/m*)

fia

and molar mass 24.312 g/mol (= 24.312 x 10~*kg/mol)
(see Appendix F). The numerator gives us

(1.738 X 103 kg/m3)(2.00 x 10~* m3)
X (6.02 x 107? atoms/mol) = 2.0926 x 10?! kg/mol.
2.0926 x 107 kg/mol
24.312 X 10-3 kg/mol
= 8.61 x 10”.
Using this result and the fact that magnesium atoms are
bivalent, we find that Eq. 41-2 yields

Thus, (ee of a
