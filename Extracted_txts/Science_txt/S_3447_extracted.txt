KEY IDEA Calculation: From Eq. 41-5 and Fig, 41-6, we know that the
density of states is a function of energy E. However, for an
energy range AF that is small relative to E, we can approxi-
mate the density of states (and thus the number of states
per electron-volt) to be constant. Thus, at an energy of 7 eV,

 

‘We can obtain the number of states per electron-volt at a
given energy by using the density of states N(£) at that en-
ergy and the sample’s volume V.

Calculations: At an energy of 7 eV, we write we find the number of states N in the energy range AE of
0.003 eV as

From Fig. 41-6, we see that at an energy E of 7 eV, the den-

sity of states is about 1.8 x 10 m=? eV—!. Thus, oe N = (3.6 x 10! eV~)(0,003 eV)

The Occupancy Probability P(E)

If an energy level is available at energy E, what is the probability P(E) that it is
actually occupied by an electron? At T=0K, we know that all levels with
energies below the Fermi energy are certainly occupied (P(E) = 1) and all higher
levels are certainly not occupied (P(E) = 0). Figure 41-7a illustrates this situa-
tion. To find P(E) at temperatures above absolute zero, we must use a set of
quantum counting rules called Fermi-Dirac statistics, named for the physicists
who introduced them. With these rules, the occupancy probability P(E) is
P(E) = VET a7 (occupancy probability), (41-6)
in which EF; is the Fermi energy. Note that P(E) depends not on the energy E of
the level but only on the difference E — Ey, which may be positive or negative.
To see whether Eq. 41-6 describes Fig. 41-7a, we substitute T = 0 K in it. Then,
For E < Ey, the exponential term in Eg. 41-6 is e~*, or zero; so P(E) = 1, in
agreement with Fig. 41-7a.
