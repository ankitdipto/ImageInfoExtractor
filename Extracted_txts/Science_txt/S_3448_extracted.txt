41-1 THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS

Figure 41-7b is a plot of P(E) for T = 1000 K. Compared with Fig. 41-7a, it
shows that, as stated above, changes in the distribution of electrons among the
available states involve only states whose energies are near the Fermi energy Ep.
Note that if E = E; (no matter what the temperature 7), the exponential term in
Eq. 41-6 is e° = 1 and P(E) = 0.5. This leads us to a more useful definition of the
Fermi energy:

Oo The Fermi energy of a given material is the energy of a quantum state that has

1259

the probability 0.5 of being occupied by an electron.

Figures 41-7a and b are plotted for copper, which has a Fermi energy of
7.0 eV. Thus, for copper both at T= 0K and at T= 1000 K, a state at energy

E =7.0 eV hasa probability of 0.5 of being occupied.

Sample Problem 41.04 Probability of occupancy of an energy state in a metal

(a) What is the probability that a quantum state whose
energy is 0.10 eV above the Fermi energy will be occupied?
Assume a sample temperature of 800 K.

KEY IDEA

 

The occupancy probability of any state in a metal can be
found from FermiDirac statistics according to Eq. 41-6.

(b) What is the probability of occupancy for a state that is
0.10 eV below the Fermi energy?

Calculation: The Key Idea of part (a) applies here also
except that now the state has an energy below the Fermi
energy. Thus, the exponent in Eq. 41-6 has the same magni-
tude we found in part (a) but is negative, and that makes the
denominator smaller. Equation 41-6 now yields

Calculations: Let’s start with the exponent in Eq. 41-6: P(E) =— 2 = 0.81 or 81%. (Answer)
E> Ey | 0.10 eV as ew +1
kT (8.62 X 10 eV/K)(800 K) ~ For states below the Fermi energy, we are often more in-
Inserting this exponent into Eq. 41-6 yields terested in the probability that the state is not occupied.
1 This probability is just i =i) ,@r 19%. Note that it is the
P(E) = GEST = 0.19 or 19%. (Answer) same as the probability of occupancy in (a).

How Many Occupied States Are There?

Equation 41-5 and Fig. 41-6 tell us how the available states are distributed in
energy. The occupancy probability of Eq. 41-6 gives us the probability that any
given state will actually be occupied by an electron. To find N,(£), the density of
occupied states, we must multiply each available state by the corresponding value
of the occupancy probability; that is,

density of occupied states | __ / density of states \ {occupancy probability
N,(E) at energy E ~ \N(E) at energy E, P(E) at energy E

or N(E) = N(E) P(E) (density of occupied states). (41-7)

For copper at T = 0 K, Eq. 41-7 tells us to multiply, at each energy, the value
of the density of states function (Eq. 41-6) by the value of the occupancy proba-
