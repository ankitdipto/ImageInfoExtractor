Figure 41-8 (a) The density of occupied states N,(E) for copper at absolute zero. The area under the curve is the number density of electrons n.
Note that all states with energies up to the Fermi energy Ey = 7 eV are occupied, and all those with energies above the Fermi energy are vacant.
(b) The same for copper at T = 1000 K. Note that only electrons with energies near the Fermi energy have been affected and redistributed.

 

Sample Problem 41.05 Number of occupied states in an energy range in a metal

A lump of copper (Fermi energy = 7.0 eV) has volume NA(E) = N(E) P(E) = (1.8 X 10% m= eV~1)(0.50)
2 x 10-° m3. How many occupied states per eV lie in a nar- Pree
row energy range around 7.0 eV? eee eee

Next, we write
KEY IDEAS

 

( number of occupied ) _ eee of occupied )

(1) First we want the density of occupied states N,(E) as states per eV at TeV. states N,(E) at 7 eV

given by Eq. 41-7 (N,(E) = N(E) P(E)). (2) Because we

want to evaluate quantities for a narrow energy range (volume i)

around 7.0 eV (the Fermi energy for copper), the occupancy of sample

probability P(E) is 0.50. Substituting for N,(E£) and V gives us

Calculations: From Fig. 41-6, we see that the density of _ {number of occupied | = (0.9 x 10m eV~!)(2 x 10- m’)
states at 7eV is about 1.8 x 10% meV"! Thus, Eq. 41-7 states per eV =18 Xx 10%ev-!

tells us that the density of occupied states is at7 eV ~2X10%6V-1 (Gens)
