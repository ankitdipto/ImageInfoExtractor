CHAPTER 42 NUCLEAR PHYSICS

Some Nuclear Properties

Table 42-1 shows some properties of a few atomic nuclei. When we are interested
primarily in their properties as specific nuclear species (rather than as parts of
atoms), we call these particles nuclides.

Some Nuclear Terminology

Nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons. The number of protons in a nucleus
(called the atomic number or proton number of the nucleus) is represented by
the symbol Z; the number of neutrons (the neutron number) is represented by
the symbol N. The total number of neutrons and protons in a nucleus is called its
mass number A; thus

A=Z+N. (42-1)

Neutrons and protons, when considered collectively as members of a nucleus, are
called nucleons.

We represent nuclides with symbols such as those displayed in the first col-
umn of Table 42-1. Consider !’Au, for example. The superscript 197 is the mass
number A. The chemical symbol Au tells us that this element is gold, whose atomic
number is 79. Sometimes the atomic number is explicitly shown as a subscript, as in
19 Au. From Eg. 42-1, the neutron number of this nuclide is the difference between
the mass number and the atomic number, namely, 197 — 79, or 118.

Nuclides with the same atomic number Z but different neutron numbers N
are called isotopes of one another. The element gold has 36 isotopes, ranging
from Au to “Au. Only one of them (!*7Au) is stable; the remaining 35 are
radioactive. Such radionuclides undergo decay (or disintegration) by emitting a
particle and thereby transforming to a different nuclide.

Organizing the Nuclides

The neutral atoms of all isotopes of an element (all with the same Z) have the
same number of electrons and the same chemical properties, and they fit into
the same box in the periodic table of the elements. The nuclear properties of the
isotopes of a given element, however, are very different from one isotope to
another. Thus, the periodic table is of limited use to the nuclear physicist, the
nuclear chemist, or the nuclear engineer.

“For stable nuclides, the isotopic abundance is given; this is the fraction of atoms of this type found
in a typical sample of the element. For radioactive nuclides, the half-life is given.

’Following standard practice, the reported mass is that of the neutral atom, not that of the bare nucleus.
