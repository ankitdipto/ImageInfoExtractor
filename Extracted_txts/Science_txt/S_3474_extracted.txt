Sample Problem 42.02 Binding energy per nucleon

What is the binding energy per nucleon for '°Sn?

KEY IDEAS

 

1. We can find the binding energy per nucleon AF,,., if we
first find the binding energy AE, and then divide by
the number of nucleons A in the nucleus, according to
Eq. 42-8 (AE jen = AEp./A)-

2. We can find AE,,. by finding the difference between the
mass energy Mc? of the nucleus and the total mass en-
ergy >(mc?) of the individual nucleons that make up the
nucleus, according to Eq. 42-7 (AE,. = =(mc?) — Mc?).

Calculations: From Table 42-1, we see that a °Sn nucleus

consists of 50 protons (Z = 50) and 70 neutrons (N =

A— Z = 120 — 50 = 70). Thus, we need to imagine a °Sn

nucleus being separated into its 50 protons and 70 neutrons,

(Sn nucleus) > so(serarate) + 7o( separate)
protons neutrons

(42-9)
and then compute the resulting change in mass energy.

For that computation, we need the masses of a !°Sn nu-
cleus, a proton, and a neutron. However, because the mass
of a neutral atom (nucleus p/us electrons) is much easier to
measure than the mass of a bare nucleus, calculations of
binding energies are traditionally done with atomic masses.
Thus, let’s modify Eq. 42-9 so that it has a neutral !°Sn atom
on the left side. To do that, we include 50 electrons on the
left side (to match the 50 protons in the 7°Sn nucleus). We

Sample Problem 42.03 Density of nuclear matter

We can think of all nuclides as made up of a neutron—
proton mixture that we can call nuclear matter. What is the
density of nuclear matter?

KEY IDEA

 

We can find the (average) density p of a nucleus by dividing
its total mass by its volume.

Calculations: Let m represent the mass of a nucleon (either a
proton or a neutron, because those particles have about the
same mass). Then the mass of a nucleus containing A nucleons is
Am.Next, we assume the nucleus is spherical with radius r.Then
its volume is dar, and we can write the density of the nucleus as

must also add 50 electrons on the right side to balance
Eg. 42-9. Those 50 electrons can be combined with the 50
protons, to form 50 neutral hydrogen atoms. We then have

From the mass column of Table 42-1, the mass Mg, of a ?°Sn
atom is 119.902 197 u and the mass my of a hydrogen atom
is 1.007 825 u; the mass m, of a neutron is 1.008 665 u. Thus,
Eq. 42-7 yields
AE,, = X(mc?) — Mc?
= S0(myc?) + 70(m,c?) — Msac?
= 50(1.007 825 u)c? + 70(1.008 665 u)c*
— (119.902 197 u)c*
= (1.095 603 u)c?
= (1.095 603 u)(931.494 013 MeV/u)
= 1020.5 MeV,
where Eq. 42-5 (c? = 931.494 013 MeV/u) provides an easy
unit conversion. Note that using atomic masses instead of
nuclear masses does not affect the result because the mass
of the 50 electrons in the '°Sn atom subtracts out from the
mass of the electrons in the 50 hydrogen atoms.
Now Eg. 42-8 gives us the binding energy per nucleon as

The radius r is given by Eq. 42-3 (r = mA"), where ro is
1.2 fm (=1.2 x 10-5 m). Substituting for r then leads to

Note that A has canceled out; thus, this equation for density
papplies to any nucleus that can be treated as spherical with
a radius given by Eq. 42-3. Using 1.67 x 10-7 kg for the
mass m of a nucleon, we then have
