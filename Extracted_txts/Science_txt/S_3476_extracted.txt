Here Np is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at some arbitrary initial
time fo. Setting f) = 0 and rearranging Eq. 42-13 give us
N
In=— = -At. 42-14
No (42-14)
Taking the exponential of both sides (the exponential function is the antifunction of
the natural logarithm) leads to
Now
No

or N=Nee™ (radioactive decay), (42-15)

in which Np is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at t = 0 and N is
the number remaining at any subsequent time ¢. Note that lightbulbs (for one
example) follow no such exponential decay law. If we life-test 1000 bulbs, we
expect that they will all “decay” (that is, burn out) at more or less the same time.
The decay of radionuclides follows quite a different law.

We are often more interested in the decay rate R (= —dN/dt) than in N itself.
Differentiating Eq. 42-15, we find

dN
R= ~~ =ANe™
dt ‘0
or R= Re™ (radioactive decay), (42-16)

an alternative form of the law of radioactive decay (Eq. 42-15). Here Ry is the
decay rate at time ¢ = 0 and R is the rate at any subsequent time t. We can now
rewrite Eq. 42-11 in terms of the decay rate R of the sample as

R=AN, (42-17)

where R and the number of radioactive nuclei N that have not yet undergone
decay must be evaluated at the same instant.

The total decay rate R of a sample of one or more radionuclides is called the
activity of that sample. The SI unit for activity is the beequerel, named for Henri
Becquerel, the discoverer of radioactivity:

1 becquerel = 1 Bq = 1 decay per second.
An older unit, the curie, is still in common use:
lcurie = 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10 Bq.

Often a radioactive sample will be placed near a detector that does not record all
the disintegrations that occur in the sample. The reading of the detector under these
circumstances is proportional to (and smaller than) the true activity of the sample.
Such proportional activity measurements are reported not in becquerel units but
simply in counts per unit time.

Lifetimes. There are two common time measures of how long any given type
of radionuclides lasts. One measure is the half-life T,). of a radionuclide, which is
the time at which both N and R have been reduced to one-half their initial values.
The other measure is the mean (or average) life 7, which is the time at which both
Nand R have been reduced to e~! of their initial values.

To relate Tp to the disintegration constant A, we put R = 3Ro in Eq. 42-16
and substitute 7,» for t. We obtain

IR = ReATio
Ro = Roe *.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for T,, we find

Tp = we

Similarly, to relate 7 to A, we put R = e~'Ry in Eq. 42-16, substitute 7 for ¢, and
