Tip =~ = 7in2. (42-18)

e nuclide "I is radioactive, with a half-life of 8.04 days. At noon on January 1, the ac-
tivity of a certain sample is 600 Bq. Using the concept of half-life, without written calcu-
lation, determine whether the activity at noon on January 24 will be a little less than 200
Bg, a little more than 200 Bq, a little less than 75 Bq, or a little more than 75 Bq.

Sample Problem 42.04 Finding the disintegration constant and half-life from a graph

The table that follows shows some measurements of the
decay rate of a sample of 'I, a radionuclide often used
medically as a tracer to measure the rate at which iodine is
absorbed by the thyroid gland.

Find the disintegration constant A and the half-life Ty. for
this radionuclide.

KEY IDEAS

The disintegration constant A determines the exponential rate
at which the decay rate R decreases with time t (as indicated by
Eq. 42-16, R = Roe’). Therefore, we should be able to deter-
mine A by plotting the measurements of R against the mea-
surement times t. However, obtaining A from a plot of R versus
tis difficult because R decreases exponentially with ¢, according
to Eq. 42-16. A neat solution is to transform Eq. 42-16 into a
linear function of t, so that we can easily find A. To do so, we
take the natural logarithms of both sides of Eq. 42-16.
Calculations: We obtain
In R = In(Roe™) = In Ry + In(e™)
= In Ry — At. (42-19)

Because Eq. 42-19 is of the form y = b + mx, with b and m
constants, it is a linear equation giving the quantity In R asa
function of t. Thus, if we plot In R (instead of R) versus t, we

should get a straight line. Further, the slope of the line
should be equal to —A.

Figure 42-9 shows a plot of In R versus time ft for the
given measurements. The slope of the straight line that fits
through the plotted points is

0-62 a
slope = 225 min-0 ~ 0.0276 min™*.
Thus, —A = —0.0276 min
or A = 0.0276 min! ~ 1.7 hb). (Answer)

The time for the decay rate R to decrease by 1/2 is re-
lated to the disintegration constant A via Eq. 42-18 (Ty. =
(In 2)/A). From that equation, we find
