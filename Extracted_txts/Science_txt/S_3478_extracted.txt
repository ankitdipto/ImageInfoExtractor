42-4 ALPHA DECAY 1289

Sample Problem 42.05 Radioactivity of the potassium in a banana

Of the 600 mg of potassium in a large banana, 0.0117% is
radioactive “°K, which has a half-life Ty. of 1.25 x 10°y.
What is the activity of the banana?

KEY IDEAS

(1) We can relate the activity R to the disintegration con-
stant A with Eq. 42-17, but let’s write it as R = AN4o, where
Ny is the number of “K nuclei (and thus atoms) in the ba-
nana. (2) We can relate the disintegration constant to the
known half-life Tj. with Eq. 42-18 (71. = (In 2)/A).

Calculations: Combining Eqs. 42-18 and 42-17 yields

‘We know that N4o is 0.0117 % of the total number N of potas-
sium atoms in the banana. We can find an expression for N
by combining two equations that give the number of moles n
of potassium in the banana. From Eq. 19-2,n = N/N4, where
Na is Avogadro’s number (6.02 x 10? mol~!). From Eq. 19-3,
n= Mgn/M, where Mom is the sample mass (here the given

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to...

42.22 Identify alpha particle and alpha decay.

42.23 For a given alpha decay, calculate the mass change
and the Q of the reaction.

42.24 Determine the change in atomic number Z and mass

600 mg of potassium) and M is the molar mass of potassium.

Combining those two equations to eliminate n, we can write

Ny = (1.17 x 10-4) (42-21)

From Appendix F, we see that the molar mass of potassium
is 39.102 g/mol. Equation 42-21 then yields
4, (600 X 10~4g)(6.02 x 10°? mol!)
= (117 x 10°) <<
ad eee) 39.102 g/mol
= 1.081 x 101.
Substituting this value for Ny and the given half-life of
1.25 X 10° y for Ty into Eq. 42-20 leads to
_ (1.081 x 10!8)(In 2)
(1.25 X 10° y)(3.16 x 107s/y)
= 18.96 Bq ~ 19.0 Bq. (Answer)
This is about 0.51 nCi. Your body always has about 160 g of
potassium. If you repeat our calculation here, you will find
that the “K component of that everyday amount has an ac-
tivity of 5.06 x 10° Bq (or 0.14 uCi). So, eating a banana
adds less than 1% to the radiation your body receives daily
from radioactive potassium.

number A of a nucleus undergoing alpha decay.

42.25 In terms of the potential barrier, explain how an alpha
particle can escape from a nucleus with less energy than
the barrier height.

 

Key Idea

@ Some nuclides decay by emitting an alpha particle (a helium nucleus, “He). Such decay is inhibited by a potential energy

barrier that must be penetrated by tunneling.

 

Alpha Decay

When a nucleus undergoes alpha decay, it transforms to a different nuclide by
emitting an alpha particle (a helium nucleus, ‘He). For example, when uranium

238U undergoes alpha decay, it transforms to thorium 7'Th:
238 > 2M@Th + “He.

(42-22)

This alpha decay of *8U can occur spontaneously (without an external
source of energy) because the total mass of the decay products *“'Th and “He is
less than the mass of the original **U. Thus, the total mass energy of the decay
