17.3
The Mouse

Some of the most elegant investiga-
tions of the cellular mechanisms of
development are being done with
mammals, particularly the mouse
Mus musculus. Mice have a battery of
homeotic genes, the Hox genes (fig-
ure 17.22), which seem to be closely
related to the homeotic genes of
Drosophila. Very interestingly, not
only do the same genes occur, but
they also seem to operate in the
same order! Clearly, the homeotic
gene system has been highly con-
served during the course of animal
evolution.

What lends great power to this
developmental model system is the
ability to create chimeric mice con-
taining cells from two different ge-
netic lines. Mammalian embryos are
unusual among vertebrates in that
they arise from symmetrical eggs;
there are no chemical gradients, and
during the initial cleavage divisions,
all of the daughter cells are identical.
Up to the ecight-cell stage, any one
of the cells, if isolated, will form a
normal adult. Moreover, two differ-
ent eight-cell-stage embryos can be
fused to form a single embryo that
will go on to form a normal adult.
The resulting adult is a chimera,
containing cells from both embryos.
In a very real sense, these chimeric
mice each have four parents!

The Hox genes control body
part development in mice.
