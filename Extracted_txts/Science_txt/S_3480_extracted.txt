42-4 ALPHA DECAY 1291

nently trapped inside the nucleus by the barrier, how can the “*U nucleus ever emit

an alpha particle? The answer is that, as you learned in Module 38-9, there is a finite

probability that a particle can tunnel through an energy barrier that is classically Radionuclide 2 Half-Life
insurmountable. In fact, alpha decay occurs as a result of barrier tunneling. BU 4.25 MeV 45 x 10°y
The very long half-life of 7U tells us that the barrier is apparently not very 28 6.81 MeV 9.1 min

“leaky.” If we imagine that an already-formed alpha particle is rattling back and
forth inside the nucleus, it would arrive at the inner surface of the barrier about 10°8
times before it would succeed in tunneling through the barrier. This is about 10?!
times per second for about 4 X 10° years (the age of Earth)! We, of course, are wait-
ing on the outside, able to count only the alpha particles that do manage to escape
without being able to tell what’s going on inside the nucleus.

We can test this explanation of alpha decay by examining other alpha
emitters. For an extreme contrast, consider the alpha decay of another ura-
nium isotope, *U, which has a disintegration energy Q’ of 6.81 MeV, about
60% higher than that of *°U. (The value of Q’ is also shown as a horizontal
black line in Fig. 42-10.) Recall from Module 38-9 that the transmission coeffi-
cient of a barrier is very sensitive to small changes in the total energy of the
particle seeking to penetrate it. Thus, we expect alpha decay to occur more
readily for this nuclide than for **U. Indeed it does. As Table 42-2 shows, its
half-life is only 9.1 min! An increase in Q by a factor of only 1.6 produces a de-
crease in half-life (that is, in the effectiveness of the barrier) by a factor of 3 x
10". This is sensitivity indeed.

Sample Problem 42.06 Qvalue in an alpha decay, using masses

We are given the following atomic masses:

28U  238.05079u *He 4.002 60u

Th 234.04363u 'H 1.00783 u

27Pa 237.051 21 u
Here Pa is the symbol for the element protactinium
(Z=91).
(a) Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of
28U, The decay process is

Poa eee

Note, incidentally, how nuclear charge is conserved in this
equation: The atomic numbers of thorium (90) and helium
(2) add up to the atomic number of uranium (92). The num-
ber of nucleons is also conserved: 238 = 234 + 4.

KEY IDEA

The energy released in the decay is the disintegration en-
ergy Q, which we can calculate from the change in mass AM
due to the 7U decay.

Calculation: To do this, we use Eq. 37-50,
Q = Mc? — Myc? (42-23)

where the initial mass Mj is that of “U and the final mass
Myis the sum of the 7*Th and *He masses. Using the atomic
masses given in the problem statement, Eq. 42-23 becomes

AWILeY

OQ = (238.050 79 u)c? — (234.043 63 u + 4.002 60 uc?
= (0.004 56 w)c2 = (0.004 56 u)(931.494 013 MeV/u)
= 4.25 MeV. (Answer)

Note that using atomic masses instead of nuclear masses
does not affect the result because the total mass of the elec-
trons in the products subtracts out from the mass of the nu-
cleons + electrons in the original 7*U.

(b) Show that 7%U cannot spontaneously emit a proton;
that is, protons do not leak out of the nucleus in spite of the
proton—proton repulsion within the nucleus.

Solution: If this happened, the decay process would be
pos eae Te

(You should verify that both nuclear charge and the num-
ber of nucleons are conserved in this process.) Using the
same Key Idea as in part (a) and proceeding as we did there,
we would find that the mass of the two decay products

237.051 21 u + 1.007 83 u

would exceed the mass of *8U by Am = 0.008 25 u, with disin-

tegration energy
O = —7.68 MeV.

The minus sign indicates that we must add 7.68 MeV to a *8U.
nucleus before it will emit a proton; it will certainly not do so
spontaneously.
