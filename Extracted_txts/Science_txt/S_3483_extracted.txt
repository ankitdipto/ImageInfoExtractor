Figure 42-13 A portion of the valley of the
nuclides, showing only the nuclides of low
mass. Deuterium, tritium, and helium lie at
the near end of the plot, with helium at the
high point. The valley stretches away from
us, with the plot stopping at about Z = 22
and N = 35. Nuclides with large values of
A, which would be plotted much beyond
the valley, can decay into the valley by re-
peated alpha emissions and by fission
(splitting of a nuclide).

unit MeV/c”. The inclusion of such an axis gives Fig. 42-13, which reveals the
degree of nuclear stability of the nuclides. For the low-mass nuclides, we find a
“valley of the nuclides,” with the stability band of Fig. 42-5 running along its
bottom. Nuclides on the proton-rich side of the valley decay into it by emitting
positrons, and those on the neutron-rich side do so by emitting electrons.

238U decays to 2Th by the emission of an alpha particle. There follows a chain of fur-
ther radioactive decays, either by alpha decay or by beta decay. Eventually a stable
nuclide is reached and, after that, no further radioactive decay is possible. Which of
the following stable nuclides is the end product of the ““U radioactive decay chain:
206P,2""Pb,"8Pb, or Pb? (Hint: You can decide by considering the changes in mass
number A for the two types of decay.)

Sample Problem 42.07 Q value in a beta decay, using masses

Calculate the disintegration energy Q for the beta decay of
*P.as described by Eq. 42-24. The needed atomic masses are
31.973 91 u for *P and 31.972 07 u for °S.

mp and msg represent their atomic masses. Then we can write
the change in mass for the decay of Eq. 42-24 as
Am = (ms +m.) ~ mp,

in which m, is the mass of the electron. If we add and sub-

KEY IDEA tract 15m, on the right side of this equation, we obtain

 

The disintegration energy Q for the beta decay is the
amount by which the mass energy is changed by the decay.
Calculations: Q is given by Eq. 37-50 (Q = —AM c’).
However, we must be careful to distinguish between nuclear
masses (which we do not know) and atomic masses (which
we do know). Let the boldface symbols mp and mg represent
the nuclear masses of *P and “S, and let the italic symbols

Am = (mg + 16m.) — (mp + 15m,).
The quantities in parentheses are the atomic masses of “S
and P; so
Am =ms— m
‘We thus see that if we subtract only the atomic masses, the mass
of the emitted electron is automatically taken into account. (This
procedure will not work for positron emission.)
