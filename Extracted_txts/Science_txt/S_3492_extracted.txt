**17_ Because the neutron has no charge, its mass must be found
in some way other than by using a mass spectrometer. When a neu-
tron anda proton meet (assume both to be almost stationary), they
combine and form a deuteron, emitting a gamma ray whose energy
is 2.2233 MeV. The masses of the proton and the deuteron are
1.007 276 467 u and 2.013 553 212 u, respectively. Find the mass of
the neutron from these data.

*°19 A periodic table might list the average atomic mass of mag-
nesium as being 24.312 u, which is the result of weighting the
atomic masses of the magnesium isotopes according to their natu-
ral abundances on Earth. The three isotopes and their masses are
Mg (23.985 04 u), Mg (24.985 84 u), and Mg (25.982 59 u).
The natural abundance of “Mg is 78.99% by mass (that is, 78.99%
of the mass of a naturally occurring sample of magnesium is due
to the presence of “Mg). What is the abundance of (a) >Mg and

21 SSM www (a) Show that the total binding energy Ey, of a
given nuclide is

Ey. = ZAy + NA, — A,

where Ay is the mass excess of 'H, A, is the mass excess of a neutron,
and A is the mass excess of the given nuclide. (b) Using this method,
calculate the binding energy per nucleon for "Au. Compare your re-
sult with the value listed in Table 42-1. The needed mass excesses,
rounded to three significant figures, are Ay = +7.29 MeV, A, =
+8.07 MeV, and Ajo; = —31.2 MeV. Note the economy of calculation
that results when mass excesses are used in place of the actual
masses.

Module 42-3 Radioactive Decay

°25 Cancer cells are more vulnerable to x and gamma radiation
than are healthy cells. In the past, the standard source for radiation
therapy was radioactive Co, which decays, with a half-life of 5.27
y, into an excited nuclear state of Ni. That nickel isotope then im-
mediately emits two gamma-ray photons, each with an approxi-
mate energy of 1.2 MeV. How many radioactive Co nuclei are
present in a 6000Ci source of the type used in hospitals?
(Energetic particles from linear accelerators are now used in radia-
tion therapy.)
