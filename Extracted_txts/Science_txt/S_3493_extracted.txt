1304 CHAPTER 42 NUCLEAR PHYSICS

*30 The half-life of a particular radioactive isotope is 6.5 h. If
there are initially 48 x 10! atoms of this isotope, how many re-
main at the end of 26 h?

*31 Consider an initially pure 3.4 g sample of “Ga, an isotope
that has a half-life of 78 h. (a) What is its initial decay rate? (b)
What is its decay rate 48 h later?

*32 When aboveground nuclear tests were conducted, the explo-
sions shot radioactive dust into the upper atmosphere. Global air cir-
culations then spread the dust worldwide before it settled out on
ground and water. One such test was conducted in October 1976.
What fraction of the °’Sr produced by that explosion still existed in
October 2006? The half-life of *Sris 29 y.

°°33 The air in some caves includes a significant amount of radon
gas, which can lead to lung cancer if breathed over a prolonged
time. In British caves, the air in the cave with the greatest amount
of the gas has an activity per volume of 1.55 X 10° Bq/m*. Suppose
that you spend two full days exploring (and sleeping in) that cave.
Approximately how many “Rn atoms would you take in and out
of your lungs during your two-day stay? The radionuclide “Rn in
radon gas has a half-life of 3.82 days. You need to estimate your
lung capacity and average breathing rate.

°°34 Calculate the mass of a sample of (initially pure) ““K that
has an initial decay rate of 1.70 X 105 disintegrations/s. The isotope
has a half-life of 1.28 X 10° y.

°°35 SSM A certain radionuclide is being manufactured in a
cyclotron at a constant rate R. It is also decaying with disintegration
constant A. Assume that the production process has been going on
for a time that is much longer than the half-life of the radionuclide.
(a) Show that the number of radioactive nuclei present after such
time remains constant and is given by N = R/A. (b) Now show that
this result holds no matter how many radioactive nuclei were pres-
ent initially. The nuclide is said to be in secular equilibrium with its
source; in this state its decay rate is just equal to its production rate.

36 Plutonium isotope 2°Pu decays by alpha decay with a half-
life of 24 100 y. How many milligrams of helium are produced by
an initially pure 12.0g sample of 2°Pu at the end of 20 000 y?
(Consider only the helium produced directly by the plutonium and
not by any by-products of the decay process.)

37. The radionuclide “Cu has a half-life of 12.7 h. If a sample
contains 5.50 g of initially pure “Cu at ¢ = 0, how much of it will
decay between f = 14.0h andt = 16.0 h?

°°38 A dose of 8.60 «Ci of a radioactive isotope is injected into a
patient. The isotope has a half-life of 3.0 h. How many of the iso-
tope parents are injected?

*°39 The radionuclide **Mn has a half-life of 2.58 h and is pro-
duced in a cyclotron by bombarding a manganese target with
deuterons. The target contains only the stable manganese isotope
‘SMn, and the manganese—deuteron reaction that produces *°Mn is

“Mn + d—*Mn + p.

If the bombardment lasts much longer than the half-life of “Mn,
the activity of the *°Mn produced in the target reaches a final value
of 8.88 X 10" Bq, (a) At what rate is “Mn being produced? (b)
How many “Mn nuclei are then in the target? (c) What is their
total mass?

40 A source contains two phosphorus radionuclides, °P. (Ty) =
14.3d) and SP (Typ = 25.3). Initially, 10.0% of the decays come
from *P. How long must one wait until 90.0% do so?

41 A 1.00 g sample of samarium emits alpha particles at a rate
of 120 particles/s. The responsible isotope is '*’Sm, whose natural
abundance in bulk samarium is 15.0%. Calculate the half-life.

*°42 What is the activity of a 20 ng sample of Kr, which has a
half-life of 1.84 s?

+43 ® A radioactive sample intended for irradiation of a hospital
patient is prepared at a nearby laboratory. The sample has a half-
life of 83.61 h. What should its initial activity be if its activity is to be
7.4 X 108 Bq when it is used to irradiate the patient 24 h later?

44 @ Figure 42-19 shows the decay of parents in a radioactive
sample. The axes are scaled by N, = 2.00 X 10° and 1, = 10.0s.

What is the activity of the sample at t = 27.0 s?

 

Figure 42-19 Problem 44.

*45 In 1992, Swiss police arrested two men who were attempting
to smuggle osmium out of Eastern Europe for a clandestine sale.
However, by error, the smugglers had picked up !3’Cs, Reportedly,
each smuggler was carrying a 1.0 g sample of ""Cs in a pocket! In
(a) bequerels and (b) curies, what was the activity of each sample?
The isotope '5’Cs has a half-life of 30.2 y. (The activities of radio-
isotopes commonly used in hospitals range up to a few millicuries.)

46 The radioactive nuclide Tc can be injected into a patient's
bloodstream in order to monitor the blood flow, measure the blood
volume, or find a tumor, among other goals. The nuclide is pro-
duced in a hospital by a “cow” containing ”Mo, a radioactive nu-
clide that decays to Te with a half-life of 67 h. Once a day,the cow
is “milked” for its ° Tc, which is produced in an excited state by the
Mo; the °Tc de-excites to its lowest energy state by emitting a
gamma-ray photon, which is recorded by detectors placed around
the patient. The de-excitation has a half-life of 6.0 h. (a) By what
process does Mo decay to Tc? (b) If a patient is injected with an
8.2 x 107 Bq sample of Te, how many gamma-ray photons are
initially produced within the patient each second? (c) If the
emission rate of gamma-ray photons from a small tumor that has
collected Tc is 38 per second at a certain time, how many excited-
state °Tc are located in the tumor at that time?

“47 SSM After long effort, in 1902 Marie and Pierre Curie
succeeded in separating from uranium ore the first substantial
quantity of radium, one decigram of pure RaCl,. The radium was
the radioactive isotope Ra, which has a half-life of 1600 y. (a)
How many radium nuclei had the Curies isolated? (b) What was
the decay rate of their sample, in disintegrations per second?
