*49 SSM Generally, more massive nuclides tend to be more un-
stable to alpha decay. For example, the most stable isotope of ura-
nium,?U, has an alpha decay half-life of 4.5 X 10° y. The most stable
isotope of plutonium is Pu with an 8.0 X 107y half-life, and for
curium we have 48Cm and 3.4 X 105 y. When half of an original sam-
ple of SU has decayed, what fraction of the original sample of (a) plu-
tonium and (b) curium is left?

°°50 Large radionuclides emit an alpha particle rather than other
combinations of nucleons because the alpha particle has such a sta-
ble, tightly bound structure. To confirm this statement, calculate
the disintegration energies for these hypothetical decay processes
and discuss the meaning of your findings:

(a) SU > Th + 3He,
(c) SU > Th + 5He.

emitting a particle more massive than an alpha particle. Consider

*53 SSM The cesium isotope '"Cs is present in the fallout from
aboveground detonations of nuclear bombs. Because it decays with a
slow (30.2 y) half-life into 37Ba, releasing considerable energy in the
process, it is of environmental concern. The atomic masses of the Cs
and Ba are 136.9071 and 136.9058 u, respectively; calculate the total
energy released in such a decay.

*54 Some radionuclides decay by capturing one of their own
atomic electrons, a K-shell electron, say. An example is

Ne STi +n Typ = 331d.

and Ex is the binding energy of the vanadium K-shell electron.
(Hint: Put my and my, as the corresponding nuclear masses and then
add in enough electrons to use the atomic masses.)

*58 Two radioactive materials that alpha decay, **U and ?°Th,
and one that beta decays, “°K, are sufficiently abundant in granite
to contribute significantly to the heating of Earth through the de-
cay energy produced. The alpha-decay isotopes give rise to decay
chains that stop when stable lead isotopes are formed. The isotope
“°K has a single beta decay. (Assume this is the only possible decay of
that isotope.) Here is the information:

 

Stable

Parent Mode (y) Point (MeV) (ppm)
238 a 44710? Ph SLT 4
2°Th @ 14110 ph 42.7 13
OK B 1.28109 = “Ca 131 4

In the table Q is the total energy released in the decay of one par-
ent nucleus to the final stable end point and f is the abundance of
the isotope in kilograms per kilogram of granite; ppm means parts
per million. (a) Show that these materials produce energy as heat
at the rate of 1.0 X 10-° W for each kilogram of granite. (b)
Assuming that there is 2.7 x 10”kg of granite in a 20-km-thick
spherical shell at the surface of Earth, estimate the power of this
decay process over all of Earth. Compare this power with the total
solar power intercepted by Earth, 1.7 X 10!7 W.
