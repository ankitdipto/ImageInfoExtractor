emitted, the maximum possible value. What is the kinetic energy
of the recoiling *S atom in this event? (Hint: For the electron it is
necessary to use the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and
linear momentum. The *°S atom is nonrelativistic.)

Module 42-6 Radioactive Dating

*60 A 5.00 charcoal sample from an ancient fire pit has a “C
activity of 63.0 disintegrations/min. A living tree has a '4C activity
of 15.3 disintegrations/min per 1.00 g. The half-life of '4C is 5730 y.
How old is the charcoal sample?

61 The isotope 2U decays to Pb with a half-life of 4.47 x 10°
y- Although the decay occurs in many individual steps, the first step
has by far the longest half-life; therefore, one can often consider
the decay to go directly to lead. That is,

28 — pb + various decay products.

A rock is found to contain 4.20 mg of 7U and 2.135 mg of Pb.
Assume that the rock contained no lead at formation, so all the
lead now present arose from the decay of uranium. How many
atoms of (a) 8U and (b) Pb does the rock now contain? (c) How
many atoms of **U did the rock contain at formation? (d) What is
the age of the rock?

°°62 A particular rock is thought to be 260 million years old. If it
contains 3.70 mg of “*U, how much Pb should it contain? See
Problem 61.

*°63 @ A rock recovered from far underground is found to con-
tain 0.86 mg of *U, 0.15 mg of “Pb, and 1.6 mg of “Ar. How
much “°K will it likely contain? Assume that “°K decays to only
“Ar with a half-life of 1.25 x 10° y. Also assume that **U has a
half-life of 4.47 x 10° y.

64 © The isotope “K can decay to either “Ca or “Ar, assume
both decays have a half-life of 1.26 X 10° y. The ratio of the Ca pro-
duced to the Ar produced is 8.54/1 = 8.54. A sample originally had
only “°K. Itnow has equal amounts of “’K and “Ar; that is, the ratio of
K to Aris 1/1 = 1. How old is the sample? (Hint: Work this like other
radioactive-dating problems, except that this decay has two products.)

Module 42-7. Measuring Radiation Dosage

°65 ssm The nuclide '*Au, with a half-life of 2.70d, is used
in cancer therapy. What mass of this nuclide is required to produce
an activity of 250 Ci?

°66 A radiation detector records 8700 counts in 1.00 min.
Assuming that the detector records all decays, what is the activity
of the radiation source in (a) becquerels and (b) curies?

67 Anorganic sample of mass 4.00 kg absorbs 2.00 mJ via slow
neutron radiation (RBE =5). What is the dose equivalent (mSv)?

“68 A 75kg person receives a whole-body radiation dose of
2.4 x 10~4 Gy, delivered by alpha particles for which the RBE fac-
tor is 12. Calculate (a) the absorbed energy in joules and the dose
equivalent in (b) sieverts and (c) rem.

°°69_ An 85 kg worker at a breeder reactor plant accidentally in-
gests 2.5 mg of “Pu dust. This isotope has a half-life of 24 100 y,
decaying by alpha decay. The energy of the emitted alpha particles
is 5.2 MeV, with an RBE factor of 13. Assume that the plutonium
resides in the worker's body for 12 h (it is eliminated naturally by
the digestive system rather than being absorbed by any of the in-
ternal organs) and that 95% of the emitted alpha particles are
stopped within the body. Calculate (a) the number of plutonium
atoms ingested, (b) the number that decay during the 12 h, (c) the

energy absorbed by the body, (d) the resulting physical dose in
grays, and (e) the dose equivalent in sieverts.

Module 42-8 Nuclear Models

+70 A typical kinetic energy for a nucleon in a middle-mass
nucleus may be taken as 5.00 MeV. To what effective nuclear tem-
perature does this correspond, based on the assumptions of the
collective model of nuclear structure?

°71 A measurement of the energy E of an intermediate nucleus must
be made within the mean lifetime Ar of the nucleus and necessarily car-
ries an uncertainty AE according to the uncertainty principle

AE- At =h.
(a) What is the uncertainty AF in the energy for an intermediate nu-
cleus if the nucleus has a mean lifetime of 10-22 s? (b) Is the nucleus a
compound nucleus?
°72 In the following list of nuclides, identify (a) those with filled
nucleon shells, (b) those with one nucleon outside a filled shell, and
(c) those with one vacancy in an otherwise filled shell: 5, 80, °K,
Ti, ONi, 'Zr, "Mo, Sb, 3Nd,!4Sm, “TI, and "Pb.
73 SsM Consider the three formation processes shown for the
compound nucleus ”’Ne in Fig, 42-14. Here are some of the atomic
and particle masses:

?0Ne 19.992 44u
MP 18.998 40 u
OQ 15.994 91 u

@ 4,002 60u
p 1.00783 u

What energy must (a) the alpha particle, (b) the proton, and (c) the
y-ray photon have to provide 25.0 MeV of excitation energy to the
compound nucleus?

Additional Problems

74 @ Ina certain rock, the ratio of lead atoms to uranium
atoms is 0.300. Assume that uranium has a half-life of 4.47 x 10° y and
that the rock had no lead atoms when it formed. How old is the rock?

75 ssM A certain stable nuclide, after absorbing a neutron, emits
an electron, and the new nuclide splits spontaneously into two al-
pha particles. Identify the nuclide.

76 A typical chest x-ray radiation dose is 250 Sy, delivered by x
rays with an RBE factor of 0.85. Assuming that the mass of the ex-
posed tissue is one-half the patient’s mass of 88 kg, calculate the
energy absorbed in joules.

77 SSM Howmany years are needed to reduce the activity of “C to
0.020 of its original activity? The half-life of “C is 5730 y.

78 @ Radioactive element AA can decay to either element BB or
element CC The decay depends on chance, but the ratio of the result-
ing number of BB atoms to the resulting number of CC atoms is al-
ways 2/1. The decay has a half-life of 8.00 days. We start with a sample
of pure AA. How long must we wait until the number of CC atoms is
1.50 times the number of AA atoms?

79 @© SSM One of the dangers of radioactive fallout from a nu-
clear bombis its Sr, which decays with a 29-year half-life. Because
it has chemical properties much like those of calcium, the stron-
tium, if ingested by a cow, becomes concentrated in the cow’s milk.
Some of the °’Sr ends up in the bones of whoever drinks the milk.
The energetic electrons emitted in the beta decay of Sr damage
the bone marrow and thus impair the production of red blood cells.
A 1 megaton bomb produces approximately 400 g of Sr. If the
fallout spreads uniformly over a 2000 km? area, what ground area
