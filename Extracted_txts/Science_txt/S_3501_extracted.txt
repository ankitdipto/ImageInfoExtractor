As we should expect from Module 42-5, the mass numbers (140 and 94) of the
fragments remain unchanged during these beta-decay processes and the atomic
numbers (initially 54 and 38) increase by unity at each step.

Inspection of the stability band on the nuclidic chart of Fig. 42-5 shows
why the fission fragments are unstable. The nuclide ~°U, which is the fission-
ing nucleus in the reaction of Eq. 43-1, has 92 protons and 236 — 92, or 144,
neutrons, for a neutron/proton ratio of about 1.6. The primary fragments
formed immediately after the fission reaction have about this same
neutron/proton ratio. However, stable nuclides in the middle-mass region
have smaller neutron/proton ratios, in the range of 1.3 to 1.4. The primary
fragments are thus neutron rich (they have too many neutrons) and will eject
a few neutrons, two in the case of the reaction of Eq. 43-1.The fragments that
remain are still too neutron rich to be stable. Beta decay offers a mechanism
for getting rid of the excess neutrons—namely, by changing them into pro-
tons within the nucleus.

We can estimate the energy released by the fission of a high-mass nuclide by
examining the total binding energy per nucleon AF,., before and after the
fission. The idea is that fission can occur because the total mass energy will
decrease; that is, AE,., will increase so that the products of the fission are more
tightly bound. Thus, the energy Q released by the fission is

_ total final _ initial
Q= (cat ina) (ointn a eey) (3-4)

For our estimate, let us assume that fission transforms an initial high-mass nucleus
to two middle-mass nuclei with the same number of nucleons. Then we have

O-= final \ (final number) __ (initial \ / initial number (43-5)

From Fig. 42-7, we see that for a high-mass nuclide (A ~ 240), the binding energy
per nucleon is about 7.6 MeV/nucleon. For middle-mass nuclides (A ~ 120), it

is about 8.5 MeV/nucleon. Thus, the energy released by fission of a high-mass
nuclide to two middle-mass nuclides is

A Model for Nuclear Fission

Soon after the discovery of fission, Niels Bohr and John Wheeler used the col-
lective model of the nucleus (Module 42-8), based on the analogy between a
