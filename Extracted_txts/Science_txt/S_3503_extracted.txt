Figure 43-3 The potential energy at various
stages in the fission process, as predicted
from the collective model of Bohr and
Wheeler. The Q of the reaction (about 200
MeV) and the fission barrier height E, are
both indicated.

Ep is an energy barrier that must be overcome.

Bohr and Wheeler were able to answer this question. Figure 43-3 shows a
graph of the potential energy of the fissioning nucleus at various stages, derived
from their model for the fission process. This energy is plotted against the distor-
tion parameter r, which is a rough measure of the extent to which the oscillating
nucleus departs from a spherical shape. When the fragments are far apart, this pa-
rameter is simply the distance between their centers (Fig. 43-2e).

The energy difference between the initial state (r = 0) and the final state
(r=) of the fissioning nucleus—that is, the disintegration energy Q—is
labeled in Fig. 43-3. The central feature of that figure, however, is that the poten-
tial energy curve passes through a maximum at a certain value of r. Thus, there is
a potential barrier of height E, that must be surmounted (or tunneled through)
before fission can occur. This reminds us of alpha decay (Fig. 42-10), which is also
a process that is inhibited by a potential barrier.

We see then that fission will occur only if the absorbed neutron provides
an excitation energy E, great enough to overcome the barrier. This energy E,
need not be quite as great as the barrier height E;, because of the possibility of
quantum-physics tunneling.

Table 43-2 shows, for four high-mass nuclides, this test of whether capture
of a thermal neutron can cause fissioning. For each nuclide, the table shows
both the barrier height E,, of the nucleus that is formed by the neutron capture
and the excitation energy E, due to the capture. The values of E,, are calculated
from the theory of Bohr and Wheeler. The values of E, are calculated from the
change in mass energy due to the neutron capture.

For an example of the calculation of E,, we can go to the first line in the
table, which represents the neutron capture process

5U + n> SU,

The masses involved are 235.043 922u for *5U, 1.008665u for the neutron,
and 236.045 562u for *°U. It is easy to show that, because of the neutron
capture, the mass decreases by 7.025 x 10°? u. Thus, energy is transferred from mass
energy to excitation energy E,. Multiplying the change in mass by c? (= 931.494 013
MeViu) gives us E, = 6.5 MeV, which is listed on the first line of the table.

The first and third results in Table 43-2 are historically profound because they
are the reasons the two atomic bombs used in World War II contained 7U (first
bomb) and *°Pu (second bomb). That is, for *°U and Pu, E, > E;. This means that
fission by absorption of a thermal neutron is predicted to occur for these nuclides.
For the other two nuclides in Table 43-2 ?U and *“Am), we have E, < E;; thus,
