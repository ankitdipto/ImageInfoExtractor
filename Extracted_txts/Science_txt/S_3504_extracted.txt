Figure 43-4 This image has transfixed the world since World War II. When Robert
Oppenheimer, the head of the scientific team that developed the atomic bomb,
witnessed the first atomic explosion, he quoted from a sacred Hindu text: “Now I am
become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”

there is not enough energy from a thermal neutron for the excited nucleus to sur-
mount the barrier or to tunnel through it effectively. Instead of fissioning, the nu-
cleus gets rid of its excitation energy by emitting a gamma-ray photon.

The nuclides *°U and Am can be made to fission, however, if they absorb
a substantially energetic (rather than a thermal) neutron. A **U nucleus, for
example, might fission if it happens to absorb a neutron of at least 1.3 MeV ina
so-called fast fission process (“fast” because the neutron is fast).

The two atomic bombs used in World War II depended on the ability of
thermal neutrons to cause many high-mass nuclides in the cores of the bombs to
fission nearly all at once. The process is initiated by a neutron emitter such as
beryllium. After its emitted thermal neutrons cause the fission of the first set of
>35U, each fission releases more thermal neutrons, which cause more *U to fis-
sion and release thermal neutrons. This chain reaction would rapidly spread
through the U in the bomb, resulting in an explosive and devastating output of
energy. Researchers knew that 7%U would work, but they had refined only
enough for one bomb from uranium ore, which consists mainly of **U, which
thermal neutrons will not fission. As the first bomb was being deployed, a °Pu
bomb was tested successfully in New Mexico (Fig. 43-4), so the next deployed
bomb contained *°Pu rather than >*U.
