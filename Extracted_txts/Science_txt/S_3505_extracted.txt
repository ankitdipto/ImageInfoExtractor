Sample Problem 43.01

Find the disintegration energy Q for the fission event of
Eg. 43-1, taking into account the decay of the fission frag-
ments as displayed in Eqs. 43-2 and 43-3. Some needed
atomic and particle masses are

23 235.0439u Ce 139.9054 u
n 1.00866u “Zr 93.9063 u
KEY IDEAS

(1) The disintegration energy Q is the energy transferred
from mass energy to kinetic energy of the decay products.
(2) OQ = —Amc?, where Amis the change in mass.

Calculations: Because we are to include the decay of the
fission fragments, we combine Eqs. 43-1, 43-2, and 43-3 to
write the overall transformation as

BU => ENOa 4 “ae +> mm, (43-7)

Only the single neutron appears here because the initiating
neutron on the left side of Eq. 43-1 cancels one of the two

neutrons on the right of that equation. The mass difference
for the reaction of Eq. 43-7 is

Am = (139.9054 u + 93.9063 u + 1.008 66 u)
— (235.0439 u)
= —0.223 54u,
and the corresponding disintegration energy is

Q = —Amc? = —(—0.223 54 u)(931.494 013 MeV/u)

= 208 MeV, (Answer)
which is in good agreement with our estimate of Eq. 43-6.

If the fission event takes place in a bulk solid, most of
this disintegration energy, which first goes into kinetic en-
ergy of the decay products, appears eventually as an in-
crease in the internal energy of that body, revealing itself
as a rise in temperature. Five or six percent or so of the dis-
integration energy, however, is associated with neutrinos
that are emitted during the beta decay of the primary fis-
sion fragments. This energy is carried out of the system and
is lost.

@ A nuclear reactor uses a controlled chain reaction of fission events to generate electrical power.

The Nuclear Reactor

For large-scale energy release due to fission, one fission event must trigger oth-
ers, so that the process spreads throughout the nuclear fuel like flame through a
log. The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed raises
the possibility of just such a chain reaction, with each neutron that is produced
potentially triggering another fission. The reaction can be either rapid (as in a
nuclear bomb) or controlled (as in a nuclear reactor).

Suppose that we wish to design a reactor based on the fission of °U by
thermal neutrons. Natural uranium contains 0.7% of this isotope, the remaining
99.3% being *°U, which is not fissionable by thermal neutrons. Let us give our-
