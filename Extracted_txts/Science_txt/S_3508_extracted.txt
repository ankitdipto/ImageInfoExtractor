43-2 THE NUCLEAR REACTOR

transfers energy at high temperature and pressure (possibly 600 K and 150 atm)
from the hot reactor core to the steam generator, which is part of the secondary
loop. In the steam generator, evaporation provides high-pressure steam to oper-
ate the turbine that drives the electric generator. To complete the secondary
loop, low-pressure steam from the turbine is cooled and condensed to water and
forced back into the steam generator by a pump. To give some idea of scale, a
typical reactor vessel for a 1000 MW (electric) plant may be 12 m high and weigh
4 MN. Water flows through the primary loop at a rate of about 1 ML/min.

An unavoidable feature of reactor operation is the accumulation of radio-
active wastes, including both fission products and heavy transuranic nuclides such
as plutonium and americium. One measure of their radioactivity is the rate at
which they release energy in thermal form. Figure 43-7 shows the thermal power
generated by such wastes from one year’s operation of a typical large nuclear
plant. Note that both scales are logarithmic. Most “spent” fuel rods from power
reactor operation are stored on site, immersed in water; permanent secure stor-
age facilities for reactor waste have yet to be completed. Much weapons-derived
radioactive waste accumulated during World War II and in subsequent years is

Sample Problem 43.02 Nuclear reactor: efficiency, fission rate, consumption rate

A large electric generating station is powered by a pressurized-
water nuclear reactor. The thermal power produced in the re-
actor core is 3400 MW, and 1100 MW of electricity is generated
by the station. The fuel charge is 8.60 X 10*kg of uranium, in
the form of uranium oxide, distributed among 5.70 x 10* fuel
rods. The uranium is enriched to 3.0% *U.

(a) What is the station’s efficiency?

KEY IDEA

 

The efficiency for this power plant or any other energy de-
vice is given by this: Efficiency is the ratio of the output
power (rate at which useful energy is provided) to the input
power (rate at which energy must be supplied).

Calculation: Here the efficiency (eff) is

__useful output _ 1100 MW (electric)

~-energyinput 3400 MW (thermal)

= 0.32, or 32%. (Answer)
The efficiency—as for all power plants—is controlled by
the second law of thermodynamics. To run this plant, energy

at the rate of 3400 MW — 1100 MW, or 2300 MW, must be
discharged as thermal energy to the environment.

(b) At what rate R do fission events occur in the reactor core?

KEY IDEAS

 

1. The fission events provide the input power P of 3400 MW
(=34 x 10° Js).

2. From Eg. 43-6, the energy Q released by each event is
about 200 MeV.

Calculation: For steady-state operation (P is constant), we
find

r= Z -( 3.4 x 10° I/s )( 1 MeV )
Q — \ 200 MeVifission / 1.60 x 10° J

(c) At what rate (in kilograms per day) is the 7°U fuel dis-
appearing? Assume conditions at start-up.

KEY IDEA

235U) disappears due to two processes: (1) the fission process
with the rate calculated in part (b) and (2) the nonfission
capture of neutrons at about one-fourth that rate.

Calculations: The total rate at which the number of atoms
of 2*U decreases is

(1 + 0.25)(1.06 x 10? atoms/s) = 1.33 x 10° atoms/s.

We want the corresponding decrease in the mass of the *°U.
fuel. We start with the mass of each *°U atom. We cannot use
the molar mass for uranium listed in Appendix F because that
molar mass is for “U, the most common uranium isotope.
Instead, we shall assume that the mass of each 75U atom in
atomic mass units is equal to the mass number A. Thus, the
mass of each **U atom is 235 u (= 3.90 x 10 kg). Then
the rate at which the >*U fuel disappears is

(d) At this rate of fuel consumption, how long would the
fuel supply of ?°U last?
