43-5 THERMONUCLEAR FUSION IN THE SUN AND OTHER STARS 1325

six gamma-ray photons. That is,

4'H + 2e° > “He + 2v + 6y. (43-10)
Let us now add two electrons to each side of Eq. 43-10, obtaining
(41H + 4e~) > (“He + 2e7) + 2v + 6y. (43-11)

The quantities in the two sets of parentheses then represent atoms (not bare
nuclei) of hydrogen and of helium. That allows us to compute the energy release
in the overall reaction of Eq. 43-10 (and Eq. 43-11) as

Q=-Amc?
= —[4.002 603 u — (4)(1.007 825 u)][931.5 MeV/u]
= 26.7 MeV,

in which 4.002 603 u is the mass of a helium atom and 1.007 825 u is the mass of a hy-
drogen atom. Neutrinos have a negligibly small mass, and gamma-ray photons have
no mass; thus, they do not enter into the calculation of the disintegration energy.

This same value of Q follows (as it must) from adding up the Q values for the
separate steps of the proton—proton cycle in Fig. 43-11.Thus,

Q = (2)(0.42 MeV) + (2)(1.02 MeV) + (2)(5.49 MeV) + 12.86 MeV
= 26.7 MeV.

About 0.5 MeV of this energy is carried out of the Sun by the two neutrinos indi-
cated in Eqs. 43-10 and 43-11; the rest (= 26.2 MeV) is deposited in the core of
the Sun as thermal energy. That thermal energy is then gradually transported to
the Sun’s surface, where it is radiated away from the Sun as electromagnetic
waves, including visible light.

Hydrogen burning has been going on in the Sun for about 5 x 10° y, and
calculations show that there is enough hydrogen left to keep the Sun going for about
the same length of time into the future. In 5 billion years, however, the Sun’s core,
which by that time will be largely helium, will begin to cool and the Sun will start to
collapse under its own gravity. This will raise the core temperature and cause the
outer envelope to expand, turning the Sun into whatis called a red giant.

If the core temperature increases to about 10* K again, energy can be produced
through fusion once more—this time by burning helium to make carbon. As a star
evolves further and becomes still hotter, other elements can be formed by other fu-
sion reactions. However, elements more massive than those near the peak of the
binding energy curve of Fig. 42-7 cannot be produced by further fusion processes.

Elements with mass numbers beyond the peak are thought to be formed by neu-
tron capture during cataclysmic stellar explosions that we call supernovas (Fig. 43-12).

known as Sanduleak, as
it appeared until 1987.
(b) We then began to
intercept light from the
star’s supernova, desig-
nated SN1987a; the ex-
plosion was 100 million
times brighter than our
Sun and could be seen
with the unaided eye
even through it was
outside our Galaxy.
