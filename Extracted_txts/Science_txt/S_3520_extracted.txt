ing to Eq. 43-1, the resulting “Xe and “Sr nuclei are just touching

43-14), 4.0% of which actually undergoes fission. (a) What is the
mass of the uranium in the bomb? (It is not 66 kilotons—that is
the amount of released energy specified in terms of the mass of
TNT required to produce the same amount of energy.) (b) How
many primary fission fragments are produced? (c) How many fis-
sion neutrons generated are released to the environment? (On ay-
erage, each fission produces 2.5 neutrons.)

Module 43-2 The Nuclear Reactor

*18 A 200 MW fission reactor consumes half its fuel in 3.00 y.
How much 7*U did it contain initially? Assume that all the energy
generated arises from the fission of *°U and that this nuclide is
consumed only by the fission process.

*°19 The neutron generation time f,., in a reactor is the average
time needed for a fast neutron emitted in one fission event to be
slowed to thermal energies by the moderator and then initiate an-
other fission event. Suppose the power output of a reactor at time
t = 0 is Py. Show that the power output a time f later is P(t), where
P(t) = P kien and k is the multiplication factor. For constant
power output, k = 1.

20 A reactor operates at 400 MW with a neutron generation
time (see Problem 19) of 30.0 ms. If its power increases for 5.00
min with a multiplication factor of 1.0003, what is the power output
at the end of the 5.00 min?

 

21 The thermal energy generated when radiation from radionu-
clides is absorbed in matter can serve as the basis for a small power
source for use in satellites, remote weather stations, and other iso-
lated locations. Such radionuclides are manufactured in abundance
in nuclear reactors and may be separated chemically from the spent
fuel. One suitable radionuclide is *“Pu (Ty. = 87.7 y), which is an
alpha emitter with Q = 5.50 MeV. At what rate is thermal energy
generated in 1.00 kg of this material?

*°22 The neutron generation time f,., (see Problem 19) in a par-
ticular reactor is 1.0 ms. If the reactor is operating at a power level
of 500 MW, about how many free neutrons are present in the reac-
tor at any moment?

23 SSM WWW The neutron generation time (see Problem 19)
of a particular reactor is 1.3 ms. The reactor is generating energy at
the rate of 1200.0 MW. To perform certain maintenance checks, the
power level must temporarily be reduced to 350.00 MW. It is de-
sired that the transition to the reduced power level take 2.6000 s.
To what (constant) value should the multiplication factor be set to
effect the transition in the desired time?

24 (See Problem 21.) Among the many fission products that
may be extracted chemically from the spent fuel of a nuclear reac-
tor is ®Sr (Ty = 29 y). This isotope is produced in typical large re-
actors at the rate of about 18 kg/y. By its radioactivity, the isotope
generates thermal energy at the rate of 0.93 W/g. (a) Calculate the
effective disintegration energy Q.r associated with the decay of a
Sr nucleus. (This energy Q,,; includes contributions from the de-
cay of the "Sr daughter products in its decay chain but not from
neutrinos, which escape totally from the sample.) (b) It is desired
to construct a power source generating 150 W (electric power) to
use in operating electronic equipment in an underwater acoustic
