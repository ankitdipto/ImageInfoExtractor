Find AK/K for each of the following acting as the stationary atom:
(b) hydrogen, (c) deuterium, (d) carbon, and (e) lead. (f) If
K = 1.00 MeV initially, how many such head-on collisions would it
take to reduce the neutron’s kinetic energy to a thermal value
(0.025 eV) if the stationary atoms it collides with are deuterium, a
commonly used moderator? (In actual moderators, most collisions
are not head-on.)

Module 43-3 A Natural Nuclear Reactor
°26 How long ago was the ratio U/?¥U in natural uranium de-
posits equal to 0.15?

°27 The natural fission reactor discussed in Module 43-3 is esti-
mated to have generated 15 gigawatt-years of energy during its
lifetime. (a) If the reactor lasted for 200 000 y, at what average
power level did it operate? (b) How many kilograms of 25U did it
consume during its lifetime?

*°28 Some uranium samples from the natural reactor site de-
scribed in Module 43-3 were found to be slightly enriched in 7*U,
rather than depleted. Account for this in terms of neutron absorp-
tion by the abundant isotope ***U and the subsequent beta and
alpha decay of its products.

fissionable U, too little to make reactor fuel for thermal-neutron.

Both 25U (Ty) = 7.0 X 108 y) and 28U (Ty = 4.5 X 10° y) are ra-

beena practical reactor fuel, with a*U/*U ratio of 3.0%?

Module 43-4 Thermonuclear Fusion: The Basic Process
°30 Verify that the fusion of 1.0 kg of deuterium by the reaction

29 +?H {He +n (Q = +3.27 MeV)

could keep a 100 W lamp burning for 2.5 x 10+ y.

°31 ssM Calculate the height of the Coulomb barrier for the
head-on collision of two deuterons, with effective radius 2.1 fm.

°°32 For overcoming the Coulomb barrier for fusion, methods
other than heating the fusible material have been suggested. For
example, if you were to use two particle accelerators to accelerate
two beams of deuterons directly toward each other so as to collide
head-on, (a) what voltage would each accelerator require in order
for the colliding deuterons to overcome the Coulomb barrier? (b)
Why do you suppose this method is not presently used?

*°33 Calculate the Coulomb barrier height for two Li nuclei that
are fired at each other with the same initial kinetic energy K. (Hint:
Use Eq. 42-3 to calculate the radii of the nuclei.)

unit energy for particles, is

kinetic energy equal to kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and
T is the absolute temperature. If T = 1 X 10’ K, what (approxi-
mately) is the least separation any two protons can have?

rate 3.9 X 10°° W, (a) At what rate is its mass changing? (b) What
fraction of its original mass has it lost in this way since it began to
burn hydrogen, about 4.5 X 10° y ago?

°38 We have seen that Q for the overall proton—proton fusion
cycle is 26.7 MeV. How can you relate this number to the Q values
for the reactions that make up this cycle, as displayed in Fig. 43-11?

fuse to form "°C is 7.27 MeV. The atomic mass of “He is 4.0026 u,
and that of Cis 12.0000 u.

of 1.0 kg of hydrogen deep within the Sun and (b) the fission of 1.0
kg of °U ina fission reactor.

100% helium composition. Next it converts the helium to carbon
via the triple-alpha process,

4He + ‘He + ‘He > ?C + 7.27 MeV.

The mass of the star is 4.6 X 10* kg, and it generates energy at the
rate of 5.3 X 10*° W. How long will it take to convert all the helium
to carbon at this rate?
