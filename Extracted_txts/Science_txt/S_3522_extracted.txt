an imploding, compressive shock wave on the deuterium. The fu-
sion reaction is

see Problem 42. (b) Calculate the rating (see Problem 16) of the fu-
sion part of the bomb if it contains 500 kg of deuterium, 30.0% of
which undergoes fusion.

°°44 Assume that the core of the Sun has one-eighth of the Sun’s
mass and is compressed within a sphere whose radius is one-fourth
of the solar radius. Assume further that the composition of the core
is 35% hydrogen by mass and that essentially all the Sun’s energy
is generated there. If the Sun continues to burn hydrogen at the
current rate of 6.2 X 10! kg/s, how long will it be before the hydro-
gen is entirely consumed? The Sun’s mass is 2.0 X 10% kg,

“heavy water,” in which one of the two hydrogens in an H,O mole-
cule is replaced with deuterium, 7H. How much average fusion
power could be obtained if we “burned” all the 7H in 1.00 liter of
water in 1.00 day by somehow causing the deuterium to fuse via
the reaction?H + 7H He + n?

to lose 0.10% of its mass?

51 Many fear that nuclear power reactor technology will
increase the likelihood of nuclear war because reactors can be used
not only to produce electrical energy but also, as a by-product
through neutron capture with inexpensive **U, to make *°Pu,
which is a “fuel” for nuclear bombs. What simple series of reactions
involving neutron capture and beta decay would yield this pluto-
nium isotope?

52 In the deuteron—triton fusion reaction of Eq. 43-15, what is the
kinetic energy of (a) the alpha particle and (b) the neutron? Neglect
the relatively small kinetic energies of the two combining particles.

with matter at room temperature, 300 K, have an average kinetic
energy of about 0.04 eV.

54 Verify that, as reported in Table 43-1, fissioning of the SU in
1.0 kg of UO, (enriched so that **U is 3.0% of the total uranium)

and 65% helium by mass. (a) What is the number density of pro-
tons there? (b) What is the ratio of that proton density to the den-
sity of particles in an ideal gas at standard temperature (0°C) and
pressure (1.01 X 105 Pa)?

57 The uncompressed radius of the fuel pellet of Sample
Problem 43.05 is 20 um. Suppose that the compressed fuel pellet
“burns” with an efficiency of 10%—that is, only 10% of the
deuterons and 10% of the tritons participate in the fusion reaction
of Eq. 43-15. (a) How much energy is released in each such mi-
croexplosion of a pellet? (b) To how much TNT is each such pellet
equivalent? The heat of combustion of TNT is 4.6 MJ/kg. (c) If a
fusion reactor is constructed on the basis of 100 microexplosions
per second, what power would be generated? (Part of this power
would be used to operate the lasers.)
