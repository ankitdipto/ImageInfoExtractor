charged particles counterclockwise and the tracks of negatively charged parti-
cles clockwise. By measuring the radius of curvature of a track, we can calculate
the momentum of the particle that made it. Table 44-1 shows some properties of
the particles and antiparticles that participated in the event of Fig. 44-2a, in-
cluding those that did not make tracks. Following common practice, we express
the masses of the particles listed in Table 44-1—and in all other tables in this
chapter—in the unit MeV/c. The reason for this notation is that the rest en-
ergy of a particle is needed more often than its mass. Thus, the mass of a proton
is shown in Table 44-1 to be 938.3 Me V/c?. To find the proton’s rest energy, mul-
tiply this mass by c? to obtain 938.3 MeV.

The general tools used for the analysis of photographs like Fig. 44-2a are the
laws of conservation of energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and elec-
tric charge, along with other conservation laws that we have not yet discussed.
Figure 44-2a is actually one of a stereo pair of photographs so that, in practice,
these analyses are carried out in three dimensions.

The event of Fig. 44-2a is triggered by an energetic antiproton (p) that,
generated in an accelerator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, enters the
chamber from the left. There are three separate subevents; one occurs at point 1
in Fig. 44-2b, the second occurs at point 2, and the third occurs out of the frame of
the figure. Let’s examine each:

1. Proton—Antiproton Annihilation. At point 1 in Fig. 44-2b, the initiating
antiproton (blue track) slams into a proton of the liquid hydrogen in the cham-
ber, and the result is mutual annihilation. We can tell that annihilation
occurred while the incoming antiproton was in flight because most of the
particles generated in the encounter move in the forward direction—that is,
toward the right in Fig. 44-2. From the principle of conservation of linear
momentum, the incoming antiproton must have had a forward momentum
when it underwent annihilation. Further, because the particles are charged
and moving through a magnetic field, the curvature of the paths reveal
whether the particles are negatively charged (like the incident antiproton) or
positively charged (Fig. 44-2c).

The total energy involved in the collision of the antiproton and the pro-
ton is the sum of the antiproton’s kinetic energy and the two (identical) rest
energies of those two particles (2 x 938.3 MeV, or 1876.6 MeV). This is
enough energy to create a number of lighter particles and give them kinetic
energy. In this case, the annihilation produces four positive pions (red tracks
in Fig. 44-2b) and four negative pions (green tracks). (For simplicity, we
assume that no gamma-ray photons, which would leave no tracks because
they lack electric charge, are produced.) Thus we conclude that the annihila-
tion process is

ptprda' +4. (44-6)

We see from Table 44-1 that the positive pions (z*) are particles and the neg-
ative pions (7 ) are antiparticles. The reaction of Eq. 44-6 is a strong interac-
