CHAPTER 44 QUARKS, LEPTONS, AND THE BIG BANG

antimuon, the positron, and the neutrino are each a with only one neutrino,
the net component S- of spin angular momentum could not be conserved in the
antimuon decay of Eq. 44-8. In Module 44-2 we shall discuss another reason.

Sample Problem 44.01
A stationary positive pion can decay according to

Top ty
What is the kinetic energy of the antimuon ,.*? What is the

kinetic energy of the neutrino?

KEY IDEA

 

The pion decay process must conserve both total energy and
total linear momentum.
Energy conservation: Let us first write the conservation of
total energy (rest energy mc? plus kinetic energy K) for the
decay process as
mc? + K,=m,c> + K, + m,c? + K,,
Because the pion was stationary, its kinetic energy K, is
zero. Then, using the masses listed for m,, m,, and m, in
Table 44-1, we find
K, + K,=m,¢ — mc? ~ me
= 139.6 MeV — 105.7 MeV — 0
= 33.9 MeV,

where we have approximated m, as zero.

(44-9)

Momentum conservation: We cannot solve Eq. 44-9 for ei-
ther K,, or K, separately, and so let us next apply the princi-
ple of conservation of linear momentum to the decay
process. Because the pion is stationary when it decays, that
principle requires that the muon and neutrino move in oppo-
site directions after the decay. Assume that their motion is
along an axis. Then, for components along that axis, we can
write the conservation of linear momentum for the decay as

which, with p, = 0, gives us

Pu=—Pr (44-10)
Relating p and K: We want to relate these momenta p,, and
—p, to the kinetic energies K,, and K,,so that we can solve for
the kinetic energies. Because we have no reason to believe
that classical physics can be applied, we use Eq. 37-54, the
momentum—kinetic energy relation from special relativity:

(pc)? = K? + 2Kmc?. (44-11)
From Eq. 44-10, we know that
(pac? = (pe) (44-12)

Substituting from Eq. 44-11 for each side of Eq. 44-12
yields
Ki, + 2K,m,c = K?, + 2K,m,c.

Approximating the neutrino mass to be m, = 0, substituting
K, = 33.9 MeV — K,, from Eq. 44-9, and then solving for
K,, we find
_ (33.9 MeV)?
~ (2)(33.9 MeV + myc’)

(33.9 MeV)?

~ (2)(3.9 MeV + 105.7 MeV)
= 4.12 MeV.

(Answer)
The kinetic energy of the neutrino is then, from Eq. 44-9,
K, = 33.9 MeV — K,, = 33.9 MeV — 4.12 MeV
= 29.8 MeV. (Answer)

We see that, although the magnitudes of the momenta of the
two recoiling particles are the same, the neutrino gets the
larger share (88%) of the kinetic energy.

Sample Problem 44.02 Qina proton-pion reaction

The protons in the material filling a bubble chamber are
bombarded with a beam of high-energy antiparticles
known as negative pions. At collision points, a proton anda
pion transform into a negative kaon and a positive sigma
in this reaction:

The Q ofa reaction is

Calculation: For the given reaction, we find
Q = (m,c? + myc?) — (gc? + msc’)
