The violent head-on collision of two 30 GeV
beams of gold atoms in the RHIC
accelerator at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory. In the moment of collision, a gas
of individual quarks and gluons was created.

of the eight spin-} baryons plotted in

Fig. 44-3a. (Although the two central
baryons share the same quark structure,
they are different particles. The sigma is an
excited state of the lambda, decaying into
the lambda by emission of a gamma-ray
photon.) (b) The quark compositions of the
nine spin-zero mesons plotted in Fig. 44-3.

“All quarks (including antiquarks) have spin } and thus are fermions. The quantum numbers q,S,
and B for each antiquark are the negatives of those for the corresponding quark.

as convenient labels. Collectively, these names are called the quark flavors. We
could just as well call them vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry instead of up, down,
and strange. Some properties of the quarks are displayed in Table 44-5.

The fractional charge quantum numbers of the quarks may jar you a little.
However, withhold judgment until you see how neatly these fractional charges ac-
count for the observed integer charges of the mesons and the baryons. In all normal
situations, whether here on Earth or in an astronomical process, quarks are always
bound up together in twos or threes (and perhaps more) for reasons that are still not
well understood. Such requirements are our normal rule for quark combinations.

An exciting exception to the normal rule occurred in experiments at the
RHIC particle collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. At the spot
where two high-energy beams of gold nuclei collided head-on, the kinetic energy
of the particles was so large that it matched the kinetic energy of particles that
were present soon after the beginning of the universe (as we discuss in Module
44-4). The protons and neutrons of the gold nuclei were ripped apart to form a
momentary gas of individual quarks. (The gas also contained gluons, the particles
that normally hold quarks together.) These experiments at RHIC may be the first
time that quarks have been set free of one another since the universe began.

Quarks and Baryons

Each baryon is a combination of three quarks; some of the combinations are
given in Fig. 44-4a. With regard to baryon number, we see that any three quarks
(each with B = +4) yield a proper baryon (with B = +1).

Charges also work out, as we can see from three examples. The proton has a
quark composition of uud, and so its charge quantum number is

q(wud) = 3+ 3+ (Y= +h

The neutron has a quark composition of udd, and its charge quantum number is
therefore

q(udd) = 3 + (—3) + (-3) = 0.
The }~ (sigma-minus) particle has a quark composition of dds, and its charge
quantum number is therefore
a(dds) = ~} + (-) + (-) = 1.

The strangeness quantum numbers work out as well. You can check this by
using Table 44-3 for the }~ strangeness number and Table 44-5 for the strange-
ness numbers of the dds quarks.
