3.2 Proteins perform the chemistry of the cell.

The Many Functions of Proteins

We will begin our discussion of macromolecules that make
up the bodies of organisms with proteins (see table 3.1). The
proteins within living organisms are immensely diverse in
structure and function (table 3.2 and figure 3.4).

1. Enzyme catalysis. We have already encountered
one class of proteins, enzymes, which are biological
catalysts that facilitate specific chemical reactions. Be-
cause of this property, the appearance of enzymes was
one of the most important events in the evolution of
life. Enzymes are globular proteins, with a three-
dimensional shape that fits snugly around the chemi-

cals they work on, facilitating chemical reactions by
stressing particular chemical bonds.

2. Defense. Other globular proteins use their shapes
to “recognize” foreign microbes and cancer cells.
These cell surface receptors form the core of the
body’s hormone and immune systems.

3. Transport. A variety of globular proteins transport
specific small molecules and ions. The transport pro-
tein hemoglobin, for example, transports oxygen in
the blood, and myoglobin, a similar protein, transports
oxygen in muscle. Iron is transported in blood by the
protein transferrin.
