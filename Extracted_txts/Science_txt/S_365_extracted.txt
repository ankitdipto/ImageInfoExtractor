Kinds of Cancer

Cancer can occur in almost any tissue,
so a bewildering number of different
cancers occur. Tumors arising from

cancer is still a mystery, although in Malignant melanoma
1994 and 1995 researchers isolated
two genes responsible for hereditary
susceptibility to breast cancer, BRCAI
and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer genes #1
and #2 located on human chromo-
somes 17 and 13); their discovery of-
fers hope that researchers will soon be
able to unravel the fundamental mechanism leading to
hereditary breast cancer, about one-third of all breast
cancers.

The association of particular chemicals with cancer,
particularly chemicals that are potent mutagens, led re-
searchers early on to the suspicion that cancer might be
caused, at least in part, by chemicals, the so-called chem-
ical carcinogenesis theory. Agents thought to cause
cancer are called carcinogens. A simple and effective
way to test if a chemical is mutagenic is the Ames test
(figure 18.10), named for its developer, Bruce Ames. The
test uses a strain of Salmonella bacteria that has a defec-
tive histidine-synthesizing gene. Because these bacteria
cannot make histidine, they cannot grow on media without
it. Only a back-mutation that restores the ability to manu-
facture histidine will permit growth. Thus the number of
colonies of these bacteria that grow on histidine-free
medium is a measure of the frequency of back-mutation. A
majority of chemicals that cause back-mutations in this
test are carcinogenic, and vice versa. To increase the sen-
sitivity of the test, the strains of bacteria are altered to
disable their DNA repair machinery. The search for the
cause of cancer has focused in part on chemical carcino-
gens and other environmental factors, including ionizing
radiation such as X rays (figure 18.11).

Cancers occur in all tissues, but are more common in
some than others.

In the United States in 1999 there were 1,221,800 reported cases of new cancers and 563,100 cancer
deaths, indicating that roughly half the people who develop cancer die from it.

The Ames test. This test is uses a strain of Salmonella bacteria
that requires histidine in the growth medium due to a mutated
gene. If a suspected carcinogen is mutagenic, it can reverse this
mutation. Rat liver extract is added because it contains enzymes
that can convert carcinogens into mutagens. The mutagenicity of
the carcinogen can be quantified by counting the number of
bacterial colonies that grow on a medium lacking histidine.
