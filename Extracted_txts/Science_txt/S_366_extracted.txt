Potential cancer-causing agents. (a) The incidence of cancer per 1000 people is not uniform throughout the United States. The
incidence is higher in cities and in the Mississippi Delta, suggesting that pollution and pesticide runoff may contribute to the development
of cancer. (b) One of the deadliest cancers in the United States, cancer of the large intestine, is uncommon in many other countries. Its
incidence appears to be related to the amount of meat a person consumes: a high-meat diet slows the passage of food through the intestine,
prolonging exposure of the intestinal wall to digestive waste. (¢) The biggest killer among cancers is lung cancer, and the most deadly
environmental agent producing lung cancer is cigarette smoke. The incidence of lung cancer among men 35 to 44 years of age in various
countries strongly correlates with the cigarette consumption in that country 20 years earlier.
