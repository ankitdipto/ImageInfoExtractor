Some of the more common structural proteins. (a) Collagen: strings of a tennis racket from gut tissue; (J) fibrin: scanning electron
micrograph of a blood clot (3000x); (0) keratin: a peacock feather; (d) silk: a spider’s web; (¢) keratin: human hair.

tural roles; these structural proteins (see figure 3.4) in-
clude keratin in hair, fibrin in blood clots, and col-
lagen, which forms the matrix of skin, ligaments,
tendons, and bones and is the most abundant protein
ina vertebrate body.

tion of two kinds of protein filament: actin and myo-

Small proteins called hormones serve
as intercellular messengers in animals. Proteins also
play many regulatory roles within the cell, turning on
and shutting off genes during development, for exam-
ple. In addition, proteins also receive information, act-
ing as cell surface receptors.

sin. Contractile proteins also play key roles in the Proteins carry out a diverse array of functions, including
cell’s cytoskeleton and in moving materials within catalysis, defense, transport of substances, motion, and
