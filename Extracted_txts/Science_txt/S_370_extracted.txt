The ras gene product is involved in the cellular response
to a variety of growth factors such as EGF, an intercellular
signal that normally initiates cell proliferation. When EGF
binds to a specific receptor protein on the plasma mem-
brane of epithelial cells, the portion of the receptor that
protrudes into the cytoplasm stimulates the ras protein to
bind to GTP. The ras protein/GTP complex in turn re-

cruits and activates a protein called Raf to the inner surface
of the plasma membrane, which in turn activates cytoplas-
mic kinases and so triggers an intracellular signaling system
(see chapter 7). The final step in the pathway is the activa-
tion of transcription factors that trigger cell proliferation.
Cancer-causing mutations in ras greatly reduce the amount
of EGF necessary to initiate cell proliferation.
