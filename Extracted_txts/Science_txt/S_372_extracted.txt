The progression of mutations that commonly lead to colorectal cancer. The fatal metastasis is the last of six serial changes that the
epithelial cells lining the rectum undergo. One of these changes is brought about by mutation of a proto-oncogene, and three of them
involve mutations that inactivate tumor-suppressor genes.

 

Cancer-Causing Mutations Accumulate over

 

Time 500

Cells control proliferation at several checkpoints, and all 450 4
of these controls must be inactivated for cancer to be ini- 4
tiated. Therefore, the induction of most cancers involves 400 +
the mutation of multiple genes; four is a typical number 4
(figure 18.16). In many of the tissue culture cell lines used 360 4

to study cancer, most of the controls are already inacti- |
vated, so that mutations in only one or a few genes trans-
form the line into cancerous growth. The need to inacti-
vate several regulatory genes almost certainly explains
why most cancers occur in people over 40 years old (fig-
ure 18.17); in older persons, there has been more time for
individual cells to accumulate multiple mutations. It is

Cancer is a disease in which the controls that normally
