This process has been clearly demonstrated for
benzo[a]pyrene (BP), one of the potent mutagens released
into cigarette smoke from tars in the tobacco. The epithe-
lial cells of the lung absorb BP from tobacco smoke and
chemically alter it to a derivative form. This derivative
form, benzo[a]pyrene-diolepoxide (BPDE), binds directly
to the tumor-suppressor gene p53 and mutates it to an in-
active form. The protein encoded by p53 oversees the Gy;
cell cycle checkpoint described in chapter 11 and is one of
the body’s key mechanisms for preventing uncontrolled cell
proliferation. The destruction of p53 in lung epithelial cells
greatly hastens the onset of lung cancer—p53 is mutated to
an inactive form in over 70% of lung cancers. When exam-
ined, the p53 mutations in cancer cells almost all occur at
one of three “hot spots.” The key evidence linking smoking
and cancer is that when the mutations of p53 caused by
BPDE from cigarettes are examined, they occur at the
same three specific “hot spots!”

The Incidence of Cancer Reflects Smoking

Cigarette manufacturers argue that the causal connection
between smoking and cancer has not been proved, and
that somehow the relationship is coincidental. Look care-
fully at the data presented in figure 18.21 and see if you
agree. The upper graph, compiled from data on American
men, shows the incidence of smoking from 1900 to 1990
and the incidence of lung cancer over the same period.
Note that as late as 1920, lung cancer was a rare disease.
About 20 years after the incidence of smoking began to
increase among men, lung cancer also started to become
more common.

Now look at the lower graph, which presents data on
American women. Because of social mores, significant
numbers of American women did not smoke until after
World War II, when many social conventions changed. As
late as 1963, when lung cancer among males was near cur-
rent levels, this disease was still rare in women. In the
United States that year, only 6588 women died of lung can-
cer. But as more women smoked, more developed lung
cancer, again with a lag of about 20 years. American
women today have achieved equality with men in the num-
bers of cigarettes they smoke, and their lung cancer death
rates are today approaching those for men. In 1990, more
than 49,000 women died of lung cancer in the United
States. The current annual rate of deaths from lung cancer
in male and female smokers is 180 per 100,000, or about 2
out of every 1000 smokers each year.

 

 

The easiest way to avoid cancer is to avoid exposure to
mutagens. The single greatest contribution one can
make to a longer life is not to smoke.

Tobacco reduces life expectancy. The world’s longest-running
survey of smoking, begun in 1951 in Britain, revealed that by 1994
the death rate for smokers had climbed to three times the rate for
nonsmokers among men 35 to 69 years of age.
