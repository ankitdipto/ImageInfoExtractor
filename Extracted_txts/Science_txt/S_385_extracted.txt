¢ A mutation is any change in the hereditary message.

¢ Mutations that change one or a few nucleotides are
called point mutations. They may arise as a result of
damage from ionizing or ultraviolet radiation,
chemical mutagens, or errors in pairing during DNA
replication.

1, What are pyrimidine dimers?
How do they form? How are
they repaired? What may
happen if they are not repaired?
2. Explain how slipped
mispairing can cause deletions
and frame-shift mutations.

18.2 Cancer results from mutation of growth-regulating genes.

* Cancer is a disease in which the regulatory controls
that normally restrain cell division are disrupted.

* A variety of environmental factors, including ionizing
radiation, chemical mutagens, and viruses, have been
implicated in causing cancer.

¢ The best way to avoid getting cancer is to avoid
exposure to mutagens, especially those in cigarette
smoke.

18.3 Recombination alters gene location.

3. What is transfection? What
has it revealed about the genetic
basis of cancer?

4. About how many genes can be
mutated to cause cancer? Why
do most cancers require
mutations in multiple genes?

¢ Recombination is the creation of new gene
combinations. It includes changes in the position of
genes or fragments of genes as well as the exchange of
entire chromosomes during meiosis.

* Genes may be transferred between bacteria when
they are included within small circles of DNA called
plasmids.

¢ Transposition is the random movement of genes
within transposons to new locations in the genome. It
is responsible for many naturally occurring
mutations, as the insertion of a transposon into a
gene often inactivates the gene.

* Crossing over involves a physical exchange of genetic
material between homologous chromosomes during
the close pairing that occurs in meiosis. It may
produce chromosomes that have different
combinations of alleles.

18.4 Genomes are continually evolving.

5. What is genetic
recombination? What
mechanisms produce it? Which
of these mechanisms occurs in
prokaryotes, and which occurs in
eukaryotes?

6. What is a plasmid? What is a
transposon? How are plasmids
and transposons similar, and
how are they different?

7. What are mismatched pairs?
How are they corrected? What
effect does this correction have
on the genetic message?

* Satellite sequences are short sequences of nucleotides
repeated millions of times.

¢ Tandem clusters are genes that occur in thousands of
copies grouped together at one or a few sites on a
chromosome. These genes encode products that are
required by the cell in large amounts.

* Multigene families consist of copies of genes
clustered at one site on a chromosome that diverge in
sequence more than the genes in a tandem cluster.

8. What kinds of genes exist in
multigene families? How are
these families thought to have
evolved?

9, What are pseudogenes? How
might they have been involved in
the evolution of single-copy
genes?
