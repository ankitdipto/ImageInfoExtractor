SGEC AE STRUCTURAL DEORE AY The 20 common amino acids. Each amino acid has the
same chemical backbone, but differs in the side, or R, group
CHg it possesses. Six of the amino acids are nonpolar because
| they have —CH) or —CH; in their R groups. Two of the
7 six are bulkier because they contain ring structures, which
CH, SH classifies them also as aromatic. Another six are polar
pen | CH, because they have oxygen or just hydrogen in their R
cH, GH—C—OH CH, | groups; these amino acids, which are uncharged, differ from
Xv! n—boc-on  HN—C—C—OH | one another in how polar they are. Five other amino acids
° eI | ol
| an ie are polar and, because they have a terminal acid or base in
H Ho their R group, are capable of ionizing to a charged form.
Proline Methionine Cysteine ‘The remaining three have special chemical properties that
(Pro) (Met) (Cys) allow them to help form links between protein chains or
kinks in proteins.
