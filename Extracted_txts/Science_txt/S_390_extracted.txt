 

HERMAN THE WONDER BULL

GenPharm, a California biotechnology company, engineered Herman,
a bull that possesses the gene for human lactoferrin (HLF). HLF con-
fers antibacterial and iron transport properties to humans. Many of
Herman's female offspring now produce milk containing HLF, and
GenPharm intends to build a herd of transgenic cows for the large-
scale commercial production of HLF.

   

SUPER SALMON!
Canadian fisheries scientists have inserted recombinant growth hor-
mone genes into developing salmon embryos, creating the first trans-
genic salmon. Not only do these transgenic fish have shortened pro-
duction cycles, they are, on an average, 11 times heavier than
nontransgenic salmon! The implications for the fisheries industry and
for worldwide food production are obvious.

 

WILT-PROOF FLOWERS

Ethylene, the plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, also causes
flowers to wilt. Researchers at Purdue have found the gene that
makes flower petals respond to ethylene by wilting and replaced it
with a gene insensitive to ethylene. The transgenic camations they
produced lasted for 3 weeks after cutting, while normal camations
last only 3 days.

WEEVIL-PROOF
PEAS

Not only has gene tech-
nology afforded agricul-
ture viral and pest con-
trol in the field, it has
also provided a pest
control technique for the
storage bin. A team of
U.S. and Australian sci-
entists have engineered
a gene that is expressed
only in the seed of the
pea plant. The enzyme
inhibitor encoded by this
gene inhibits feeding by
weevils, one of the most
notorious pests affecting
stored crops. The world-
wide ramifications are
significant as up to 40%
of stored grains are lost
to pests.
