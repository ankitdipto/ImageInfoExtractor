19.2 Genetic engineering involves easily understood procedures.

The Four Stages of a Genetic
Engineering Experiment

Like the experiment of Cohen and Boyer, most genetic
engineering experiments consist of four stages: DNA
cleavage, production of recombinant DNA, cloning, and
screening.

Stage 1: DNA Cleavage

A restriction endonuclease is used to cleave the source
DNA into fragments. Because the endonuclease’s recog-
nition sequence is likely to occur many times within the
source DNA, cleavage will produce a large number of
different fragments. A different set of fragments will be

obtained by employing endonucleases that recognize dif-
ferent sequences. The fragments can be separated from
one another according to their size by electrophoresis

(figure 19.4).

Stage 2: Production of Recombinant DNA

The fragments of DNA are inserted into plasmids or viral
vectors, which have been cleaved with the same restriction
endonuclease as the source DNA.

Completed gel

Electric current applied, fragments migrate
down the gel by size—smaller ones move
faster (and therefore go farther) than larger

Gel electrophoresis. («) After restriction endonucleases have cleaved the DNA, the fragments are loaded on a gel, and an electric current
is applied. The DNA fragments migrate through the gel, with bigger ones moving more slowly. The fragments can be visualized easily, as
the migrating bands fluoresce in UV light when stained with ethidium bromide. (J) In the photograph, one band of DNA has been excised
from the gel for further analysis and can be seen glowing in the tube the technician holds.
