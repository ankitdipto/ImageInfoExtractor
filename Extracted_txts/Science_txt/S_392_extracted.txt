Stages in a genetic engineering experiment. In stage 1, DNA containing the gene of interest (in this case, from an animal cell) and

DNA from a plasmid are cleaved with the same restriction endonuclease. The genes amp* and /acZ' are contained within the plasmid and
used for screening a clone (stage 4). In stage 2, the two cleaved sources of DNA are mixed together and pair at their sticky ends. In stage 3,
the recombinant DNA is inserted into a bacterial cell, which reproduces and forms clones. In stage 4, the bacterial clones will be screened
for the gene of interest.
