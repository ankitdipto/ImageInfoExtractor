Sequencing DNA: The Sanger Method

Most DNA sequencing is currently done using the “chain
termination” technique developed initially by Frederick
Sanger, for which he earned his second Nobel Prize (figure
19.12). (1) A short single-stranded primer is added to the
end of a single-stranded DNA fragment of unknown se-
quence. The primer provides a 3” end for DNA poly-
merase. (2) The primed fragment is added, along with
DNA polymerase and a supply of all four deoxynucleotides
(d-nucleotides), to four synthesis tubes. Each contains a
different dideoxynucleotide (dd-nucleotide); such nu-
cleotides lack both the 2’ and the 3° —OH groups and are
thus chain-terminating. The first tube, for example, con-
tains ddATP and stops synthesis whenever ddA is incorpo-
rated into DNA instead of dATP. Because of the relatively
low concentration of ddATP compared to dATP, ddA will

not necessarily be added to the first A site; this tube will
contain a series of fragments of different lengths, corre-
sponding to the different distances the polymerase traveled
from the primer before a ddA was incorporated. (3) These
fragments can be separated according to size by elec-
trophoresis. (4) A radioactive label (here dATP*) allows
the fragments to be visualized on X-ray film, and the
newly made sequence can be read directly from the film.
Try it. (5) The original fragment has the complementary
sequence.

 

Techniques such as Southern blotting and PCR enable
investigators to identify specific genes and produce
them in large quantities, while RFLP analysis and the
Sanger method identify individuals and unknown gene
sequences.
