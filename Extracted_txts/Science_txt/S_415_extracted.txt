* Genetic engineering involves the isolation of specific
genes and their transfer to new genomes.

¢ An important component of genetic engineering
technology is a special class of enzymes called
restriction endonucleases, which cleave DNA
molecules into fragments.

* The first such recombinant DNA was made by

Cohen and Boyer in 1973, when they inserted a frog
ribosomal RNA gene into a bacterial plasmid.

1. Why do the ends of the DNA
fragments created by restriction
endonucleases enable fragments
from different genomes to be
spliced together?

19.2 Genetic engineering involves easily understood procedures.

* Genetic engineering experiments consist of four
stages: isolation of DNA, production of recombinant
DNA, cloning, and screening for the gene(s) of
interest.

* Preliminary screening can be accomplished by
making the desired clones resistant to an antibiotic;
hybridization can then be employed to identify the
gene of interest.

* Gene technologies, including PCR, Southern
blotting, RFLP analysis, and the Sanger method,
enable researchers to isolate genes and produce them
in large quantities.

19.3 Biotechnology is producing a scientific revolution.

2. Describe the procedure used
to eliminate clones that have not
incorporated a vector in a
genetic engineering experiment.

3. What is used as a probe in a
Southern blot? With what does
the probe hybridize? How are
the regions of hybridization
visualized?

* Polymerase Chain
Reaction

* Recombinant

¢ Extensive research on the human genome has yielded
important information about the location of genes,
such as those that may be involved in dyslexia,
obesity, and resistance to high blood cholesterol
levels.

* Gene splicing holds great promise as a clinical tool,
particularly in the prevention of disease with
bioengineered vaccines.

¢ A major focus of genetic engineering activity has been
agriculture, where genes conferring resistance to
herbicides or insect pests have been incorporated into
crop plants.

 

¢ Recent experiments open the way for cloning of
genetically altered animals and suggest that human
cloning is feasible.

¢ The impact of genetic engineering has skyrocketed
over the past decade, providing many useful
innovations for society; its moral and ethical aspects
still provide a topic for heated debates.

4, What is the primary vector
used to introduce genes into
plant cells? What types of plants
are generally infected by this
vector? Describe three examples
of how this vector has been used
for genetic engineering, and
explain the agricultural
significance of each example.

5. How is the genetic
engineering of bovine
somatotropin (BST) used to
increase milk production in the
dairy industry? What effect
would BST in milk have on
persons who drink it?
