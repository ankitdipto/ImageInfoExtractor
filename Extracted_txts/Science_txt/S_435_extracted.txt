20.1 Genes vary in natural populations.

 

¢ Evolution is best defined as “descent with
modification.”

¢ Darwin’s primary insight was to propose that
evolutionary change resulted from the operation of
natural selection.

¢ By the 1860s, natural selection was widely accepted as
the correct explanation for the process of evolution.
The field of evolution did not progress much further,
however, until the 1920s because of the lack of a
suitable explanation of how hereditary traits are
transmitted.

¢ Invertebrates and outcrossing plants are often
heterozygous at about 12 to 15% of their loci; the
corresponding value for vertebrates is about 4 to 8%.

20.2 Why do allele frequencies change in populations?

1. What is the difference
between natural selection and
evolution?

2. What is adaptation? How
does it fit into Darwin’s concept
of evolution?

3. What is genetic
polymorphism? What has
polymorphism to do with
evolution?

* Studies of how allele frequencies shift within
populations allow investigators to study evolution in
action.

© Meiosis does not alter allele frequencies within
populations. Unless selection or some other force acts
on the genes, the frequencies of their alleles remain
unchanged from one generation to the next.

¢ A variety of processes can lead to evolutionary change
within a population, including genetic drift,
inbreeding, gene flow, and natural selection.

¢ For evolution to occur by natural selection, three
conditions must be met: 1. variation must exist in the
population; 2. the variation must have a genetic basis;
and 3. variation must be related to the number of
offspring left in the next generation.

¢ Natural selection can usually overpower the effects of
genetic drift, except in very small populations.

¢ Natural selection can overwhelm the effects of gene
flow in some cases, but not in others.

20.3 Selection can act on traits affected by many genes.

4. Given that allele A is present
in a large random-mating
population at a frequency of 54
per 100 individuals, what is the
proportion of individuals in that
population expected to be
heterozygous for the allele?
homozygous dominant?
homozygous recessive?

5. Why does the founder effect
have such a profound influence
on a population’s genetic
makeup? How does the
bottleneck effect differ from the
founder effect?

6. What effect does inbreeding
have on allele frequency? Why is
marriage between close relatives
discouraged?

¢ Directional selection acts to eliminate one extreme
from an array of phenotypes; stabilizing selection acts
to eliminate both extremes; and disruptive selection
acts to eliminate rather than to favor the intermediate
type.

¢ Natural selection is not all powerful; genetic variation
is required for natural selection to produce
evolutionary change.

7. Define selection. How does it
alter allele frequencies? What
are the three types of selection?
Give an example of each.

8. Why are there limitations to
the success of selection?
