Gaps in the Fossil Record

This is not to say that the fossil
record is complete. Given the low
likelihood of fossil preservation and
recovery, it is not surprising that
there are gaps in the fossil record.
Nonetheless, paleontologists (the
scientists who study fossils) continue
to fill in the gaps in the fossil record.
While many gaps interrupted the
fossil record in Darwin’s era, even
then, scientists knew of the Ar-
chaeopteryx fossil transitional between
dinosaurs and birds. Today, the fos-
sil record is far more complete, par-
ticularly among the vertebrates; fos-
sils have been found linking all the
major groups. Recent years have
seen spectacular discoveries closing
some of the major remaining gaps in
our understanding of vertebrate evo-
lution. For example, recently a four-
legged aquatic mammal was discov-
ered that provides important insights
concerning the evolution of whales
and dolphins from land-living,
hoofed ancestors (figure 21.3). Simi-
larly, a fossil snake with legs has shed
light on the evolution of snakes,
which are descended from lizards
that gradually became more and
more elongated with simultaneous
reduction and eventual disappear-
ance of the limbs.

On a finer scale, evolutionary
change within some types of animals
is known in exceptional detail. For
example, about 200 million years
ago, oysters underwent a change
from small curved shells to larger,
flatter ones, with progressively flat-
ter fossils being seen in the fossil
record over a period of 12 million
years (figure 21.4). A host of other
examples all illustrate a record of
successive change. The demonstra-
tion of this successive change is one
of the strongest lines of evidence
that evolution has occurred.

The fossil record provides a clear
record of the major evolutionary
transitions that have occurred
through time.

in the gaps between the mesonychids, the hypothetical ancestral link between the
whales and the hoofed mammals, and present-day whales.

Evolution of shell shape in oysters. Over 12 million years of the Early Jurassic
Period, the shells of this group of coiled oysters became larger, thinner, and flatter.
These animals rested on the ocean floor in a special position called the “life
position,” and it may be that the larger, flatter shells were more stable in disruptive

water movements.
