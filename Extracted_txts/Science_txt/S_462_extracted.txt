Dewlaps of several different species of Caribbean Anolis lizards. Males use their dewlaps in both territorial and courtship displays.
Coexisting species almost always differ in their dewlaps, which are used in species recognition. Some dewlaps are easier to see in open
habitats, whereas others are more visible in shaded environments.
