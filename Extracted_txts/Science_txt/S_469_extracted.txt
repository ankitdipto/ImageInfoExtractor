Diversity of Life through Time

Although eukaryotes evolved nearly 3 billion years ago, the
diversity of life didn’t increase substantially until approxi-
mately 550 million years ago. Then, almost all of the extant
types of animals evolved in a geologically short period
termed the “Cambrian explosion.” In addition to organisms
whose descendants are recognizable today, a wide variety of

Diversity of animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion. In addition to the appearance of the ancestors of many present-day
groups, such as insects and vertebrates, a variety of bizarre creatures evolved that left no descendants, such as Wiwaxia, Marrella, Opabinia,
and the aptly named Hallucigenia. The natural history of these species is open to speculation. Key: (1) Amiskwia, (2) Odontogriphus, (3)
Eldonia, (4) Halichondrites, (5) Anomalocaris canadensis, (6) Pikaia, (7) Canadia, (8) Marrella splendens, (9) Opabinia, (10) Ottoia, (11) Wiwaxia,
(12) Yoboia, (13) Xianguangia, (14) Aysheaia, (15) Sidneyia, (16) Dinomischus, (17) Hallucigenia.

other types of organisms also evolved (figure 22.16). The
biology of these creatures, which quickly disappeared with-
out leaving any descendants, is poorly understood. The
Cambrian explosion seems to have been a time of evolu-
tionary experimentation and innovation, in which many
types of organisms appeared, but most were quickly weeded
out. What prompted this explosion of diversity is still a
subject of considerable controversy.
