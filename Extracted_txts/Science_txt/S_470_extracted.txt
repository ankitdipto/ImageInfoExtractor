FIGURE 22.17

Diversity through time. Taxonomic diversity of families of marine animals since the Cambrian Period. The fossil record is most
complete for marine organisms because they are more readily fossilized than terrestrial species. Families are shown, rather than species,
because many species are known from only one specimen, thus introducing error into estimates of time of extinction.

Trends in Species Diversity

The number of species in the world has increased vastly
since the Cambrian. However, the trend has been far from
consistent (figure 22.17). After a rapid rise, the number of
species reached a plateau for about 200 million years ago;
since then, the number has risen steadily.

Interspersed in these patterns, however, have been a
number of major setbacks, termed mass extinctions, in
which the number of species has greatly decreased. Five
major mass extinctions have been identified, the most se-
vere of which occurred at the end of the Permian Period,
approximately 225 million years ago, at which time more
than half of all families and as many as 96% of all species
may have perished.

The most famous and well-studied extinction, though
not as drastic, occurred at the end of the Cretaceous Period
(63 million years ago), at which time the dinosaurs and a
variety of other organisms went extinct. Recent studies
have provided support for the hypothesis that this extinc-
tion event was triggered by a large asteroid which slammed
into the earth, perhaps causing global forest fires and ob-
scuring the sun for months by throwing particles into the
air. This mass extinction did have one positive effect,
though: with the disappearance of dinosaurs, mammals,

which previously had been small and inconspicuous,
quickly experienced a vast evolutionary radiation, which ul-
timately produced a wide variety of organisms, including
elephants, tigers, whales, and humans. Indeed, a general
observation is that biological diversity tends to rebound
quickly after mass extinctions, reaching comparable levels
of species richness, even if the organisms making up that
diversity are not the same.

A Sixth Extinction

The number of species in the world in recent times is
greater than it has ever been. Unfortunately, that number
is decreasing at an alarming rate due to human activities.
Some estimate that as many as one-fourth of all species
will become extinct in the next 50 years, a rate of
extinction not seen on earth since the Cretaceous mass
extinction.

 

The number of species has increased through time,
although not at constant rates. Several major extinction
events have substantially, though briefly, reduced the
number of species.
