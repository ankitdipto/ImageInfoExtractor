* Species are groups of organisms that differ from one
another in one or more characteristics and do not
hybridize freely when they come into contact in their
natural environment. Many species cannot hybridize
with one another at all.

* Species exhibit geographic variation, yet
phenotypically distinctive populations are connected
by intermediate forms.

1. Define the term sympatry.

Why is sympatric speciation
thought by many to be unlikely?

2. What is the biological

species concept?

22.2 Species maintain their genetic distinctiveness through barriers to reproduction.

 

¢ Among the factors that separate populations and
species are geographical, ecological, temporal,
behavioral, and mechanical isolation, as well as factors
that inhibit the fusion of gametes or the normal
development of the hybrid organisms.

*¢ Some isolating mechanisms (prezygotic) prevent
hybrid formation; others (postzygotic) prevent
hybrids from surviving and reproducing.

3. What is the difference
between prezygotic and
postzygotic isolating
mechanisms?

4, What barriers exist to hybrid
formation and success? Which
are prezygotic and which are
postzygotic isolating
mechanisms? Why do some
people think the term “isolating
mechanism” is misleading?

22.3 We have learned a great deal about how species form.

¢ Reproductive isolation can arise as populations
differentiate by adaptation to different environments,
as well as by random genetic drift, founder effects, or
population bottlenecks.

¢ Natural selection may favor changes in the mating
system when a species occupies a new habitat, so that
the species becomes reproductively isolated from
other species.

© When two species are not completely reproductively
isolated, natural selection may favor the evolution of
more effective isolating mechanisms to prevent
hybridization, a process termed “reinforcement.”

22.4 Clusters of species reflect rapid evolution.

5. How does selection relate to
population divergence?

6. How many genes are
involved in the speciation
process?

7. When are hybrids ata
disadvantage? What can be the
result of this disadvantage?

8. Define the term polyploidy.

Evolution in Ferns

 

© Clusters of species arise when populations
differentiate to fill several niches. On islands,
differentiation is often rapid because of numerous
open habitats.

¢ The pace of evolution is not constant among all

organisms. Some scientists believe it occurs in spurts,
others argue that it proceeds gradually.

¢ Hybridization occurs commonly among plants and
even among animals. The biological species concept
may not apply to all organisms.

9, What is adaptive radiation?
What types of habitats
encourage it? Why?

10. What is the difference
between gradualism and
punctuated equilibrium?

11. Why is the biological species
concept no longer considered to
be universally applicable?
