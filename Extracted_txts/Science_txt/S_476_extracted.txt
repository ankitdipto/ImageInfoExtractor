FIGURE 23.3

A primate evolutionary tree. The most ancient of the primates are the prosimians, while the hominids were the most recent to evolve.

Old World Monkeys. Around 25
million years ago, anthropoids that
remained in Africa split into two lin-
cages: one gave rise to the Old
World monkeys and one gave rise to
the hominoids (see page 480). Old
World monkeys include ground-
dwelling as well as arboreal species.
None of the Old World monkeys
have prehensile tails. Their nostrils
are close together, their noses point
downward, and some have toughened
pads of skin for prolonged sitting
(figure 23.40).

The earliest primates arose from
small, tree-dwelling, insect-eaters
and gave rise to prosimians and
then anthropoids. Early
anthropoids gave rise to New
World monkeys and Old World
monkeys.

New and Old World monkeys. (a) New World monkeys, such as this golden lion tamarin,
are arboreal, and many have prehensile tails. (b) Old World monkeys lack prehensile tails,

and many are ground dwellers.
