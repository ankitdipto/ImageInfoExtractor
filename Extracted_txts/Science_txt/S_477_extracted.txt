How the Apes Evolved

The other African anthropoid lineage is the hominoids,
which includes the apes and the hominids (humans and
their direct ancestors). The living apes consist of the gib-
bon (genus Hylobates), orangutan (Pongo), gorilla (Gorilla),
and chimpanzee (Pan) (figure 23.5). Apes have larger
brains than monkeys, and they lack tails. With the excep-
tion of the gibbon, which is small, all living apes are larger
than any monkey. Apes exhibit the most adaptable behav-
ior of any mammal except human beings. Once wide-
spread in Africa and Asia, apes are rare today, living in
relatively small areas. No apes ever occurred in North or
South America.

The First Hominoid

Considerable controversy exists about the identity of the
first hominoid. During the 1980s it was commonly believed
that the common ancestor of apes and hominids was a late
Miocene ape living 5 to 10 million years ago. In 1932, a
candidate fossil, an 8-million-year-old jaw with teeth, was
unearthed in India. It was called Ramapithecus (after the
Hindi deity Rama). However, these fossils have never been
found in Africa, and more complete fossils discovered in
1981 made it clear that Ramapithecus is in fact closely re-
lated to the orangutan. Attention has now shifted to an
earlier Miocene ape, Proconsul, which has many of the char-
acteristics of Old World monkeys but lacks a tail and has
apelike hands, feet, and pelvis. However, because very few
fossils have been recovered from the period 5 to 10 million
years ago, it is not yet possible to identify with certainty the
first hominoid ancestor.
