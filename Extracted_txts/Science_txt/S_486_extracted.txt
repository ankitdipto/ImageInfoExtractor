A clearer analysis is possible using chro-
mosomal DNA, segments of which are far
more variable than mitochondrial DNA,
providing more “markers” to compare.
When a variable segment of DNA from
human chromosome 12 was analyzed in
1996, a clear picture emerged. A total of 24
different versions of this segment were
found. Fully 21 of them were present in
human populations in Africa, while three
were found in Europeans and only two in
Asians and in Americans. This result argues
strongly that chromosome 12 has existed in
Africa far longer than among non-African
humans, strongly supporting an African ori-
gin of H. sapiens. Recently discovered fossils
of early H. sapiens from Africa also lend
strong support to this hypothesis.

Homo sapiens, our species, seems to have
evolved in Africa and then, like H. erectus
before it, migrated to Europe and Asia.

Out of Africa—many times. A still-controversial theory suggests that Homo
spread from Africa to Europe and Asia repeatedly. First, Homo erectus (white
arrow) spread as far as Java and China. Later, H. erectus was followed and
replaced by Homo neanderthalensis, a pattern repeated again still later by Homo
sapiens (red arrow).
