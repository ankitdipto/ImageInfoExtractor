Age Structure

In most species, the probability that an individual will re-
produce or die varies through its life span. A group of indi-
viduals of the same age is referred to as a cohort. Within a
population, every cohort has a characteristic birthrate, or
fecundity, defined as the number of offspring produced in
a standard time (for example, per year), and a characteristic
death rate, or mortality, the number of individuals that die
in that period.

The relative number of individuals in each cohort de-
fines a population’s age structure. Because individuals of
different ages have different fecundity and death rates,
age structure has a critical impact on a population’s
growth rate. Populations with a large proportion of
young individuals, for example, tend to grow rapidly be-
cause an increasing proportion of their individuals are re-
productive. Populations in many underdeveloped coun-
tries are an example, as we will discuss later in the
chapter. Conversely, if a large proportion of a population
is relatively old, populations may decline. This phenome-
non now characterizes some wealthy countries in Europe
and Japan.

Life Tables and Population Change
through Time

Ecologists use life tables to assess how populations in na-
ture are changing. Life tables can be constructed by follow-
ing the fate of a cohort from birth until death, noting the
number of offspring produced and individuals that die each
year. A very nice example of a life table analysis is exhibited
in a study of the meadow grass Poa annua. This study fol-
lows the fate of 843 individuals through time, charting how
many survive in each interval and how many offspring each
survivor produces (table 24.1).

In table 24.1, the first column indicates the age of the
cohort (that is, the number of 3-month intervals from the
start of the study). The second and third columns indicate
the number of survivors and the proportion of the original
cohort still alive at the beginning of that interval. The
fourth column presents the mortality rate, the proportion
of individuals that started that interval alive but died by the
end of it. The fifth column indicates the average number of
seeds produced by each surviving individual in that interval,
and the last column presents the number of seeds produced
relative to the size of the original cohort.
