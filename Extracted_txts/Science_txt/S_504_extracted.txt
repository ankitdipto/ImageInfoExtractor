Carrying Capacity

No matter how rapidly populations grow, they eventually
reach a limit imposed by shortages of important environ-
mental factors, such as space, light, water, or nutrients. A
population ultimately may stabilize at a certain size, called
the carrying capacity of the particular place where it lives.
The carrying capacity, symbolized by K, is the maximum
number of individuals that a population can support.

The Logistic Growth Model

As a population approaches its carrying capacity, its rate of
growth slows greatly, because fewer resources remain for
each new individual to use. The growth curve of such a
population, which is always limited by one or more factors
in the environment, can be approximated by the following
logistic growth equation:

dN [K-N'

In this logistic model of population growth, the growth
rate of the population (dN/dt) equals its rate of increase (r
multiplied by N, the number of individuals present at any
one time), adjusted for the amount of resources available.
The adjustment is made by multiplying rN by the fraction
of K still unused (K minus N, divided by K). As N in-
creases (the population grows in size), the fraction by
which r is multiplied (the remaining resources) becomes
smaller and smaller, and the rate of increase of the popu-
lation declines.

In mathematical terms, as N approaches K, the rate of
population growth (dN/dt) begins to slow, reaching 0 when
N= K (blue line in figure 24.18). Graphically, if you plot N
versus t (time) you obtain an S-shaped sigmoid growth
curve characteristic of many biological populations. The
curve is called “sigmoid” because its shape has a double
curve like the letter S. As the size of a population stabilizes
at the carrying capacity, its rate of growth slows down,
eventually coming to a halt (figure 24.172).

In many cases, real populations display trends corre-
sponding to a logistic growth curve. This is true not only in
the laboratory, but also in natural populations (figure
24.17b). In some cases, however, the fit is not perfect (fig-
ure 24.17c) and, as we shall see shortly, many populations
exhibit other patterns.

 

The size at which a population stabilizes in a particular
place is defined as the carrying capacity of that place for
that species. Populations often grow to the carrying
capacity of their environment.
