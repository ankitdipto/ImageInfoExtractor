Population Pyramids

While the human population as a whole continues to grow
rapidly at the close of the twentieth century, this growth is
not occurring uniformly over the planet. Some countries,
like Mexico, are growing rapidly, their birthrate greatly ex-
ceeding their death rate (figure 24.23). Other countries are
growing much more slowly. The rate at which a population
can be expected to grow in the future can be assessed
graphically by means of a population pyramid—a bar
graph displaying the numbers of people in each age cate-
gory. Males are conventionally shown to the left of the ver-
tical age axis, females to the right. A human population
pyramid thus displays the age composition of a population
by sex. In most human population pyramids, the number of
older females is disproportionately large compared to the
number of older males, because females in most regions
have a longer life expectancy than males.

Viewing such a pyramid, one can predict demographic
trends in births and deaths. In general, rectangular
“pyramids” are characteristic of countries whose popula-
tions are stable, their numbers neither growing nor
shrinking. A triangular pyramid is characteristic of a
country that will exhibit rapid future growth, as most of
its population has not yet entered the child-bearing
years. Inverted triangles are characteristic of populations
that are shrinking.

Examples of population pyramids for the United States
and Kenya in 1990 are shown in figure 24.24. In the nearly
rectangular population pyramid for the United States, the
cohort (group of individuals) 55 to 59 years old represents
people born during the Depression and is smaller in size

Why the population of Mexico is growing. The death rate (red
Jine) in Mexico fell steadily throughout the last century, while the
birthrate (b/uve /ine) remained fairly steady until 1970. The
difference between birth and death rates has fueled a high growth
rate. Efforts begun in 1970 to reduce the birthrate have been
quite successful, although the growth rate remains rapid.

than the cohorts in the preceding and following years. The
cohorts 25 to 44 years old represent the “baby boom.” The
rectangular shape of the population pyramid indicates that
the population of the United States is not expanding
rapidly. The very triangular pyramid of Kenya, by contrast,
predicts explosive future growth. The population of Kenya
is predicted to double in less than 20 years.

FIGURE 24.24

Population pyramids from 1990. Population pyramids are graphed according to a population’s age distribution. Kenya’s pyramid has a
broad base because of the great number of individuals below child-bearing age. When all of the young people begin to bear children, the
population will experience rapid growth. The U.S. pyramid demonstrates a larger number of individuals in the “baby boom” cohort—the

pyramid bulges because of an increase in births between 1945 and 1964.
