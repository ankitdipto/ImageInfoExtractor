An Uncertain Future

The earth’s rapidly growing human population constitutes
perhaps the greatest challenge to the future of the bio-
sphere, the world’s interacting community of living things.
Humanity is adding 77 million people a year to the earth's
population—a million every five days, 150 every minute! In
more rapidly growing countries, the resulting population
increase is staggering (table 24.3). India, for example, had a
population of 853 million in 1996; by 2020 its population
will exceed 1.4 billion!

A key element in the world’s population growth is its
uneven distribution among countries. Of the billion people
added to the world’s population in the 1990s, 90% live in
developing countries (figure 24.25). This is leading to a
major reduction in the fraction of the world’s population
that lives in industrialized countries. In 1950, fully one-
third of the world’s population lived in industrialized coun-
tries; by 1996 that proportion had fallen to one-quarter; in
2020 the proportion will have fallen to one-sixth. Thus the
world’s population growth will be centered in the parts of
the world least equipped to deal with the pressures of rapid
growth.

Rapid population growth in developing countries has
the harsh consequence of increasing the gap between rich
and poor. Today 23% of the world’s population lives in
the industrialized world with a per capita income of
$17,900, while 77% of the world’s population lives in de-
veloping countries with a per capita income of only $810.
The disproportionate wealth of the industrialized quarter
of the world’s population is evidenced by the fact that
85% of the world’s capital wealth is in the industrial
world, only 15% in developing countries. Eighty percent
of all the energy used today is consumed by the industrial
world, only 20% by developing countries. Perhaps most
worrisome for the future, fully 94% of all scientists and
engineers reside in the industrialized world, only 6% in
developing countries. Thus the problems created by the
future’s explosive population growth will be faced by
countries with little of the world’s scientific or technolog-
ical expertise.

No one knows whether the world can sustain today’s
population of 6 billion people, much less the far greater
populations expected in the future. As chapter 30 out-
lines, the world ecosystem is already under considerable

Most of the worldwide increase in population since 1950 has
occurred in developing countries. The age structures of
developing countries indicate that this trend will increase in the
near future. The stabilizing of the world’s population at about 10
billion (shown here) is an optimistic World Bank/United Nations
prediction that assumes significant worldwide reductions in
growth rate. If the world’s population continues to increase at its
1996 rate, there will be over 30 billion humans by 2100!

stress. We cannot reasonably expect to continue to ex-
pand its carrying capacity indefinitely, and indeed we al-
ready seem to be stretching the limits. It seems unavoid-
able that to restrain the world’s future population
growth, birth and death rates must be equalized. If we are
to avoid catastrophic increases in the death rate, the
birthrates must fall dramatically. Faced with this grim di-
chotomy, significant efforts are underway worldwide to
lower birthrates.

 

The human population has been growing rapidly for
300 years, since technological innovations dramatically
reduced the death rate.
