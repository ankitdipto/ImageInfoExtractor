24.1 Populations are individuals of the same species that live together.

¢ Populations are the same species in one place;
communities are populations of different species that
live together in a particular place. A community and
the nonliving components of its environment

combine to form an ecosystem.

* Populations may be dispersed in a clumped, uniform,

or random manner.

1. What are the three types of

dispersion in a population?
Which type is most frequently
seen in nature? Why?

2. What are some causes of

clumped distributions?

24.2 Population dynamics depend critically upon age distribution.

¢ The growth rate of a population depends on its age
structure, and to a lesser degree, sex ratio.

¢ Survivorship curves describe the characteristics of
mortality in different kinds of populations.

3. What is survivorship?
Describe the three types of
survivorship curves and give
examples of each.

4, What is demography? How
does a life table work?

24.3 Life histories often reflect trade-offs between reproduction and survival.

¢ Organisms balance investment in current
reproduction with investment in growth and future

reproduction.

24.4 Population growth is limited by the environment.

5. Why do some birds lay fewer
than the optimal number of
eggs as predicted by David
Lack?

¢ Population size will change if birth and death rates
differ, or if there is net migration into or out of the
population. The intrinsic rate of increase of a
population is defined as its biotic potential.

¢ Many populations exhibit a sigmoid growth curve,
with a relatively slow start in growth, a rapid increase,
and then a leveling off when the carrying capacity of

the environment is reached.

¢ Large broods and rapid rates of population growth
characterize r-strategists. K-strategists are limited in
population size by the carrying capacity of their
environments; they tend to have fewer offspring and
slower rates of population growth.

¢ Density-independent factors have the same impact on
a population no matter what its density.

6. Define the biotic potential of
a population. What is the
definition for the actual rate of
population increase? What other
two factors affect it?

7. What is an exponential
capacity for growth? When does
this type of growth naturally
occur? Give an example.

8. What is carrying capacity? Is
this a static or dynamic measure?
Why?

9, What is the difference
between r- and K-selected
populations?

24.5 The human population has grown explosively in the last three centuries.
