¢ Each species plays a specific role in its ecosystem; this
role is called its niche.

¢ An organism’s fundamental niche is the total niche
that the organism would occupy in the absence of
competition. Its realized niche is the actual niche it
occupies in nature.

¢ Two species cannot occupy the same niche for long if
resources are limiting; one will outcompete the other,
driving it to extinction.

* Species can coexist by partitioning resources to mini-
mize competition.

25.2 Predators and their prey coevolve.

1. What is the difference
between interspecific
competition and intraspecific
competition? What is Gause’s
principle of competitive
exclusion?

2. Is the term niche synonymous
with the term habitat? Why or
why not? How does an
organism’s fundamental niche
differ from its realized niche?

¢ Plants are often protected from herbivores by
chemicals they manufacture.

¢ Warning, or aposematic, coloration is characteristic
of organisms that are poisonous, sting, or are
otherwise harmful. In contrast, cryptic coloration, or
camouflage, is characteristic of nonpoisonous
organisms.

¢ Predator-prey relationships are of crucial importance
in limiting population sizes in nature.

25.3 Evolution sometimes fosters cooperation.

3. What morphological defenses
do plants use to defend
themselves against herbivores?

4. Consider aposematic
coloration, cryptic coloration,
and Batesian mimicry. Which
would be associated with an
adult viceroy butterfly? Which
would be associated with a larval
monarch butterfly? Which

would be associated with a larval
viceroy butterfly?

 

* Coevolution occurs when different kinds of
organisms evolve adjustments to one another over
long periods of time.

¢ Many organisms have coevolved to a point of
dependence. In mutualism the relationship is
mutually beneficial; in commensalism, only one
organism benefits while the other is unharmed; and
in parasitism one organism serves as a host to
another, usually to the host’s disadvantage.

5. Why is eliminating predators
a bad idea for species richness?

6. How can predation and
competition interact in
regulating species diversity of a
community?

25.4 Ecological succession may increase species richness.

* Primary succession takes place in barren areas, like
rocks or open water. Secondary succession takes place
in areas where the original communities of organisms
have been disturbed.

* Succession occurs because of tolerance, facilitation,
and inhibition.
¢ Disturbance can disrupt successional changes. In

some cases, disturbance can increase species richness
of a community.

7. Why have scientists altered
the concept of a final, climax
vegetation in a given ecosystem?
What types of organisms are
often associated with early stages
of succession? What is the role
of disturbance in succession?
