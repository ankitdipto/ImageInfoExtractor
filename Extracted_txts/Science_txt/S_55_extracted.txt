¢ The chemistry of living systems is the chemistry of
carbon-containing compounds.

* Carbon’s unique chemical properties allow it to poly-
merize into chains by dehydration synthesis, forming
the four key biological macromolecules: carbohy-
drates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

3.2 Proteins perform the chemistry of the cell.

1, What types of molecules are
formed by dehydration reac-
tions? What types of molecules
are formed by hydrolysis?

* Proteins are polymers of amino acids.

* Because the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins
have side groups with different chemical properties,
the function and shape of a protein are critically af-
fected by its particular sequence of amino acids.

2. How are amino acids linked to
form proteins?
3. Explain what is meant by the

primary, secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary structure of a protein.

3.3 Nucleic acids store and transfer genetic information.

¢ Hereditary information is stored as a sequence of nu-
cleotides in a linear polymer called DNA, which ex-
ists in cells as a double helix.

* Cells use the information in DNA by producing a
complementary single strand of RNA which directs
the synthesis of a protein whose amino acid sequence
corresponds to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA
from which the RNA was transcribed.

3.4 Lipids make membranes and store energy.

4, Whatare the three compo-
nents of a nucleotide? How are
nucleotides linked to form nucle-
ic acids?

5. Which of the purines and py-
rimidines are capable of forming
base-pairs with each other?

 

¢ Fats are one type of water-insoluble molecules called
lipids.

¢ Fats are molecules that contain many energy-rich
C—H bonds and, thus, provide an efficient form of
long-term energy storage.

* Types of lipids include phospholipids, fats, terpenes,
steroids, and prostaglandins.

6. What are the two kinds of
subunits that make up a fat mole-
cule, and how are they arranged
in the molecule?

7. Describe the differences be-
tween a saturated and an unsat-
urated fat.

3.5 Carbohydrates store energy and provide building materials.

* Carbohydrates store considerable energy in their

carbon-hydrogen (C—H) bonds.

¢ The most metabolically important carbohydrate is
glucose, a six-carbon sugar.

* Excess energy resources may be stored in complex
sugar polymers called starches (in plants) and glyco-
gen (in animals and fungi).

8. What does it mean to say that
glucose, fructose, and galactose
are isomers? Which two are
structural isomers, and how do
they differ from each other?
Which two are stereoisomers,
and how do they differ from each
other?
