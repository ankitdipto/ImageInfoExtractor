FIGURE 27.11

Hypothetical example of genetic relationship. On average, full siblings will share half of their alleles. By contrast, cousins will, on

average, only share one-eighth of their alleles.

Hamilton showed that by directing aid toward kin, or
close genetic relatives, an altruist may increase the repro-
ductive success of its relatives enough to compensate for
the reduction in its own fitness. Because the altruist’s be-
havior increases the propagation of alleles in relatives, it
will be favored by natural selection. Selection that favors al-
truism directed toward relatives is called kin selection. Al-
though the behaviors being favored are cooperative, the
genes are actually “behaving selfishly,” because they en-
courage the organism to support copies of themselves in
other individuals.

Hamilton’s kin selection model predicts that altruism is
likely to be directed toward close relatives. The more
closely related two individuals are, the greater the poten-

tial genetic payoff. This relationship is described by
Hamilton’s rule, which states that altruistic acts are fa-
vored when b/c > 1/r. In this expression, b and ¢ are the
benefits and costs of the altruistic act, respectively, and r
is the coefficient of relatedness, the proportion of alleles
shared by two individuals through common descent. For
example, an individual should be willing to have one less
child if such actions allow a half-sibling, which shares
one-quarter of its genes, to have more than four addi-
tional offspring.

 

Many factors could be responsible for the evolution of
altruistic behaviors.
