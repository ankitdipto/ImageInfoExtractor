 

Primary Productivity

Approximately 1 to 5% of the solar energy that falls on a
plant is converted to the chemical bonds of organic mate-
rial. Primary production or primary productivity are
terms used to describe the amount of organic matter pro-
duced from solar energy in a given area during a given pe-
riod of time. Gross primary productivity is the total or-
ganic matter produced, including that used by the
photosynthetic organism for respiration. Net primary
productivity (NPP), therefore, is a measure of the
amount of organic matter produced in a community in a
given time that is available for heterotrophs. It equals the
gross primary productivity minus the amount of energy
expended by the metabolic activities of the photosynthetic
organisms. The net weight of all of the organisms living
in an ecosystem, its biomass, increases as a result of its
net production.

Productive Biological Communities

Some ecosystems have a high net primary productivity. For
example, tropical forests and wetlands normally produce
between 1500 and 3000 grams of organic material per
square meter per year. By contrast, corresponding figures
for other communities include 1200 to 1300 grams for
temperate forests, 900 grams for savanna, and 90 grams for
deserts (table 28.1).

Secondary Productivity

The rate of production by heterotrophs is called sec-
ondary productivity. Because herbivores and carnivores
cannot carry out photosynthesis, they do not manufac-
ture biomolecules directly from CO). Instead, they ob-
tain them by eating plants or other heterotrophs. Sec-
ondary productivity by herbivores is approximately an
order of magnitude less than the primary productivity
upon which it is based. Where does all the energy in
plants that is not captured by herbivores go (figure
28.10)? First, much of the biomass is not consumed by
herbivores and instead supports the decomposer commu-
nity (bacteria, fungi and detritivorous animals). Second,
some energy is not assimilated by the herbivore’s body
but is passed on as feces to the decomposers. Third, not
all the chemical-bond energy which herbivores assimilate
is retained as chemical-bond energy in the organic mole-
cules of their tissues. Some of it is lost as heat produced
by work.

 

Primary productivity occurs as a result of
photosynthesis, which is carried out by green plants,
algae, and some bacteria. Secondary productivity is the
production of new biomass by heterotrophs.

How heterotrophs utilize food energy. A heterotroph
assimilates only a fraction of the energy it consumes. For example,
if the “bite” of a herbivorous insect comprises 500 Joules of
energy (1 Joule = 0.239 calories), about 50%, 250], is lost in feces,
about 33%, 165 J, is used to fuel cellular respiration, and about
17%, 85 J, is converted into insect biomass. Only this 85 J is
available to the next trophic level.
