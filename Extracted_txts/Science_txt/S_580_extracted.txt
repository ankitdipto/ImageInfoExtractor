Interactions among Different
Trophic Levels

The existence of food webs creates the possibility of inter-
actions among species at different trophic levels. Predators
will not only have effects on the species upon which they
prey, but also, indirectly, upon the plants eaten by these
prey. Conversely, increases in primary productivity will not
only provide more food for herbivores but, indirectly, lead
also to more food for carnivores.

Trophic Cascades

When we look at the world around us, we see a profusion
of plant life. Why is this? Why don’t herbivore populations
increase to the extent that all available vegetation is con-
sumed? The answer, of course, is that predators keep the
herbivore populations in check, thus allowing plant popula-
tions to thrive. This phenomenon, in which the effect of
one trophic level flows down to lower levels, is called a
trophic cascade.

Experimental studies have confirmed the existence of
trophic cascades. For example, in one study in New
Zealand, sections of a stream were isolated with a mesh that
prevented fish from entering. In some of the enclosures,
brown trout were added, whereas other enclosures were left
without large fish. After 10 days, the number of inverte-
brates in the trout enclosures was one-half of that in the
controls (figure 28.14). In turn, the biomass of algae, which
invertebrates feed upon, was five times greater in the trout
enclosures than in the controls.

The logic of trophic cascades leads to the prediction that
a fourth trophic level, carnivores that preyed on other car-
nivores, would also lead to cascading effects. In this case,
the top predators would keep lower-level predator popula-
tions in check, which should lead to a profusion of herbi-
vores and a paucity of vegetation. In an experiment similar
to the one just described, enclosures were created in free-
flowing streams in northern California. In this case, large
predatory fish were added to some enclosures and not oth-
ers. In the large fish enclosures, the number of smaller
predators, such as damselfly nymphs was greatly reduced,
leading to an increase in their prey, including algae-cating
insects, which lead, in turn, to decreases in the biomass of

algae (figure 28.15).

FIGURE 28.15

Four-level trophic cascades. Streams with fish have fewer lower-
level predators, such as damselflies, more herbivorous insects
(exemplified by the number of chironomids, a type of aquatic
insect), and lower levels of algae.
