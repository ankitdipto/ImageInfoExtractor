through, whereas others produced light or deep shade.
The result was that the enclosures differed in the amount
of sunlight reaching them. As one might expect, the pri-
mary productivity differed and was greatest in the un-
shaded enclosures. This increased productivity led to
both more vegetation and more predators, but the
trophic level sandwiched in between, the herbivores, did
not increase, precisely as the bottom-up hypothesis pre-

dicted (figure 28.17).

Relative Importance of Trophic Cascades and
Bottom-Up Effects

Neither trophic cascades nor bottom-up effects are in-
evitable. For example, if two species of herbivores exist in
an ecosystem and compete strongly, and if one species is
much more vulnerable to predation than the other, then
top-down effects will not propagate to the next lower
trophic level. Rather, increased predation will simply de-
crease the population of the vulnerable species while in-
creasing the population of its competitor, with potentially
no net change on the vegetation in the next lower trophic
level.

Similarly, productivity increases might not move up
through all trophic levels. In some cases, for example, prey
populations increase so quickly that their predators cannot
control them. In such cases, increases in productivity would
not move up the food chain.

In other cases, trophic cascades and bottom-up effects
may reinforce each other. In one experiment, large fish
were removed from one lake, leaving only minnows, which
ate most of the algae-eating zooplankton. By contrast, in
the other lake, there were few minnows and much zoo-
plankton. The researchers then added nutrients to both
lakes. In the minnow lake, there were few zooplankton, so
the resulting increase in algal productivity did not propa-
gate up the food chain and large mats of algae formed. By
comparison, in the large fish lake, increased productivity
moved up the food chain and algae populations were con-
trolled. In this case, both top-down and bottom-up
processes were operating.

Nature, of course, is not always so simple. In some cases,
species may simultaneously operate on multiple trophic
levels, such as the jaguar which eats both smaller carnivores
and herbivores, or the bear which eats both fish and
berries. Nature is often much more complicated than a
simple, linear food chain, as figure 28.9 indicates. Ecolo-
gists are currently working to apply theories of food chain
interactions to these more complicated situations.

 

Because of the linked nature of food webs, species on
different trophic levels will effect each other, and these
effects can promulgate both up and down the food web.

FIGURE 28.17

Bottom-up effects on a stream ecosystem. As predicted,
increases in productivity—which are a function of the amount of
light hitting the stream and leading to photosynthesis—lead to
increases in the amount of vegetation. However, herbivore
biomass does not increase with increased productivity because it is
converted into predator biomass.
