¢ Fully 98% of the water on earth cycles through the
atmosphere. In the United States, 96% of the fresh
water is groundwater.

¢ About 10% of the roughly 700 billion metric tons of
free carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is fixed each
year through photosynthesis. About as much carbon
exists in living organisms at any one time as is present
in the atmosphere.

* Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have gaseous or liquid
reservoirs, as does water. All of the other nutrients,
such as phosphorus, are contained in solid mineral
reservoirs.

¢ Phosphorus is a key component of many biological
molecules; it weathers out of soils and is transported
to the world’s oceans.

28.2 Ecosystems are structured by who eats whom.

1, What are the primary
reservoirs for the chemicals in
biogeochemical cycles? Are

more of the life-sustaining
chemicals found in these
reservoirs or in the earth’s living
organisms?

2. What is denitrification?
Which organisms carry it out?

3. How is the phosphorus cycle
different from the water, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen cycles?
What are the natural sources for
phosphorus?

4. What effect does
deforestation have on the water
cycle and overall fertility of the
land?

¢ Plants convert about 1 to 5% of the light energy that
falls on their leaves to food energy. Producers, the
herbivores that eat them, and the carnivores that eat
the herbivores constitute three trophic levels.

* Atcach level, only about 10% of the energy available
in the food is fixed in the body of the consumer. For
this reason, food chains are always relatively short.

28.3 Energy flows through ecosystems.

5. How might an increase in the
number of predators affect lower
levels of a food chain. How
might an increase in nutrients
affect upper levels?

¢ The primary productivity of a community is a
measure of the biomass photosynthesis produces
within it

* As energy passes through the trophic levels of an
ecosystem, much is lost at each step. Ecological
pyramids reflect this energy loss.

28.4 Biodiversity promotes ecosystem stability.

6. What is the difference
between primary productivity,
gross primary productivity, and
net primary productivity?

7. Which type of diet,
carnivorous or herbivorous,
provides more food value to any
given living organism?

Exponential
Population Growth

¢ Increasing the number of species in a community
seems to promote ecosystem productivity.
Controversial experiments suggest that communities
with increased species richness are more stable and
less vulnerable to disturbance.

8. Why might rain forests have
high levels of species diversity?

9. Why do distant islands tend
to have fewer species than nearer
islands of the same size? Why do
different-sized islands tend to
differ in species number?
