Biomes and Climate

Many different environmental factors play a role in deter-
mining which biomes are found where. Two key parame-
ters are available moisture and temperature. Figure 29.11
presents data on ecosystem productivity as a function of an-
nual precipitation and of annual mean temperature: ecosys-
tem productivity is strongly influenced by both. This is not
to say that other factors such as soil structure and its min-
eral composition (discussed in detail in chapter 39), or sea~
sonal versus constant climate, are not also important. Dif-
ferent places with the same annual precipitation and
temperature sometimes support different biomes, so other
factors must also be important. Nevertheless, these two
variables do a fine job of predicting what biomes will occur
in most places, as figure 29.12 illustrates.

If there were no mountains and no climatic effects
caused by the irregular outlines of continents and by differ-
ent sea temperatures, each biome would form an even belt
around the globe, defined largely by latitude. In truth,
these other factors also greatly affect the distribution of
biomes. Distance from the ocean has a major impact on
rainfall, and elevation affects temperature—the summits of
the Rocky Mountains are covered with a vegetation type
that resembles the tundra which normally occurs at a much
higher latitude.

‘Temperature and precipitation are excellent predictors of biome distribution. At mean annual precipitations between 50 and
150 cm, other factors such as seasonal drought, fire, and grazing also have a major influence on biome distribution.
