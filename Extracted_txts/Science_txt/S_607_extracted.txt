* Organisms employ physiological, morphological, and
behavioral mechanisms to cope with variations in the
environment.

29.2 Climate shapes the character of ecosystems.

1, What are several ways that
individual organisms adjust to
changes in temperature during
the course of a year?

¢ Warm air rises near the equator and flows toward the
poles, descending at about 30° north and south
latitude. Because the air falls in these regions, it is
warmed, and its moisture-holding capacity increases.

2. Why are the majority of great
deserts located near 30° north
and south latitude? Is it more
likely that a desert will form in
the interior or at the edge of a

¢ The ocean contains three major environments: the
neritic zone, the pelagic zone, and the benthic zone.

* The neritic zone, which lies along the coasts, is small
in area but very productive and rich in species.

© The surface layers of the pelagic zone are home to
plankton (drifting organisms) and nekton (actively
swimming ones). The productivity of this zone has
been underestimated because of the very small size
(less than 10 mm) of many of its key organisms and
because of its rapid turnover of nutrients.

* The benthic zone is home to a surprising number of
species.

¢ Freshwater habitats constitute only about 2.1% of the
earth’s surface; most are ponds and lakes. These
possess a littoral zone, a limnetic zone, and a
profundal zone. The waters in these zones mix
seasonally, delivering oxygen to the bottom and
nutrients to the surface.

4, What is the difference

between plankton and nekton in
the ocean’s pelagic zone? How
important are the photosynthetic
plankton to the survival of the
earth? Is the turnover of
nutrients in the surface zone
slow or fast?

5. What conditions of the
abyssal zone led early deep-sea
biologists to believe nothing
lived there? What provides the
energy for the deep-sea
communities found around
thermal vents? What kind of
organisms live there?

6. Does much diversity occur in
the abyssal zone? How are such
ecosystems supported in the
absence of light?

7. What is the difference
between a eutrophic and an
oligotrophic lake? Why have
humans increased the frequency
of lakes becoming eutrophied?
