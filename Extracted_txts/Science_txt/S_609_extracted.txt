 

A Growing Population

The current world population of 6 billion people is plac-
ing severe strains on the biosphere. How did it grow so
large? For the past 300 years, the human birthrate (as a
global average) has remained nearly constant, at about 30
births per year per 1000 people. Today it is about 25
births per year per 1000 people. However, at the same
time, better sanitation and improved medical techniques
have caused the death rate to fall steadily, from about 29
deaths per 1000 people per year to 13 per 1000 per year.
Thus, while the birthrate has remained fairly constant
and may have even decreased slightly, the tremendous
fall in the death rate has produced today’s enormous pop-
ulation. The difference between the birth and death rates
amounts to an annual worldwide increase of approxi-
mately 1.4%. This rate of increase may seem relatively
small, but it would double the world’s population in only
39 years!

The annual increase in world population today is nearly
77 million people, about equal to the current population of
Germany. 210,000 people are added to the world each day,
or more than 140 every minute! The world population is
expected to continue beyond its current level of 6 billion
people, perhaps stabilizing at a figure anywhere between
8.5 billion and 20 billion during the next century.

The Future Situation

About 60% of the people in the world live in tropical or
subtropical regions (figure 30.2). An additional 20% will be
living in China, and the remaining 20% in the developed
or industrialized countries: Europe, the successor states of
the Soviet Union, Japan, United States, Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand. Although populations of industrialized
countries are growing at an annual rate of about 0.3%,
those of the developing, mostly tropical countries (exclud-
ing China) are growing at an annual rate estimated in 1995
to be about 2.2%. For every person living in an industrial-
ized country like the United States in 1950, there were two
people living elsewhere; in 2020, just 70 years later, there
will be five.

As you learned in chapter 24, the age structure of a
population determines how fast the population will grow.
To predict the future growth patterns of a population, it is
essential to know what proportion of its individuals have
not yet reached childbearing age. In industrialized coun-
tries such as the United States, about a fifth of the popula-
tion is under 15 years of age; in developing countries such
as Mexico, the proportion is typically about twice as high.
Even if most tropical and subtropical countries consis-
tently carry out the policies they have established to limit
population growth, their populations will continue to grow
well into the twenty-first century (figure 30.3), and indus-

FIGURE 30.2

Anticipated growth of the global human population. Despite
considerable progress in lowering birthrates, the human
population will continue to grow for another century (data are
presented above on a log scale). Much of the growth will center in
sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region on the globe, where the
population could reach over 2 billion. Fertility rates there
currently range from 3 to more than 5 children per woman,
compared to fewer than 2.1 in Europe and the United States.

trialized countries will constitute a smaller and smaller
proportion of the world’s population. If India, with a 1995
population level of about 930 million people 36% under
15 years old), managed to reach a simple replacement re-
productive rate by the year 2000, its population would still
not stop growing until the middle of the twenty-first cen-
tury. At present rates of growth, India will have a popula-
tion of nearly 1.4 billion people by 2025 and will still be
growing rapidly.
