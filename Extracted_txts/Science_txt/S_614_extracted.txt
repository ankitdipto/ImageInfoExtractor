 

Carbon Dioxide and 372
Global Warming

By studying earth’s history and mak-
ing comparisons with other planets,
scientists have determined that con-
centrations of gases in the atmo-
sphere, particularly carbon dioxide, 356
maintain the average temperature on
earth about 25°C higher than it
would be if these gases were absent.
Carbon dioxide and other gases trap
the longer wavelengths of infrared

 

light, or heat, radiating from the
surface of the earth, creating what is
known as a greenhouse effect (fig-
ure 30.5). The atmosphere acts like
the glass of a gigantic greenhouse
surrounding the earth.

Roughly seven times as much car-
bon dioxide is locked up in fossil
fuels as exists in the atmosphere
today. Before industrialization, the
concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere was approximately
260 to 280 parts per million (ppm).
Since the extensive use of fossil
fuels, the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere has been increas-

tion of carbon dioxide increased
from 315 ppm to more than 340
ppm and continues to rise. Climatol-
ogists have calculated that the actual
mean global temperature has in-
creased about 1°C since 1900, a
change known as global warming.
In a recent study, the U.S. Na-
tional Research Council estimated that the concentration

of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would pass 600 ppm
(roughly double the current level) by the third quarter of
the next century, and might exceed that level as soon as
2035. These concentrations of carbon dioxide, if actually
reached, would warm global surface air by between 1.5°
and 4.5°C. The actual increase might be considerably
greater, however, because a number of trace gases, such
as nitrous oxide, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocar-
bons, are also increasing rapidly in the atmosphere as a
result of human activities. These gases have warming, or
“greenhouse,” effects similar to those of carbon dioxide.
One, methane, increased from 1.14 ppm in the atmo-
sphere in 1951 to 1.68 ppm in 1986—nearly a 50%
increase.

Major problems associated with climatic warming in-
clude rising sea levels. Sea levels may have already risen

increased since the 1950s (blue line). The red line shows the general increase in average global
temperature for the same period of time.

2 to 5 centimeters from global warming. If the climate be-
comes so warm that the polar ice caps melt, sea levels
would rise by more than 150 meters, flooding the entire
Atlantic coast of North America for an average distance of
several hundred kilometers inland.

Changes in the distribution of precipitation are difficult
to model. Certainly, changing climatic patterns are likely to
make some of the best farmlands much drier than they are
at present. If the climate warms as rapidly as many scien-
tists project, the next 50 years may see greatly altered
weather patterns, a rising sea level, and major shifts of
deserts and fertile regions.

 

As the global concentration of carbon dioxide increases,
the world’s temperature is rising, with great potential
impact on the world’s climate.
