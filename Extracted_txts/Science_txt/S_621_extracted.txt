¢ Population growth rates are declining throughout
much of the world, but still the human population
increases by 77 million people per year. At this rate,
the global population will double in 39 years.

* An explosively growing human population is placing
considerable stress on the environment. People in the
developed world consume resources at a vastly higher
rate than those in the nondeveloped world. Such high
levels of consumption are not sustainable and are as
important a problem as global overpopulation.

1, What biological event
fostered the rapid growth of
human populations? How did
this event affect the location in
which humans lived? What
major cultural event eventually
took place?

2. Why, in some respects, is the

population size of the developed
world more of a consideration in
discussing resource use than the

population of the nondeveloped

world?

30.2 Improvements in agriculture are needed to feed a hungry world.

* History of Human
Population

@

 

¢ Much current effort is focused on improving the
productivity of existing crops, although the search for
new crops continues.

3. What three species supply
more than half of the human
energy requirements on earth?
How many plants supply over
90%?

30.3. Human activity is placing the environment under increasing stress.

* Food Needs

* Food Production

* Future Agricultural
Prospects

* Land Degradation

* Agriculture-Related
Problems

 

¢ Human activities present many challenges to the
environment, including the release of harmful
materials into the environment.

* Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which
may increase the world’s temperature and alter
weather and ocean levels.

* Release of pollutants into rivers may make the water
unfit for aquatic life and human consumption.

¢ Release of industrial smoke into the upper
atmosphere leads to acid precipitation that kills
forests and lakes.

* Release of chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons may
destroy the atmosphere’s ozone and expose the world
to dangerous levels of ultraviolet radiation.

¢ Cutting and burning the tropical rain forests of the
world to make pasture and cropland is producing a
massive wave of extinction.

4, What problems must we
master before nuclear power’s
full potential can be realized?

5. Why were chlorinated
hydrocarbons banned in the
United States? Why can you still
find them as contaminants on
fruits and vegetables?

6. How does acid precipitation
form? Why has it been difficult
to implement solutions to this
problem?

7. What is the ozone layer? How
is it formed? What are the
harmful effects of decreasing the
earth’s ozone layer? What may
be the primary cause of this
damage?

30.4 Solving environmental problems requires individual involvement.

* Global Warming

* Bioaccumulation

* Acid Rain

* Ozone Layer
Depletion

Warming

¢ All of these challenges to our future can and must be
addressed. Today, environmental scientists and
concerned citizens are actively searching for
constructive solutions to these problems.

take that would make a
significant contribution to
