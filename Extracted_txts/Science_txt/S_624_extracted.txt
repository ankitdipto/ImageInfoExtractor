“There has been an alarming decline in amphibian populations recently, and many species may be on the verge of extinction.

in table 31.1, based on the best available evidence, shows
recorded extinctions from 1600 to the present. These es-
timates indicate that about 85 species of mammals and
113 species of birds have become extinct since the year
1600. That is about 2.1% of known mammal species and
1.3% of known birds. The majority of extinctions have
come in the last 150 years. The extinction rate for birds
and mammals was about one species every decade from
1600 to 1700, but it rose to one species every year during
the period from 1850 to 1950, and four species per year
between 1986 and 1990 (figure 31.3). It is this increase in
the rate of extinction that is the heart of the biodiversity
crisis.

The majority of historic extinctions—though by no
means all of them—have occurred on islands. For example,
of the 90 species of mammals that have gone extinct in the
last 500 years, 73% lived on islands (and another 19% on
Australia). The particular vulnerability of island species
probably results from a number of factors: such species
have often evolved in the absence of predators and so have
lost their ability to escape both humans and introduced
predators such as rats and cats. In addition, humans have
introduced competitors and diseases (avian malaria, for ex-
ample has devastated the bird fauna of the Hawaiian Is-
lands). Finally, island populations are often relatively small,
and thus particularly vulnerable to extinction, as we shall
see later in the chapter.

In recent years, however, the extinction crisis has moved
from islands to continents. Most species now threatened
with extinction occur on continents, and it is these areas
which will bear the brunt of the extinction crisis in this
century.

Some people have argued that we should not be con-
cerned because extinctions are a natural event and mass
extinctions have occurred in the past. Indeed, as we saw
in chapter 21, mass extinctions have occurred several
times over the past half billion years. However, the cur-
rent mass extinction event is notable in several respects.
First, it is the only such event triggered by a single

limited knowledge of other groups).

species. Moreover, although species diversity usually re-
covers after a few million years, this is a long time to
deny our descendants the benefits and joys of biodiver-
sity. In addition, it is not clear that biodiversity will re-
bound this time. After previous mass extinction events,
new species have evolved to utilize resources available
due to species extinctions. Today, however, such re-
sources are unlikely to be available, because humans are
destroying the habitats and taking the resources for their
own use.

 

Biologists estimate rates of extinction both by studying
recorded extinction events and by analyzing trends in
habitat loss and disruption. Since prehistoric times,
humans have had a devastating effect on biodiversity
almost everywhere in the world.
