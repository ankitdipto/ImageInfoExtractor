Factors Responsible For Extinction

Because a species is rare does not necessarily mean that it is
in danger of extinction. The habitat it utilizes may simply
be in short supply, preventing population numbers from
growing. In a similar way, shortage of some other resource
may be limiting the size of populations. Secondary carni-
vores, for example, are usually rare because so little energy
is available to support their populations. Nor are vulnerable
species such as those categories discussed in the previous
section always threatened with extinction. Many local en-
demics are quite stable and not at all threatened.

Tf it’s not just size or vulnerability, what factors are re-
sponsible for extinction? Studying a wide array of recorded
extinctions and many species currently threatened with ex-
tinction, conservation biologists have identified a few fac-
tors that seem to play a key role in many extinctions: over-
exploitation, introduced species, disruption of ecological
relationships, loss of genetic variability, and habitat loss and
fragmentation (figure 31.8 and table 31.3).

 

Most recorded extinctions can be attributed to one of
five causes: overexploitation, introduced species,
ecodisruption, loss of genetic variability, and habitat
loss and fragmentation.
