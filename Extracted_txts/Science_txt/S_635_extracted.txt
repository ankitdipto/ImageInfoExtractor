Case Study: Disruption of
Ecological Relationships—Black-
Footed Ferrets

The black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) is one of the most
attractive weasels of North America. A highly specialized
predator, black-footed ferrets prey on prairie dogs, which
live in large underground colonies connected by a maze of
tunnels. These ferrets have experienced a dramatic decline
in their North American range during this century, as agri-
cultural development has destroyed their prairie habitat,
and particularly the prairie dogs on which they feed (figure
31.17). Prairie dogs once roamed freely over 100 million
acres of the Great Plains states, but are now confined to
under 700,000 acres (table 31.4). Their ecological niche
devastated, populations of the black-footed ferret collapsed.
Increasingly rare in the second half of the century, the
black-footed ferret was thought to have gone extinct in the
late 1970s, when the only known wild population—a small
colony in South Dakota—died out.

In 1981, a colony of 128 animals was located in Mee-
teese, Wyoming. Left undisturbed for four years, the num-
ber of ferrets dropped by 50%, and the entire population
seemed in immediate danger of extinction. A decision was
made to capture some animals for a captive breeding pro-
gram. The first six black-footed ferrets captured died of ca-
nine distemper, a disease present in the colony and proba-
bly responsible for its rapid decline.

At this point, drastic measures seemed called for. In the
next year, a concerted effort was made to capture all the
remaining ferrets in the Meeteese colony. A captive popu-
lation of 18 individuals was established before the Mee-
teese colony died out. The breeding program proved a
great success, the population jumping to 311 individuals
by 1991.

In 1991, biologists began to attempt to reintroduce
black-footed ferrets to the wild, releasing 49 animals in
Wyoming. An additional 159 were released over the next
two years. Six litters were born that year in the wild, and
the reintroduction seemed a success. However, the re-
leased animals then underwent a drastic decline, and only
ten individuals were still alive in the wild five years later in
1998. The reason for the decline is not completely under-
stood, but predators such as coyotes appear to have played
a large role. Current attempts at reintroduction involve
killing the local coyotes. It is important that these attempts
succeed, as numbers of offspring in the captive breeding
colony are declining, probably as a result of the intensive
inbreeding. The black-footed ferret still teeters at the
brink of extinction.

 

Loss of its natural prey has eliminated black-footed
ferrets from the wild; attempts to reintroduce them
have not yet proven successful.

Teetering on the brink. The black-footed ferret is a predator of
prairie dogs, and loss of prairie dog habitat as agriculture came to
dominate the plains states in this century has led to a drastic
decline in prairie dogs, and an even more drastic decline in the
black-footed ferrets that feed on them. Attempts are now being
made to reestablish natural populations of these ferrets, which
have been extinct in the wild since 1986.
