¢ Early humans caused many extinctions when they
appeared in new areas, but rates of extinction have
increased in modern times.

* Some areas are particularly rich in species diversity
and particularly merit conservation attention.

1. Are some areas particularly
important for conserving
biodiversity?

2. Describe some of the indirect
economic values of biodiversity.

31.2 Vulnerable species are more likely to become extinct.

¢ Interdependence among species in an ecosystem leads
to the possibility of cascading extinctions if removal
of one species has major effects throughout the food
web.

* Species are particularly vulnerable when they have
localized distributions, are declining in population
size, lack genetic variability, or are harvested or
hunted by humans.

3. What factors contribute to
the extinction rate on a
particular piece of land?

4. How does a low genetic
variability contribute to a
species’ greater risk of
extinction?

31.3 Causes of endangerment usually reflect human activities.

* Extinction

 

¢ Habitat loss is the single most important cause of
species extinction.

¢ As suggested by the species-area relationship, a
reduced habitat will support fewer numbers of
species.

¢ This reduction in habitat can occur in four different
ways: a habitat can be completely removed or
destroyed, a habitat can become fragmented and
disjunct, a habitat can be degraded or altered, or a
habitat can become too frequently used by humans so
as to disturb the species there.

5. How can problems resulting
from lack of genetic diversity
within a population be solved?

6. How can extinction of a
keystone species be particularly
disruptive to an ecosystem?

31.4 Successful recovery plans will need to be multidimensional.

¢ Pristine restoration of a habitat may be attempted,
but removing introduced species, rehabilitating the
habitat, and cleaning up the habitat may be more
feasible.

* Captive propagation, sustaining genetic variability,
and preserving keystone species have been effective in
preserving biodiversity.

* Megareserves have been successfully designed in
many parts of the world to contain core areas of
undisturbed habitat surrounded by managed land.

7. Why is maintaining large
preserves particularly important?

8. Is captive propagation always
an answer to species
vulnerability?

9, Why is it important to
attempt to eradicate introduced
species soon after they appear?
