LEARNING BY EXPERIENCE

1. Consider the following scenario: you are the leader of a tropical country that is very poor, has a rapidly growing

N

human population, and is rapidly losing its forests for three main reasons — harvesting to sell the lumber to other
countries, clearing land to graze cattle to export beef, and clearing by subsistence-level farmers (which are the
majority of your citizens). You are under pressure from international conservation organizations to stop or at
least decrease the loss of the tropical forests and all their resident species. What do you do? What do you think
your Minister of the Environment, Minister of Economics, and Minister of Human Welfare will advise you to
do? [Write out your answer, or stage a discussion/debate with some of your classmates — each could play a
different role and represent a different viewpoint. Remember, these are complex issues and there are no easy
answers. ]

While restoring a severely degraded ecosystem to pristine conditions is an admirable goal, it is virtually
impossible to do. List the reasons why this is so.

Draw a design for a megareserve, labeling the different use zones and explaining why you chose the design you
did.
