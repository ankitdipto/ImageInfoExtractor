The estimated number or density of individuals
necessary for a population to maintain or
increase its numbers is called the

gaa ge

minimum viable population (MVP)
population viability analysis (PVA)
community importance factor (CIF)
metapopulation

carrying capacity

Use the following scenario to answer Questions
17-19. Tropical forests in South America are
being clear cut, but patches of the original forest
are being left in various sizes, surrounded by
clear cut areas. Scientists are monitoring three
such patches: A is 10,000 acres in size, B is
1,000 acres and C is 100 acres. In which of the
patches would you expect to see the greatest
decrease in both the size of populations (number
of individuals) and the number of species

present?

a A

b B
