A tree of life. This phylogeny, prepared from rRNA analyses, shows the evolutionary relationships among the three domains. The base of
the tree was determined by examining genes that are duplicated in all three domains, the duplication presumably having occurred in the
common ancestor. When one of the duplicates is used to construct the tree, the other can be used to root it. This approach clearly
indicates that the root of the tree is within the eubacterial domain. Archaebacteria and eukaryotes diverged later and are more closely

related to each other than either is to eubacteria.

Domain Bacteria (Eubacteria)

The eubacteria are the most abundant organisms on earth.
There are more living eubacteria in your mouth than there
are mammals living on earth. Although too tiny to see with
the unaided eye, eubacteria play critical roles throughout
the biosphere. They extract from the air all the nitrogen
used by organisms, and play key roles in cycling carbon and
sulfur. Much of the world’s photosynthesis is carried out by
eubacteria. However, certain groups of eubacteria are also
responsible for many forms of disease. Understanding their
metabolism and genetics is a critical part of modern medi-
cine.

There are many different kinds of eubacteria, and the
evolutionary links between them are not well understood.
While there is considerable disagreement among taxono-
mists about the details of bacterial classification, most rec-
ognize 12 to 15 major groups of eubacteria. Comparisons
of the nucleotide sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
molecules are beginning to reveal how these groups are re-
lated to one another and to the other two domains. One
view of our current understanding of the “Tree of Life” is
presented in figure 32.11. The oldest divergences represent
the deepest rooted branches in the tree. The root of the
tree is within the eubacterial domain. The archaebacteria
and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than
to eubacteria and are on a separate evolutionary branch of
the tree, even though archaebacteria and eubacteria are
both prokaryotes.

 

Eubacteria are as different from archaebacteria as from.
eukaryotes.
