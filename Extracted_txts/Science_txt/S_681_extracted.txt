¢ Viruses are fragments of DNA or RNA surrounded
by protein that are able to replicate within cells by
using the genetic machinery of those cells.

¢ The simplest viruses use the enzymes of the host cell
for both protein synthesis and gene replication; the
more complex ones contain up to 200 genes and are
capable of synthesizing many structural proteins and
enzymes.

* Viruses are basically either helical or isometric. Most
isometric viruses are icosahedral in shape.

1. Why are viruses not
considered to be living
organisms?

2. How did early scientists come
to the conclusion that the
infectious agents associated with
hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle
were not bacteria?

3. What is the approximate size
range of viruses and type of
microscope is generally required
to visualize viruses?

33.2 Bacterial viruses exhibit two sorts of reproductive cycles.

* Characteristics of
‘Viruses

@

 

¢ Virulent bacteriophages infect bacterial cells by
injecting their viral DNA or RNA into the cell, where
it directs the production of new virus particles,
ultimately lysing the cell.

¢ Temperate bacteriophages, upon entering a bacterial
cell, insert their DNA into the cell genome, where
they may remain integrated into the bacterial genome
as a prophage for many generations.

33.3 HIV is a complex animal virus.

4, What is a bacteriophage?
How does a T4 phage infect a
host cell?

* Life Cycle of Viruses

 

¢ AIDS, a viral infection that destroys the immune
system, is caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus). After docking on a specific protein called CD4,
HIV enters the cell and replicates, destroying the cell.

* Considerable progress has been made in the
treatment of AIDS, particularly with drugs such as
protease inhibitors that block cleavage of HIV
polyproteins into functional segments.

5. What specific type of human
cell does the AIDS virus infect?
How does it recognize this
specific kind of cell?

6. How do many animal viruses
penetrate the host cell? How
does a plant virus infect its host?
How does a bacterial virus infect
its host?

33.4 Nonliving infectious agents are responsible for many human diseases.

¢ Viruses are responsible for many serious human
diseases. Some of the most serious, like AIDS and
Ebola, have only recently transferred to humans from
some other animal host.

¢ Proteins called prions may transmit serious brain
diseases from one individual to another.

7. Why is it so much more
difficult to treat a viral infection
than a bacterial one? Is this
different from treating bacterial
infections?

8. What is a prion? How does it
integrate into living systems?
