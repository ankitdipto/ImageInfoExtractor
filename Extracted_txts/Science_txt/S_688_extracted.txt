Bacteria
Key Characteristics

ARCHAEBACTERIA

 

Bacteria that are not members of the kingdom Eubacteria.
Mostly anaerobic with unusual cell walls. Some produce
methane. Others reduce sulfur.

EUBACTERIA

 

Gram-positive bacteria. Form branching filaments and produce
spores; often mistaken for fungi. Produce many commonly used
antibiotics, including streptomycin and tetracycline. One of the
most common types of soil bacteria; also common in dental
plaque.

Bacteria able to obtain their energy from inorganic chemicals.
Most extract chemical energy from reduced gases such as H>S
(hydrogen sulfide), NH; (ammonia), and CH, (methane). Play a
key role in the nitrogen cycle.

A form of photosynthetic bacteria common in both marine and
freshwater environments. Deeply pigmented; often responsible
for “blooms” in polluted waters.

Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. Do not form spores; usually
aerobic heterotrophs; cause many important diseases, including
bubonic plague and cholera.

Gram-negative bacteria. Exhibit gliding motility by secreting
slimy polysaccharides over which masses of cells glide; some
groups form upright multicelluar structures carrying spores
called fruiting bodies.

Gram-negative heterotrophic rods with polar flagella. Very
common form of soil bacteria; also contain many important plant
pathogens.

Small, gram-negative intracelluar parasites. Rickettsia life cycle
involves both mammals and arthropods such as fleas and ticks;
Rickettsia are responsible for many fatal human diseases,
including typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) and Rocky Mountain
spotted fever. Chlamydial infections are one of the most
common sexually transmitted diseases.

Long, coil-shaped cells. Common in aquatic environments; a
parasitic form is responsible for the disease syphilis.
