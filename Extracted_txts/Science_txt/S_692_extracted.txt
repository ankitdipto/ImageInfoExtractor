Epidemiology

Bacterial infection that can be transmitted through
contact or ingested. Rare except in sporadic
outbreaks. May be fatal.

Contracted through ingestion or contact with wound.
Produces acute toxic poison; can be fatal.

Urogenital infections with possible spread to
eyes and respiratory tract. Occurs worldwide;
increasingly common over past 20 years.

Causes severe diarrhea that can lead to death

by dehydration; 50% peak mortality if the disease
goes untreated. A major killer in times of crowding
and poor sanitation; over 100,000 died in Rwanda in
1994 during a cholera outbreak.

A dense collection of this bacteria on the surface of
teeth leads to secretion of acids that destroy minerals
in tooth enamel—sugar alone will not cause caries.

Acute inflammation and lesions of mucous
membranes. Spread through contact with infected
individual. Vaccine available.

STD, on the increase worldwide. Usually not fatal.

Chronic infection of the skin; worldwide incidence
about 10-12 million, especially in Southeast Asia.
Spread through contact with infected individuals.

Spread through bite of infected tick. Lesion
followed by malaise, fever, fatigue, pain, stiff neck,
and headache.

Originally thought to be caused by stress or diet, most
peptic ulcers now appear to be caused by this
bacterium; good news for ulcer sufferers as it can be
treated with antibiotics.

Killed ¥ of the population of Europe in the 14th
century; endemic in wild rodent populations of the
western U.S. today.

Acute infection of the lungs, often fatal without
treatment

An acute bacterial infection of the lungs, lymph, and
meninges. Its incidence is on the rise, complicated by
the development of new strains of the bacteria that
are resistant to antibiotics.

A systemic bacterial disease of worldwide incidence.
Less than 500 cases a year are reported in the U.S.
The disease is spread through contaminated water or
foods (such as improperly washed fruits and
vegetables). Vaccines are available for travelers.

Historically a major killer in times of crowding and
poor sanitation; transmitted from human to human
through the bite of infected lice and fleas. Typhus has
a peak untreated mortality rate of 70%.
