¢ Bacteria are the oldest and simplest organisms, but
they are metabolically much more diverse than all

other life-forms combined.

¢ Bacteria differ from eukaryotes in many ways, the
most important of which concern the degree of
internal organization within the cell.

1. Structural differences among
bacteria are not great. How are
different species of bacteria
recognized?

2. In what seven ways do
prokaryotes differ substantially
from eukaryotes?

34.2 Bacterial cell structure is more complex than commonly supposed.

¢ Most bacteria have cell walls that consist of a network
of polysaccharide molecules connected by

polypeptide cross-links.

* A bacterial cell does not possess specialized
compartments or a membrane-bounded nucleus, but
it may exhibit a nucleoid region where the bacterial

DNA is located.

3. What is the structure of the
bacterial cell wall? How does the
cell wall differ between gram-
positive and gram-negative
bacteria? In general, which type
of bacteria is more resistant to
the action of most antibiotics?
Why?

34.3 Bacteria exhibit considerable diversity in both structure and metabolism.

* The two bacterial kingdoms, Archaebacteria and
Eubacteria, are made up of prokaryotes, with about

5000 species named so far.

* The Archacbacteria differ markedly from Eubacteria
and from cukaryotes in their ribosomal sequences and

in other respects.

¢ Mutation and genetic recombination are important
sources of variability in bacteria.

¢ Many bacteria are autotrophic and make major
contributions to the world carbon balance. Others are
heterotrophic and play a key role in world ecology by
breaking down organic compounds.

¢ Some heterotrophic bacteria cause major diseases in

plants and animals.

4. How do the Archaebacteria
differ from the Eubacteria?
What unique metabolism do
they exhibit?

5. Why does mutation play such
an important role in creating
genetic diversity in bacteria?

6. How do heterotrophic
bacteria that are successful
pathogens overcome the many
defenses the human body uses to
ward off disease?

34.4 Bacteria are responsible for many diseases but also make important contributions to ecosystems.

 

¢ Human diseases caused by heterotrophic bacteria
include many fatal diseases that have had major
impacts on human history, including tuberculosis,
cholera, plague, and typhus.

¢ Bacteria play vital roles in cycling nutrients within
ecosystems. Certain bacteria are the only organisms
able to fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic
molecules, a process on which all life depends.

7. What are STDs? How are
they transmitted? Which STDs
are caused by viruses and which
are caused by bacteria? Why is
the cause of chlamydia unusual?
