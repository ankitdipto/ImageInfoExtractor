Key Characteristics

Move by pseudopodia
Glassy skeletons; needlelike pseudopods

Rigid shells; move by protoplasmic
streaming

Photosynthetic; unicellular; two flagella;
contain chlorophylls a and b

Some photosynthetic; others
heterotrophic; unicellular; contain
chlorophylls @ and b or none

Unicellular; manufacture the
carbohydrate chrysolaminarin; unique
double shells of silica; contain
chlorophylls a and Â¢

Unicellular, but often colonial;
manufacture the carbohydrate
chrysolaminarin; contain
chlorophylls a and c

Most multicellular; contain
chlorophyll a anda red pigment

Multicellular; contain chlorophylls a and c

Unicellular or multicellular; contain
chlorophylls @ and b

Heterotrophic; unicellular

Heterotrophic unicellular protists with
cells of fixed shape possessing two nuclei
and many cilia; many cells also contain
highly complex and specialized organelles

Nonmotile; unicellular; the apical end
of the spores contains a complex mass
of organelles

Terrestrial and freshwater

Colonial aggregations of individual cells;
most closely related to amoebas

Stream along as a multinucleate
mass of cytoplasm
