accumulations of their tests to the fossil record for more
than 200 million years. Because of the excellent preserva-
tion of their tests and the often striking differences among
them, forams are very important as geological markers.
The pattern of occurrence of different forams is often used
as a guide in searching for oil-bearing strata. Limestones
all over the world, including the famous white cliffs of

Dover in southern England, are often rich in forams (fig-
ure 35.10).

 

Amoebas, radiolarians, and forams are unicellular,
heterotrophic protists that lack cell walls, flagella,
meiosis, and sexuality. Amoebas move from place to
place by means of extensions called pseudopodia. The
pore-studded tests, or shells, of the forams have
openings through which podia extend that are used for
locomotion.

composed almost entirely of fossil shells of protists, including
coccolithophores (a type of algae) and foraminifera.
