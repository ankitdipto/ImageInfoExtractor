Pyrrhophyta: The
Dinoflagellates

The dinoflagellates consist of about
2100 known species of primarily uni-
cellular, photosynthetic organisms,
most of which have two flagella. A
majority of the dinoflagellates are ma-
rine, and they are often abundant in
the plankton, but some occur in fresh
water. Some planktonic dinoflagel-
lates are luminous and contribute to
the twinkling or flashing effects that
we sometimes see in the sea at night,
especially in the tropics.

The flagella, protective coats, and
biochemistry of dinoflagellates are
distinctive, and they do not appear to
be directly related to any other phy-
lum. Plates made of a cellulose-like
material encase the cells. Grooves
form at the junctures of these plates
and the flagella are usually located
within these grooves, one encircling
the body like a belt, and the other
perpendicular to it. By beating in
their respective grooves, these fla-
gella cause the dinoflagellate to ro-
tate like a top as it moves. The di-
noflagellates that are clad in stiff
cellulose plates, often encrusted with
silica, may have a very unusual ap-
pearance (figure 35.11). Most have
chlorophylls @ and ¢, in addition to
carotenoids, so that in the biochem-
istry of their chloroplasts, they re-
semble the diatoms and the brown
algae, possibly acquiring such chloro-
plasts by forming endosymbiotic re-
lationships with members of those
groups.

Some dinoflagellates occur as sym-
bionts in many other groups of or-
ganisms, including jellyfish, sea
anemones, mollusks, and corals.
When dinoflagellates grow as sym-
bionts within other cells, they lack
their characteristic cellulose plates
and flagella, appearing as spherical,
golden-brown globules in their host
cells. In such a state they are called
zooxanthellae. Photosynthetic
zooxanthellae provide their hosts
with nutrients. It is the photosynthe-
sis conducted by zooxanthellae that

Some dinoflagellates: Noctiluca,
Prychodiscus, Ceratium, and Gonyaulax.
Noetiluca, which lacks the heavy cellulose
armor characteristic of most dinoflagellates,
is one of the bioluminescent organisms that
causes the waves to sparkle in warm seas. In
the other three genera, the shorter, encircling
flagellum is seen in its groove, with the

longer one projecting away from the body of
the dinoflagellate. (Not drawn to scale.)

makes coral reefs one of the most pro-
ductive ecosystems on earth. Corals
primarily live in warm tropical seas
that are typically extremely low in nu-
trients; without the aid of their photo-
synthetic endosymbionts, they would
not be able to form large reefs in the
nutrient-poor environment. Most of
the carbon that the zooxanthellae fix is
translocated to the host corals.

The poisonous and destructive “red
tides” that occur frequently in coastal
areas are often associated with great
population explosions, or “blooms,” of
dinoflagellates. The pigments in the in-
dividual, microscopic cells of the di-
noflagellates are responsible for the
color of the water. Red tides have a pro-
found, detrimental effect on the fishing
industry in the United States. Some 20
species of dinoflagellates are known to
produce powerful toxins that inhibit the
diaphragm and cause respiratory failure
in many vertebrates. When the toxic di-
noflagellates are abundant, fishes, birds,
and marine mammals may die in large
numbers.

More recently, a particularly dan-
gerous toxic dinoflagellate called Pfies-
teria piscicida is reported to be a carniv-
orous, ambush predator. During
blooms, it stuns fish with its toxin and
then feeds on the prey’s body fluids.

Dinoflagellates reproduce primarily
by asexual cell division. But sexual re-
production has been reported to occur
under starvation conditions. They
have a unique form of mitosis in which
the permanently condensed chromo-
somes divide longitudinally within the
confines of a permanent nuclear enve-
lope. After the numerous chromo-
somes duplicate, the nucleus divides
into two daughter nuclei. Also the di-
noflagellate chromosome is unique
among eukaryotes in that the DNA is
not complexed with histone proteins.
In all other eukaryotes, the chromoso-
mal DNA is complexed with histones
to form nucleosomes, which represents
the first order of DNA packaging in
the nucleus. How dinoflagellates are
able to maintain distinct chromosomes
without histones and nucleosomes re-
mains a mystery.
