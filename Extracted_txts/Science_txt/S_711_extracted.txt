Heterotrophs with
Flagella

The phylum Sarcomastigophora con-
tains a diverse group of protists com-
bined into one phylum because they all
possess a single kind of nucleus and use
flagella or pseudopodia (or both) for
locomotion. We will focus on the class
Zoomastigophora.

Zoomastigophora: The
Zoomastigotes

The class Zoomastigophora is com-
posed of unicellular, heterotrophic or-
ganisms that are highly variable in
form (figure 35.17). Each has at least
one flagellum, with some species hav-
ing thousands. They include both free-
living and parasitic organisms. Many
zoomastigotes apparently reproduce
only asexually, but sexual reproduction
occurs in some species. The members
of one order, the kinetoplastids, in-
clude the genera Trypanosoma (figure
35.176) and Crithidia, pathogens of hu-
mans and domestic animals. The eug-
lenoids could be viewed as a special-
ized group of zoomastigotes, some of
which acquired chloroplasts during the
course of evolution.

Trypanosomes cause many serious
human diseases, the most familiar of
which is trypanosomiasis also known as
African sleeping sickness (figure
35.18). Trypanosomes cause many
other diseases including East Coast
fever, leishmaniasis, and Chagas’ dis-
case, all of great importance in tropical
areas where they afflict millions of
people each year. Leishmaniasis,
which is transmitted by sand flies, af-
flicts about 4 million people a year.
The effects of these diseases range
from extreme fatigue and lethargy in
sleeping sickness to skin sores and
deep eroding lesions that can almost
obliterate the face in leishmaniasis.
The trypanosomes that cause these
diseases are spread by biting insects,
including tsetse flies and assassin bugs.

A serious effort is now under way to
produce a vaccine for trypanosome-
caused diseases. These diseases make it

FIGURE 35.17

Three genera of zoomastigotes
(Zoomastigophora), a highly diverse
group. (a) Codosiga, a colonial
choanoflagellate that remains attached to its
substrate; other colonial choanoflagellates
swim around as a colony, resembling the
green alga Volvox in this respect. (b)
Trichonympha, one of the zoomastigotes that
inhabits the guts of termites and wood-
feeding cockroaches and digests cellulose
there. Trichonympha has rows of flagella in its
anterior regions. () Trypanosoma, which
causes sleeping sickness, an important
tropical disease. It has a single, anterior
flagellum.

impossible to raise domestic cattle for
meat or milk in a large portion of
Africa. Control is especially difficult
because of the unique attributes of
these organisms. For example, tsetse
fly-transmitted trypanosomes have
evolved an elaborate genetic mecha-
nism for repeatedly changing the anti-
genic nature of their protective glyco-
protein coat, thus dodging the
antibodies their hosts produce against
them (see chapter 57). Only a single
one out of some 1000 to 2000 variable
antigen genes is expressed at a time.
Rearrangements of these genes during
the asexual cycle of the organism allow
for the expression of a seemingly end-
less variety of different antigen genes
that maintain infectivity by the try-
panosomes.

When the trypanosomes are in-
gested by a tsetse fly, they embark on a
complicated cycle of development and
multiplication, first in the fly’s gut and
later in its salivary glands. It is their
position in the salivary glands that al-
lows them to move into their verte-
brate host.
observed between different strains of
trypanosomes introduced into a single
fly, thus suggesting that mating, syn-
gamy, and meiosis occur, even though
they have not been observed directly.
Although most trypanosome repro-
duction is asexual, this sexual cycle, re-
ported for the first time in 1986, af-
fords still further possibilities for
recombination in these organisms.

In the guts of the flies that spread
them, trypanosomes are noninfective.
When they are ready to transfer to the
skin or bloodstream of their host, try-
panosomes migrate to the salivary
glands and acquire the thick coat of
glycoprotein antigens that protect
them from the host’s antibodies. When
they are taken up by a fly, the try-
panosomes again shed their coats. The
production of vaccines against such a
system is complex, but tests are under-
way. Releasing sterilized flies to im-
pede the reproduction of populations is
another technique used to try to con-
trol the fly population. Traps made of
