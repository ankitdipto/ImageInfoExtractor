ciliates and makes them ideal organisms for the study of
certain aspects of genetics.

Progeny from a sexual division in Paramecium must go
through about 50 asexual divisions before they are able to
conjugate. When they do so, their biological clocks are
restarted, and they can conjugate again. After about 600
asexual divisions, however, Paramecium loses the protein
molecules around the gullet that enable it to recognize an
appropriate mating partner. As a result, the individuals are
unable to mate, and death follows about 100 generations
later. The exact mechanisms producing these unusual
events are unknown, but they involve the accumulation of a
protein, which is now being studied.

 

The zoomastigotes are a highly diverse group of
flagellated unicellular heterotrophs, containing among
their members the ancestors of animals as well as the
very primitive Giardia. Ciliates possess characteristic
cilia, and have two types of nuclei. The macronuclei
contain multiple copies of certain genes, while the
micronuclei contain multigene chromosomes.
