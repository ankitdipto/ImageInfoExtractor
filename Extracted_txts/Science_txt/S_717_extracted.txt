Oomycota

The oomycetes comprise about 580
species, among them the water molds,
white rusts, and downy mildews. All of
the members of this group are cither
parasites or saprobes (organisms that
live by feeding on dead organic mat-
ter). The cell walls of the oomycetes
are composed of cellulose or polymers
that resemble cellulose. They differ re-
markably from the chitin cell walls of
fungi, with which the oomycetes have
at times been grouped. Oomycete life
cycles are characterized by gametic
meiosis and a diploid phase; this also
differs from fungi. Mitosis in the
oomycetes resembles that in most
other organisms, while mitosis in fungi has a number of un-
usual features, as you will see in chapter 36. Filamentous
structures of fungi and, by convention, those of oomycetes,
are called hyphae. Most oomycetes live in fresh or salt
water or in soil, but some are plant parasites that depend on
the wind to spread their spores. A few aquatic oomycetes
are animal parasites.

Sporangium

 

Oomycetes are distinguished from
other protists by the structure of their
motile spores, or zoospores, which
bear two unequal flagella, one of
which is directed forward, the other
backward. Such zoospores are pro-
duced asexually in a sporangium. Sex-
ual reproduction in the group involves
gametangia (singular, ga-
metangium)—gamete-producing
structures—of two different kinds.
The female gametangium is called an
oogonium, and the male ga-
metangium is called an antheridium.
The antheridia contain numerous
male nuclei, which are the functional
male gametes; the oogonia contain
from one to eight eggs, which are the
female gametes. When the contents of
an antheridium flow into an oogo-
nium, it leads to the individual fusion
of male nuclei with eggs. This is followed by the thickening
of the cell wall around the resulting zygote or zygotes. This
produces a special kind of thick-walled cell called an
oospore, the structure that gives the phylum its name. De-
tails from the life cycle of one of the oomycetes, Saproleg-
nia, are shown in figure 35.24.
