FIGURE 35.27

Life cycle of a plasmodial slime mold. When food or moisture is scarce, a diploid plasmodium stops moving and forms sporangia.
Haploid spores form by meiosis. The spores wait until conditions are favorable to germinate. Spores can give rise to flagellated or
amoeboid gametes; the two forms convert from one to the other readily. Fusion of the gametes forms the diploid zygote, which gives rise
to the mobile, feeding plasmodium by mitosis.
