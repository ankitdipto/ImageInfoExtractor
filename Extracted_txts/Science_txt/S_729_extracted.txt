Phylum Ascomycota

The second phylum of fungi, the as-
comycetes (phylum Ascomycota), is a very
large group of about 32,000 named species,
with more being discovered each year.
Among the ascomycetes are such familiar
and economically important fungi as yeasts,
common molds, morels (figure 36.94,b), and
truffles. Also included in this phylum are
many serious plant pathogens, including the
chestnut blight, Cryphonectria parasitica, and
Dutch elm disease, Ophiostoma ulmi.

The ascomycetes are named for their
characteristic reproductive structure, the
microscopic, saclike ascus (plural, asci).
The zygotic nucleus, which is the only
diploid nucleus of the ascomycete life cycle (figure 36.9), is
formed within the ascus. The asci are differentiated within
a structure made up of densely interwoven hyphae, corre-
sponding to the visible portions of a morel or cup fungus,
called the ascocarp.

Asexual reproduction is very common in the as-
comycetes. It takes place by means of conidia (singular,

conidium), spores cut off by septa at the
ends of modified hyphae called conidio-
phores. Conidia allow for the rapid colo-
nization of a new food source. Many coni-
dia are multinucleate. The hyphae of
ascomycetes are divided by septa, but the
septa are perforated and the cytoplasm
flows along the length of each hypha. The
septa that cut off the asci and conidia are
initially perforated, but later become
blocked.

The cells of ascomycete hyphae may
contain from several to many nuclei. The
hyphae may be either homokaryotic or
heterokaryotic. Female gametangia,
called ascogonia, cach have a beaklike
outgrowth called a trichogyne. When
the antheridium, or male gametangium, forms, it fuses
with the trichogyne of an adjacent ascogonium. Initially,
both kinds of gametangia contain a number of nuclei.
Nuclei from the antheridium then migrate through the
trichogyne into the ascogonium and pair with nuclei of
the opposite mating type. Dikaryotic hyphae then arise
from the area of the fusion. Throughout such hyphae,
