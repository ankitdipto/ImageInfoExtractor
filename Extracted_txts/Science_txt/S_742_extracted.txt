Liverworts (Hepaticophyta)

The old English word wyrt means
“plant” or “herb.” Some common liver-
worts have flattened gametophytes with
lobes resembling those of liver—hence
the combination “liverwort.” Although
the lobed liverworts are the best-known
representatives of this phylum, they
constitute only about 20% of the
species (figure 37.6). The other 80%
are leafy and superficially resemble
mosses. Liverworts are less complex
than mosses. Gametophytes are pros-
trate instead of erect, and the rhizoids
are one-celled.

Some liverworts have air chambers
containing upright, branching rows of
photosynthetic cells, each chamber
having a pore at the top to facilitate gas
exchange. Unlike stomata, the pores
are fixed open and cannot close.

Sexual reproduction in liverworts is
similar to that in mosses. Lobed liver-
worts form gametangia in umbrella-
like structures. Asexual reproduction
occurs when lens-shaped pieces of
tissue that are released from the
gametophyte grow to form new
gametophytes.

Hornworts (Anthocerotophyta)

The origins of hornworts are a puzzle.
They are most likely among the earliest
land plants, yet the earliest fossil spores
date from the Cretaceous period, 65 to
145 million years ago, when an-
giosperms were emerging.

The small hornwort sporophytes re-
semble tiny green broom handles rising
from filmy gametophytes usually less
than 2 centimeters in diameter (figure
37.7). The sporophyte base is embed-
ded in gametophyte tissue, from which
it derives some of its nutrition. How-
ever, the sporophyte has stomata, is
photosynthetic, and provides much of
the energy needed for growth and re-
production. Hornwort cells usually
have a single chloroplast.

The three major phyla of
nonvascular plants are all relatively
unspecialized, but well suited for
diverse terrestrial environments.

state. The leafy gametophyte is photosynthetic, while the smaller sporophyte is not, and

is nutritionally dependent on the gametop!

Hornwort sporophytes are seen in this

bryophytes, these are photosynthetic, but
they also depend on the gametophyte for
nutrition.
