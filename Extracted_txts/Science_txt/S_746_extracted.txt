FIGURE 37.10

Life cycle of a typical fern. Both the gametophyte and
sporophyte are photosynthetic and can live independently.
Water is necessary for fertilization. The gametes are released
on the underside of the gametophyte and swim in moist soil to
neighboring gametophytes. Spores are dispersed by wind.

The sperm formed in the antheridia have flagella, with
which they swim toward the archegonia when water is pre-
sent, often in response to a chemical signal secreted by the
archegonia. One sperm unites with the single egg toward
the base of an archegonium, forming a zygote. The zygote
then develops into a new sporophyte, completing the life

cycle (figure 37.10). There are still multicellular gametan-
gia. As discussed earlier, the shift to a dominant sporophyte
generation allows ferns to achieve significant height with-
out interfering with sperm swimming efficiently to the egg.
The multicellular archegonia provide some protection for
the developing embryo.
