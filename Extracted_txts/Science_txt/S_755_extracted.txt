¢ Plants evolved from a multicellular, freshwater green
algae 450 million years ago. The evolution of their
conducting tissues, cuticle, stomata, and seeds has
made them progressively less dependent on external
water for reproduction.

* All plants have a haplodiplontic life cycle in which
haploid gametophytes alternate with diploid
sporophytes.

1. Where did the most recent
ancestors of land plants live?
What were they like? What
adaptations were necessary for
the “move” onto land?

2. What does it mean for a plant
to alternate generations?
Distinguish between sporophyte
and gametophyte.

37.2 Nonvascular plants are relatively unspecialized, but successful in many terrestrial environments.

 

* Three phyla of plants lack well-developed vascular
tissue, are the simplest in structure, and have been
grouped as bryophytes. This grouping does not
reflect a common ancestry or close relationship.

* Sporophytes of mosses, liverworts, and hornworts are
usually nutritionally dependent on the gametophytes,
which are more conspicuous and photosynthetic.

3. Distinguish between male
gametophytes and female
gametophytes. Which specific
haploid spores give rise to each
of these?

4, What reproductive limitations

would a moss tree (if one
existed) face?

* Non-Vascular Plants

37.3 Seedless vascular plants have well-developed conducting tissues in their sporophytes.

 

¢ Nine of the 12 plant phyla contain vascular plants,
which have two kinds of well-defined conducting
tissues: xylem, which is specialized to conduct water
and dissolved minerals; and phloem, which is
specialized to conduct the sugars produced by
photosynthesis and plant growth regulators.

¢ In ferns and other seedless vascular plants, the
sporophyte generation is dominant. The fern
sporophyte has vascular tissue and well-differentiated
roots, stems, and leaves.

5. In what ways are the
gametophytes of seedless plants

different from the gametophytes

of seed plants?

6. Which generation(s) of the
fern are nutritionally
independent?

37.4 Seeds protect and aid in the dispersal of plant embryos.

¢ Seeds were an important evolutionary advance
providing for a dormant stage in development.

¢ In gymnosperms, ovules are exposed directly to
pollen at the time of pollination; in angiosperms,
ovules are enclosed within an ovary, and a pollen tube
grows from the stigma to the ovule.

* The pollen of gymnosperms is usually disseminated
by wind. In most angiosperms the pollen is
transported by insects and other animals. Both
flowers and fruits are found only in angiosperms and
may account for the extensive colonization of
terrestrial environments by the flowering plants.

7. What is a seed? Why is the
seed a crucial adaptation to
terrestrial life?

8. What is the principal
difference between
gymnosperms and angiosperms?

9. If all the offspring of a plant
were to develop in a small area,
they would suffer from limited
resources. Compare dispersal
strategies in moss, pine, and
angiosperms.
