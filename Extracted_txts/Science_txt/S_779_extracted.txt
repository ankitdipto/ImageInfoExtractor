¢ A plant body is basically an axis that includes two
parts: root and shoot—with associated leaves. There
are four basic types of tissues in plants: meristems,
ground tissue, epidermis, and vascular tissue.

tissue systems in plants? What
are their functions?

¢ Epidermis forms an outer protective covering for the
plant.

¢ Vascular tissue conducts water, carbohydrates, and
dissolved minerals to different parts of the plant.
Xylem conducts water and minerals from the roots to
shoots and leaves, and phloem conducts food
molecules from sources to all parts of the plant.

38.3 Root cells differentiate as they become distanced from the dividing root apical meristem. ”——_—_Wetness

* Roots have four growth zones: the root cap, zone of
cell division, zone of elongation, and zone of
maturation.

* Some plants have modified roots, adapted for
photosynthesis, food or water storage, structural
support, or parasitism.

arrangement of the tissues
differ?

roots formed?

38.4 Stems are the backbone of the shoot, transporting nutrients and supporting the aerial plant organs.

 

* Plants branch by means of buds derived from the
primary apical meristem. They are found in the
junction between the leaf and the stem.

¢ The vascular cambium is a cylinder of dividing cells
found in both roots and shoots. As a result of their
activity, the girth of a plant increases.

6. What types of cells are
produced when the vascular
cambium divides outwardly,
inwardly, or laterally?

7. Why don’t monocots have
secondary growth?

¢ Leaves emerge as bulges on the meristem in a variety
of patterns, but most form a spiral around the stem.
The bulge lengthens and loses its radial symmetry as
it flattens.

*¢ Photosynthesis occurs in the ground tissue system
which is called mesophyll in the leaf. Vascular tissue
forms the venation patterns in the leaves, serving as
the endpoint for water conduction and often the
starting point for the transport of photosynthetically
produced sugars.
