Transpiration. Water evaporating from the leaves through the stomata causes the movement of water upward in the xylem and the

entrance of water through the roots.

Under certain circumstances, root pressure is so strong
that water will ooze out of a cut plant stem for hours or
even days. When root pressure is very high, it can force
water up to the leaves, where it may be lost in a liquid
form through a process known as guttation (figure 39.11).
Guttation does not take place through the stomata, but in-
stead occurs through special groups of cells located near
the ends of small veins that function only in this process.
Root pressure is never sufficient to push water up great
distances.

 

Water enters the plant by osmosis. Transport of
minerals (ions) across the endodermis is selective. Root
pressure, which often occurs at night, is caused by the
continued, active accumulation of ions in the roots at
times when transpiration from the leaves is very low or
absent.

Guttation. In herbaceous plants, water passes through specialized
groups of cells at the edges of the leaves; itis visible here as small

droplets around the edge of the leaf in this strawberry plant
(Fragaria ananassa).
