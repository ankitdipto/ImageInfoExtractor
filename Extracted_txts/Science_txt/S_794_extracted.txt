Diagram of mass flow. In this diagram, red dots represent sucrose molecules, and blue dots symbolize water molecules. Moving from the
mesophyll cells of a leaf or another part of the plant into the conducting cells of the phloem, the sucrose molecules are then transported to
other parts of the plant by mass flow and unloaded where they are required.

difference between the water potentials in the sieve tubes
and in the nearby xylem cells, water flows into the sieve
tubes by osmosis. Turgor pressure in the sieve tubes in-
creases. The increased turgor pressure drives the fluid
throughout the plant’s system of sieve tubes. At the sink,
carbohydrates are actively removed. Water moves from
the sieve tubes by osmosis and the turgor pressure there
drops, causing a mass flow from the higher pressure at
the source to the lower pressure sink (figure 39.17). Most

of the water at the sink diffuses then back into the xylem,
where it may either be recirculated or lost through
transpiration.

 

‘Transport of sucrose and other carbohydrates through
sieve tubes does not require energy. The loading and
unloading of these substances from the sieve tubes
does.
