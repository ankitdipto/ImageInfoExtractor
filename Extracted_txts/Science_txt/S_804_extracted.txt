Seeds can remain dormant for long periods. This seedling was
grown from a lotus seed recovered from the mud of a dry lake bed
in Manchuria, northern China. The radiocarbon age of this seed
indicates that it was formed around a.p. 1515. The coin is

included in the photo to give some idea of the size.

Specific adaptations often help ensure that the plant will
germinate only under appropriate conditions. Sometimes,
seeds lie within tough cones that do not open until they are
exposed to the heat of a fire (figure 40.10). This causes the
plant to germinate in an open, fire-cleared habitat; nutri-
ents will be relatively abundant, having been released from
plants burned in the fire. Seeds of other plants will germi-
nate only when inhibitory chemicals have been leached
from their seed coats, thus guaranteeing their germination
when sufficient water is available. Still other plants will ger-
minate only after they pass through the intestines of birds
or mammals or are regurgitated by them, which both weak-
ens the seed coats and ensures the dispersal of the plants in-
volved. Sometimes seeds of plants thought to be extinct in a
particular area may germinate under unique or improved
environmental circumstances, and the plants may then
reappear.

Seed dormancy is an important evolutionary factor in
plants, ensuring their survival in unfavorable conditions
and allowing them to germinate when the chances of
survival for the young plants are the greatest.

Fire induces seed germination in some pines. (a) Fire will
destroy these adult jack pines, but stimulate growth of the next
generation. ()) Cones of a jack pine are tightly sealed and cannot
release the seeds protected by the scales. (c) High temperatures
lead to the release of the seeds.
