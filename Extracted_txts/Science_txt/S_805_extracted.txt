How Fruits Form

Paralleling the evolution of angiosperm flowers, and nearly
as spectacular, has been the evolution of their fruits, which
are defined simply as mature ovaries (carpels). During seed
formation, the flower ovary begins to develop into fruit.
Fruits form in many ways and exhibit a wide array of spe-

Fruit formation enhances the dispersal of seeds.

cializations in relation to their dispersal. The differences
among some of the fruit types seen today are shown in fig-
ure 40.11. Three layers of ovary wall can have distinct fates
which accounts for the diversity of fruit types from fleshy
to dry and hard. An array of mechanisms allow for the re-
lease of the seed(s) within the fruits. Developmentally,
fruits are fascinating organs that contain three generations

 

Follicles

Split along one carpel edge only; milkweed,
larkspur.

Legumes

Split along two carpel edges with seeds at-
tached to carpel edges; peas, beans.

Samaras

Not split and with a wing formed from the
outer tissues; maples, elms, ashes.

 

Drupes True berries
Single seed enclosed in a hard pit; peaches,
plums, cherries.

 

Aggregate fruits
Derived from many ovaries of a single flower;
strawberries, blackberries.

802 Part XI Plant Growth and Reproduction

More than one seed and a thin skin; blue-
berries, tomatoes, grapes, peppers.

 

Hesperidiums
â€˜More than one seed and a leathery skin; or-
anges, lemons, limes.

FIGURE 40.11

Examples of some kinds of fruits. Distinguishing
features of each of these fruit types are listed below
each photo. Follicles, legumes, and samaras are
examples of dry fruits. Drupes, true berries, and
hesperidiums are simple fleshy fruits; they develop

from a flower with a single pistil. Aggregate and
multiple fruits are compound fleshy fruits; they develop
from flowers with more than one ovary or from more
than one flower.

Multiple fruits

Develop from a cluster of flowers; mulberries, pineapples.
