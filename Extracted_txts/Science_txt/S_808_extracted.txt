Aleurone

FIGURE 40.16

Hormonal regulation of seedling
growth. The germinating barley embryos
utilize the starch stored in the endosperm
by releasing the hormone gibberellic acid
(GA) that triggers the outer layers of the
endosperm (aleurone layers) to produce
the starch-digesting enzyme o-amylase.
The o-amylase breaks down starch into
sugar which moves through the scutellum
(cotyledon) into the embryo where it
provides energy for growth. A second
hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is important
in establishing dormancy and becomes
diluted as seeds imbibe water. When

there is excess ABA, the GA-triggered
production of alpha-amylase is inhibited.
