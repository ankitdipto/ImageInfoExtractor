Major Functions

Promotion of stem elongation

and growth; formation of
adventitious roots; inhibition of
leaf abscission; promotion of cell
division (with cytokinins);
inducement of ethylene production;
promotion of lateral bud dormancy
Stimulation of cell division,

but only in the presence of

auxin; promotion of chloroplast
development; delay of leaf aging;
promotion of bud formation

Promotion of stem elongation;
stimulation of enzyme production
in germinating seeds

Overlapping functions with
auxins and gibberellins

Pathogen defense, possibly
reproductive developmentz

Control of leaf, flower, and
fruit abscission; promotion
of fruit ripening

Inhibition of bud growth;
control of stomatal closure;
some control of seed dormancy;
inhibition of effects of other
hormones

Where Produced
or Found in Plant

Apical meristems; other
immature parts of plants

Root apical meristems;
immature fruits

Roots and shoot tips; young
leaves; seeds

Pollen, immature seeds,
shoots, leaves

Cell walls

Roots, shoot apical meristems;
leaf nodes; aging flowers;
ripening fruits

Leaves, fruits, root caps, seeds
