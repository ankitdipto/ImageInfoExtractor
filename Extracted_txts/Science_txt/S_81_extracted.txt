Eukaryotic Cells Have

Complex Interiors

Eukaryotic cells (figures 5.8 and 5.9) are
far more complex than prokaryotic cells.
The hallmark of the eukaryotic cell is
compartmentalization. The interiors of
eukaryotic cells contain numerous
organelles, membrane-bounded struc-
tures that close off compartments within
which multiple biochemical processes can
proceed simultaneously and indepen-
dently. Plant cells often have a large
membrane-bounded sac called a central
vacuole, which stores proteins, pigments,
and waste materials. Both plant and ani-
mal cells contain vesicles, smaller sacs
that store and transport a variety of mate-
rials. Inside the nucleus, the DNA is
