wound tightly around proteins and packaged into
compact units called chromosomes. All eukaryotic
cells are supported by an internal protein scaffold, the
cytoskeleton. While the cells of animals and some
protists lack cell walls, the cells of fungi, plants, and
many protists have strong cell walls composed of cel-
lulose or chitin fibers embedded in a matrix of other
polysaccharides and proteins. This composition is
very different from the peptidoglycan that makes up
bacterial cell walls. Let's now examine the structure
and function of the internal components of eukaryotic
cells in more detail.

Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bounded
organelles that carry out specialized functions.

micrograph (6) of a plant cell. Most mature plant cells
contain large central vacuoles which occupy a major portion
of the internal volume of the cell (14,000).
