FIGURE 41.33

ABC model for floral organ
specification.

Letters labeling whorls indicate
which gene classes are active.
When A function is lost (-4), C
expands to the first and second
whorls. When B function is lost
(-B), both outer two whorls have
just A function, and both inner
two whorls have just C function;
none of the whorls have dual
gene function. When C function
is lost (-C), A expands into the
inner two whorls. These new
combinations of gene expression
patterns alter which floral
structures form in each whorl.
(Model proposed by Coen and
Meyerowitz, 1991.)
