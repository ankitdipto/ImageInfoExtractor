553 Take a tour of a eukaryotic cell

The Nucleus: Information Center
for the Cell

The largest and most easily seen organelle within a eukary-
otic cell is the nucleus (Latin, for kernel or nut), first
described by the English botanist Robert Brown in 1831.
Nuclei are roughly spherical in shape and, in animal cells,
they are typically located in the central region of the cell
(figure 5.10). In some cells, a network of fine cytoplasmic

filaments seems to cradle the nucleus in this position. The
nucleus is the repository of the genetic information that
directs all of the activities of a living eukaryotic cell. Most
eukaryotic cells possess a single nucleus, although the cells
of fungi and some other groups may have several to many
nuclei. Mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) lose their
nuclei when they mature. Many nuclei exhibit a dark-
staining zone called the nucleolus, which is a region where
intensive synthesis of ribosomal RNA is taking place.

The nucleus. (a) The nucleus is composed of a double membrane, called a nuclear envelope, enclosing a fluid-filled interior containing
the chromosomes. In cross-section, the individual nuclear pores are seen to extend through the two membrane layers of the envelope; the
dark material within the pore is protein, which acts to control access through the pore. (J) A freeze-fracture scanning electron micrograph
