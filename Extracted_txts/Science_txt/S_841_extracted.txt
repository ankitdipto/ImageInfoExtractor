Rise of the Flowering Plants

Most of the plants we see daily are angiosperms. The
250,000 species of flowering plants range in size from al-
most microscopic herbs to giant Excalyptus trees, and their

Ginkgo) are also in this phylum. This chapter focuses on re-
production in angiosperms (figure 42.2) because of their
tremendous success and many uses by humans. Virtually all

FERTILIZATION

Angiosperm life cycle. Eggs form within the embryo sac inside the ovules, which, in turn, are enclosed in the carpels. The pollen grains,
meanwhile, are formed within the sporangia of the anthers and are shed. Fertilization is a double process. A sperm and an egg come
together, producing a zygote; at the same time, another sperm fuses with the polar nuclei to produce the endosperm. The endosperm is
the tissue, unique to angiosperms, that nourishes the embryo and young plant.
