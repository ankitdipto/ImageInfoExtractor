FIGURE 43.3

Evolutionary history of wheat. Domestic wheat arose in southwestern Asia in the hilly country of what is now Iraq. In this region, there
is a rich assembly of grasses of the genus Triticum. Domestic wheat (T. aestivum) is a polyploid species of Triticum that arose through two
so-called “allopolyploid” events. (1) Two different diploid species, AA and BB, hybridized to form an AB polyploid; the species were so
different that A and B chromosomes could not pair in meiosis, so the AB polyploid was sterile. However, in some plants the chromosome
number spontaneously doubled due to a failure of chromosomes to separate in meiosis, producing a fertile tetraploid species AABB. This
wheat is used in the production of pasta. (2) In a similar fashion, the tetraploid species AABB hybridized with another diploid species CC to

 

produce the hexaploid 7. aestivum, AABBCC. This bread wheat is commonly used throughout the world.
