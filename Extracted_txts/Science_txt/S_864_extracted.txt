Genomic alignment
(segment rearrangement)

 

 

Grain genomes are rearrangements of similar chromosome segments. Shades of the same color represent pieces of DNA that are

conserved among the different species but have been rearranged. By splitting the individual chromosomes of major grass species into
segments, and rearranging the segments, researchers have found that the genome components of rice, sugar cane, corn, and wheat are

highly conserved. This implies that the order of the segments in the ancestral grass genome has been rearranged by recombination as the
grasses have evolved. Data: G. Moore, K. M. Devos, Z. Wang, and M. D. Gale: “Grasses, line up and form a circle,” Current Biology 1995,
