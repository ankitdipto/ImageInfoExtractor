Types of Plant Tissue Cultures

Depending on the type of plant tissue used as the explant
and the composition of the growth medium, a variety of
different types of plant tissue cultures can be generated.
These different types of plant tissue cultures have applica-
tions both in basic plant research and commercial plant
production.

Callus Culture

Callus culture refers to the growth of unorganized masses of
plant cells in culture. To generate a callus culture, an ex-
plant, usually containing a region of meristematic cells, is
incubated on a growth medium containing certain plant
growth regulators such as auxin and cytokinin (figure

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

43.11). The cells grow from the explant and divide to form
an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. This unor-
ganized mass of growing cells is analogous to a plant
tumor. Cells can proliferate indefinitely if they are periodi-
cally transferred to fresh growth media. However, if the
callus cells are transferred to a growth medium containing
a different combination of plant growth regulators, the
cells can be directed to differentiate into roots and/or
shoots. This process of converting unorganized growth
into the production of shoots and roots is called organo-
genesis, and it represents one means by which a whole
plant can be regenerated from tissue culture cells. When a
plantlet produced by organogenesis is large enough, it can
be transferred to a large container with nutrients or soil
and grown to maturity.

on media containing new plant
growth regulators, differentiate

into plant parts. (d) After the
plantlet is large enough, it is grown,
to maturity in soil.
