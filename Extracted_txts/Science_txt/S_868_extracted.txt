Protoplast Isolation and Culture

Protoplasts are plant cells that have had their thick cell
walls removed by an enzymatic process, leaving behind a
plant cell enclosed only by the plasma membrane. Plant
protoplasts have been extremely useful in research on the
plant plasma membrane, a structure normally inaccessible
due to its close association with the cell wall. Within hours
of their isolation, plant protoplasts usually begin to resyn-
thesize cell walls, so this process has also been useful in
studies on cell wall production in plants. Plant protoplasts
are also more easily transformed with foreign DNA using
approaches such as electroporation (see the subsequent
section). In addition, protoplasts isolated from different

plants can be forced to fuse together to form a hybrid. If
they are regenerated into whole plants, these hybrids
formed from protoplast fusion can represent genetic com-
binations that would never occur in nature. Hence, proto-
plast fusion can provide an additional means of genetic en-
gineering, allowing beneficial traits from one plant to be
incorporated into another plant despite broad differences
between the species. When either single or fused proto-
plasts are transferred to a culture growth medium, cell wall
regeneration takes place, followed by cell division to form
a callus (figure 43.14). Once a callus is formed, whole
plants can be produced either by organogenesis or by so-
matic cell embryogenesis in culture.
