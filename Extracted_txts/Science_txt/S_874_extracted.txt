recovery of a plant containing foreign DNA introduced by the “particle gun” method for
plant cell transformation. A selectable marker, in this case a gene for resistance to
herbicide, aids in the identification and recovery of plants containing the DNA insert. (a)
Embryonic callus just prior to particle gun bombardment. (4) Following bombardment,
callus cells containing the foreign DNA are indicated by color from the gus gene used as a
tag or label on the foreign DNA. (c) Shoot formation in the transformed plants growing on
a selective medium. Here, the gene for herbicide resistance in the transformed plants
allows growth on the selective medium containing the herbicide. Nontransformed plants
do not contain the herbicide resistance gene and do not grow well. (d) Production of
plantlets from transformed plants growing on the selective medium. (¢) Comparison of
growth on the selection medium for transformed plants bearing the herbicide resistance
gene (lef?) and a nontransformed plant (right). (f) Mature transgenic plants resulting from
this process.
