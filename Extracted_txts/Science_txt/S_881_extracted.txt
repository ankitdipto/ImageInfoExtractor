878 Part XII Animal Diversity

 

 

Key Characteristics

Most successful of all animal phyla;
chitinous exoskeleton covering segmented
bodies with paired, jointed appendages;
many insect groups have wings

Soft-bodied coelomates whose bodies are
divided into three parts: head-foot, visceral
mass, and mantle; many have shells; almost
all possess a unique rasping tongue, called a
radula; 35,000 species are terrestrial

Segmented coelomates with a notochord;
possess a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal
slits, and a tail at some stage of life; in
vertebrates, the notochord is replaced
during development by the spinal column;
20,000 species are terrestrial

Solid, unsegmented, bilaterally symmetrical
worms; no body cavity; digestive cavity, if
present, has only one opening

Pseudocoelomate, unsegmented, bilaterally
symmetrical worms; tubular digestive tract
passing from mouth to anus; tiny; without
cilia; live in great numbers in soil and
aquatic sediments; some are important
animal parasites

Coelomate, serially segmented, bilaterally
symmetrical worms; complete digestive
tract; most have bristles called setae on
each segment that anchor them during
crawling
