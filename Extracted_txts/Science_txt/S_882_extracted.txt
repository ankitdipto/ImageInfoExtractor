Table 44.1 The Major Animal Phyla (continued)

Approximate
Number of
Key Characteristics Named Species

Soft, gelatinous, radially symmetrical 10,000
bodies whose digestive cavity has a single

opening; possess tentacles armed with

stinging cells called cnidocytes that shoot

sharp harpoons called nematocysts; almost

entirely marine

Deuterostomes with radially symmetrical 6,000
adult bodies; endoskeleton of calcium

plates; five-part body plan and unique

water vascular system with tube feet; able

to regenerate lost body parts; marine

Asymmetrical bodies without distinct 5,150
tissues or organs; saclike body consists of

two layers breached by many pores;

internal cavity lined with food-filtering

cells called choanocytes; most marine (150

species live in fresh water)

Microscopic, aquatic deuterostomes that 4,000
form branching colonies, possess circular

or U-shaped row of ciliated tentacles for

feeding called a lophophore that usually

protrudes through pores in a hard

exoskeleton; also called Ectoprocta

because the anus or proct is external to the

lophophore; marine or freshwater

Small, aquatic pseudocoelomates with a 2,000
crown of cilia around the mouth

resembling a wheel; almost all live in

fresh water
