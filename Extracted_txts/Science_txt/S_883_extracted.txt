880 Part XII Animal Diversity

 

 

Chaetognatha (arrow worms): coelomate
deuterostomes; bilaterally symmetrical;
large eyes (some) and powerful jaws

Hemichordata (acorn worms): marine
worms with dorsal and ventral nerve cords

Onychophora (velvet worms):
protostomes with a chitinous exoskeleton;
evolutionary relics

Pogonophora (tube worms): sessile deep-
sea worms with long tentacles; live within
chitinous tubes attached to the ocean floor

Nemertea (ribbon worms): acoelomate,
bilaterally symmetrical marine worms with
long extendable proboscis

Like bryozoans, possess a lophophore, but
within two clamlike shells; more than
30,000 species known as fossils

Gelatinous, almost transparent, often
bioluminescent marine animals; eight
bands of cilia; largest animals that use
cilia for locomotion; complete digestive
tract with anal pore

Lophophorate tube worms; often live in
dense populations; unique U-shaped gut,
instead of the straight digestive tube of
other tube worms

â€˜Tiny, bilaterally symmetrical, marine
pseudocoelomates that live in spaces
between grains of sand; mouthparts include
a unique flexible tube; a recently discovered
animal phylum (1983)
