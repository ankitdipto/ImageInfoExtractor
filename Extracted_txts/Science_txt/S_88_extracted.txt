FIGURE 5.16
How proteins are transported within
the cell. Proteins are manufactured at the
ribosome and then released into the internal
compartments of the rough ER. If the
newly synthesized proteins are to be used at
a distant location in or outside of the cell,
they are transported within vesicles that bud
off the rough ER and travel to the cis face,

or receiving end, of the Golgi apparatus.
There they are modified and packaged into
secretory vesicles. The secretory vesicles
then migrate from the trans face, or
discharging end, of the Golgi apparatus to
other locations in the cell, or they fuse with
the cell membrane, releasing their contents
to the external cellular environment.
