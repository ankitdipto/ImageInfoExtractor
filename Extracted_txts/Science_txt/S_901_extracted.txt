* Animals are heterotrophic, multicellular, and usually
have the ability to move. Almost all animals
reproduce sexually. Animal cells lack rigid cell walls
and digest their food internally.

¢ The kingdom Animalia is divided into two
subkingdoms: Parazoa, which includes only the
asymmetrical phylum Porifera, and Eumetazoa,
characterized by body symmetry.

1, What are the characteristics
that distinguish animals from
other living organisms?

2. What are the two
subkingdoms of animals? How
do they differ in terms of
symmetry and body
organization?

44.2 The simplest animals are not bilaterally symmetrical.

* The sponges (phylum Porifera) are characterized by
specialized, flagellated cells called choanocytes. They
do not possess tissues or organs, and most species lack
symmetry in their body organization.

* Cnidarians (phylum Cnidaria) are predominantly
marine animals with unique stinging cells called
cnidocytes, each of which contains a specialized
harpoonlike apparatus, or nematocyst.

3. From what kind of ancestor
did sponges probably evolve?
4, What are the specialized

cells used by a sponge to capture
food?

5. What are the two ways
sponges reproduce? What do
larval sponges look like?

6. What is a planula?

44.3, Acoelomates are solid worms that lack a body cavity.

* Sponges
* Radical Phyla

¢ Acoelomates lack an internal cavity, except for the
digestive system, and are the simplest animals that
have organs.

¢ The most prominent phylum of acoclomates,
Platyhelminthes, includes the free-living flatworms
and the parasitic flukes and tapeworms.

* Ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea) are similar to
free-living flatworms, but have a complete digestive
system and a circulatory system in which the blood
flows in vessels.

44.4 Pseudocoelomates have a simple body cavity.

7. What body plan do members
of the phylum Platyhelminthes
possess? Are these animals
parasitic or free-living? How do
they move from place to place?

8. How are tapeworms
different from flukes? How do
tapeworms reproduce?

(2) * Bilateral Acoelomates

Parasitic Flatworms

 

* Pseudocoelomates, exemplified by the nematodes
(phylum Nematoda), have a body cavity that develops
between the mesoderm and the endoderm.

* Rotifers (phylum Rotifera), or wheel animals, are very
small freshwater pseudococlomates.

9. Why are nematodes
structurally unique in the animal
world?

10. How do rotifers capture
food?

44.5 The coming revolution in animal taxonomy will likely alter

traditional phylogenies.

(2) * Pseudocoelomates

 

* Molecular data are suggesting animal phylogenies
that are in considerable disagreement with traditional
phylogenies.
