Ectoprocts (phylum Ectoprocta). (@) A small portion of a colony of the freshwater ectoproct, Plumatella (phylum Ectoprocta),
which grows on the underside of rocks. The individual at the left has a fully extended lophophore, the structure characteristic of
the three lophophorate phyla. The tiny individuals of Plumatella disappear into their shells when disturbed. (b) Plumatella repens, a

freshwater bryozoan.

Phylum Brachiopoda: The
Brachiopods

Brachiopods, or lamp shells, superfi-
cially resemble clams, with two calci-
fied shells (figure 45.18). Many
species attach to rocks or sand by a
stalk that protrudes through an open-
ing in one shell. The lophophore lies
within the shell and functions when
the brachiopod’s shells are opened
slightly. Although a little more than
300 species of brachiopods (phylum
Brachiopoda) exist today, more than
30,000 species of this phylum are
known as fossils. Because brachiopods
were common in the earth’s oceans
for millions of years and because their
shells fossilize readily, they are often
used as index fossils to define a partic-
ular time period or sediment type.
Brachiopods develop as deutero-
stomes and show radial cleavage.

The three phyla of lophophorates
probably share a common
ancestor, and they show a mixture
of protostome and deuterostome
characteristics.
