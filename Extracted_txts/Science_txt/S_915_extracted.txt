¢ Mollusks contain a true body cavity, or coclom,
within the embryonic mesoderm and were among the
first coelomate animals.

¢ The mollusks constitute the second largest phylum of
animals in terms of named species. Their body plan
consists of distinct parts: a head, a visceral mass, and a
foot.

© Of the seven classes of mollusks, the gastropods
(snails and slugs), bivalves (clams and scallops), and
cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and nautilus), are
best known.

* Gastropods typically live in a hard shell. During
development, one side of the embryo grows more
rapidly than the other, producing a characteristic
twisting of the visceral mass.

¢ Members of the class Bivalvia have two shells hinged
together dorsally and a wedge-shaped foot. They lack
distinct heads and radulas. Most bivalves are filter-
feeders.

* Octopuses and other cephalopods are efficient and
often large predators. They possess well-developed
brains and are the most intelligent invertebrates.

45.2 Annelids were the first segmented animals.

1. What is the basic body plan of
a mollusk? Where is the mantle
located? Why is it important in
the mollusks? What occurs in
the mantle cavity of aquatic
mollusks?

2. What isa radula? Do all
classes of mollusks possess this
structure? How is it used in
different types of mollusks?

3. How does the mollusk
excretory structure work? Why
is it better than the flame cells of
acoelomates?

4, What is a trochophore? What
is a veliger?

5. Do bivalves generally disperse
as larvae or adults? Explain.

¢ Segmentation is a characteristic seen only in
coelomate animals at the annelid evolutionary level
and above. Segmentation, or the repetition of body
regions, greatly facilitates the development of
specialized regions of the body.

* Annelids are worms with bodies composed of
numerous similar segments, each with its own
circulatory, excretory, and neural elements, and array
of setae. There are three classes of annelids, the
largely marine Polychaeta, the largely terrestrial
Oligochaeta, and the largely freshwater Hirudinea.

45.3 Lophophorates appear to be a transitional group.

6. What evolutionary advantages
does segmentation confer upon
an organism?

7, What are annelid setae? What
function do they serve? What
are parapodia? What class of
annelids possess them?

8. How do earthworms obtain
their nutrients? What sensory
structures do earthworms
possess? How do these animals
reproduce?

* The lophophorates consist of three phyla of marine
animals—Phoronida, Ectoprocta, and Brachiopoda—
characterized by a circular or U-shaped ridge, the
lophophore, around the mouth.

* Some lophophorates have characteristics like
protostomes, others like deuterostomes. All are
characterized by a lophophore and are thought to
share a common ancestor.
