appeared: the division of tissues into
three primary types (endoderm,
mesoderm, and ectoderm), bilateral
symmetry, a coclom, and segmenta-
tion. With arthropods, two more in-
novations arose—the development of
jointed appendages and an exoskeleton.
Jointed appendages and an exoskele-
ton have allowed arthropods (phy-
lum Arthropoda) to become the most
diverse phylum.

Jointed Appendages

The name “arthropod” comes from
two Greek words, arthros, “jointed,”
and podes, “feet.” All arthropods have
jointed appendages. The numbers of
these appendages are reduced in the
more advanced members of the phy-
lum. Individual appendages may be
modified into antennae, mouthparts
of various kinds, or legs. Some ap-
pendages, such as the wings of certain
insects, are not homologous to the
other appendages; insect wings
evolved separately.

To gain some idea of the impor-
tance of jointed appendages, imagine
yourself without them—no hips,
knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows,
wrists, or knuckles. Without jointed
appendages, you could not walk or
grasp any object. Arthropods use
jointed appendages such as legs for

component of plants, and shares
similar properties of toughness and
flexibility. Together, the chitin and
protein provide an external covering
that is both very strong and capable
of flexing in response to the contrac-
tion of muscles attached to it. In

most crustaceans, the exoskeleton is
made even tougher, although less
flexible, with deposits of calcium
salts. However, there is a limitation.
The exoskeleton must be much
thicker to bear the pull of the mus-
cles in large insects than in small
ones. That is why you don’t see bee-
tles as big as birds, or crabs the size
of a cow—the exoskeleton would be
so thick the animal couldn’t move its
great weight. Because this size limi-
tation is inherent in the body design
of arthropods, there are no large
arthropods—few are larger than
your thumb.

The Arthropods

Arthropods, especially the largest
class—insects—are by far the most
successful of all animals. Well over
1,000,000 species—about two-thirds
of all the named species on earth—
are members of this phylum (figure
46.2). One scientist recently esti-
mated, based on the number and di-
versity of insects in tropical forests,
that there might be as many as 30
million species in this one class
alone. About 200 million insects are
alive at any one time for each
human! Insects and other arthro-
pods (figure 46.3) abound in every

walking, antennae to sense their envi-
ronment, and mouthparts for feeding.

Arthropods are a successful group.
About two-thirds of all named species are
arthropods. About 80% of all arthropods
are insects, and about half of the named

habitat on the planet, but they espe-
cially dominate the land, along with
flowering plants and vertebrates.

Exoskeleton

The arthropod body plan has a sec-

ond major innovation: a rigid external skeleton, or ex-
oskeleton, made of chitin and protein. In any animal, the
skeleton functions to provide places for muscle attach-
ment. In arthropods, the muscles attach to the interior
surface of their hard exoskeleton, which also protects the
animal from predators and impedes water loss. Chitin is
chemically similar to cellulose, the dominant structural

species of insects are beetles.

The majority of arthropod species
consist of small animals, mostly about
a millimeter in length. Members of
the phylum range in adult size from about 80 micrometers
long (some parasitic mites) to 3.6 meters across (a gigantic
crab found in the sea off Japan

Arthropods, especially insects, are of enormous eco-
nomic importance and affect all aspects of human life.
They compete with humans for food of every kind, play a
key role in the pollination of certain crops, and cause bil-
