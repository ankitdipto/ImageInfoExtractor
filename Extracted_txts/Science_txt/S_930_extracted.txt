Class Insecta: The Insects

The insects, class Insecta, are by far the largest group of or-
ganisms on earth, whether measured in terms of numbers
of species or numbers of individuals. Insects live in every
conceivable habitat on land and in fresh water, and a few
have even invaded the sea. More than half of all the named
animal species are insects, and the actual proportion is
doubtless much higher because millions of additional forms
await detection, classification, and naming. Approximately
90,000 described species occur in the United States and
Canada, and the actual number of species in this area prob-
ably approaches 125,000. A hectare of lowland tropical for-
est is estimated to be inhabited by as many as 41,000
species of insects, and many suburban gardens may have
1500 or more species. It has been estimated that approxi-
mately a billion billion (10!) individual insects are alive at
any one time. A glimpse at the enormous diversity of in-
sects is presented in figure 46.24 and later in table 46.2. @

Insect diversity. (2) Luna moth, Actias luna. Luna moths and their relatives are among the most spectacular insects (order Lepidoptera).
( Soldier fly, Precticus rrivittatus (order Diptera). (c) Boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis. Weevils are one of the largest groups of beetles
(order Coleoptera). (d) A thorn-shaped leafhopper, Umbonica crassicornis (order Hemiptera). (e) Copulating grasshoppers (order
Orthoptera). (f Termite, Macrotermes bellicosus (order Isoptera). The large, sausage-shaped individual is a queen, specialized for laying
eggs; most of the smaller individuals around the queen are nonreproductive workers, but the larger individual at the lower left is a
reproductive male.
