FIGURE 47.4

The evolution of deuterostome development and an endoskeleton. Echinoderms, such as sea stars (phylum Echinodermata), are
coelomates with a deuterostome pattern of development. A delicate skin stretches over an endoskeleton made of calcium-rich plates, often

fused into a continuous, tough, spiny layer.
