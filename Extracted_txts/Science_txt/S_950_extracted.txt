 

PHYLUM CHORDATA: Notochord

 

Ina lancelet, the simplest chordate, the
flexible notochord persists throughout

life and aids swimming by giving muscles
something to pull against. In the lancelet

these muscles form a series of discrete

blocks that can easily be seen. More
advanced chordates have jointed appendages.

FIGURE 48.4

Evolution of a notochord. Vertebrates, tunicates, and lancelets are chordates (phylum Chordata), coelomate animals with a flexible rod,
the notochord, that provides resistance to muscle contraction and permits rapid lateral body movements. Chordates also possess
pharyngeal slits (reflecting their aquatic ancestry and present habitat in some) and a hollow dorsal nerve cord. In vertebrates, the
notochord is replaced during embryonic development by the vertebral column.

 

A number of other characteristics also distinguish the powers of locomotion that characterize the members of
chordates fundamentally from other animals. Chordatesâ€™ this group.

Most chordates have an internal skeleton against which
the muscles work. Either this internal skeleton or the no-
