Evolution of the fishes. The evolutionary relationships among the different groups of fishes as well as between fishes and amphibians is
shown. The spiny and armored fishes that dominated the early seas are now extinct.

Characteristics of Fishes

From whale sharks that are 18 meters long to tiny cich-
lids no larger than your fingernail, fishes vary consider-
ably in size, shape, color, and appearance. Some live in
freezing Arctic seas, others in warm freshwater lakes, and
still others spend a lot of time out of water entirely.
However varied, all fishes have important characteristics
in common:

1. Gills. Fishes are water-dwelling creatures and must
extract oxygen dissolved in the water around them.
They do this by directing a flow of water through
their mouths and across their gills. The gills are com-
posed of fine filaments of tissue that are rich in blood

2. Vertebral column. All fishes have an internal
skeleton with a spine surrounding the dorsal nerve
cord, although it may not necessarily be made of
bone. The brain is fully encased within a protective
box, the skull or cranium, made of bone or cartilage.

3. Single-loop blood circulation. Blood is pumped
from the heart to the gills. From the gills, the oxy-
genated blood passes to the rest of the body, then re-
turns to the heart. The heart is a muscular tube-pump
made of four chambers that contract in sequence.

4, Nutritional deficiencies. Fishes are unable to syn-
thesize the aromatic amino acids and must consume
them in their diet. This inability has been inherited
by all their vertebrate descendants.

 

vessels. They are located at the back of the pharynx
and are supported by arches of cartilage. Blood moves
through the gills in the opposite direction to the flow
of water in order to maximize the efficiency of oxygen
absorption.

Fishes were the first vertebrates to make their
appearance, and today they are still the largest
vertebrate class. They are the vertebrate group from
which all other vertebrates evolved.
