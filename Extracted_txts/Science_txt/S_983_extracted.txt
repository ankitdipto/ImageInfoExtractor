48.1 Attaching muscles to an internal framework greatly improves movement.

 

© The chordates are characterized by a dorsal nerve
cord and by the presence, at least early in
development, of a notochord, pharyngeal slits, and a
postanal tail. In vertebrates, a bony endoskeleton
provides attachment sites for skeletal muscle.

48.2 Nonvertebrate chordates have a notochord but no backbone.

1. What are the four primary
characteristics of the chordates?

* Chordates

 

¢ Tunicates and the lancelets seem to represent ancient
evolutionary Chordate offshoots.

2. What are the three subphyla
of the chordates? Give an
example of each.

48.3. The vertebrates have an interior framework of bone.

 

¢ Vertebrates differ from other chordates in that they
possess a vertebral column, a distinct and well-
differentiated head, and a bony skeleton.

3. What is the relationship
between the notochord and the
vertebral column in vertebrates?

Vertebrates

and 7

48.4 The evolution of vertebrates involves successful invasions of sea, land, and air.

 

* Members of the group Agnatha differ from other
vertebrates because they lack jaws.

© Jawed fishes constitute more than half of the
estimated 42,500 species of vertebrates and are
dominant in fresh and salt water everywhere.

¢ The first land vertebrates were the amphibians.
Amphibians are dependent on water and lay their
eggs in moist places.

* Reptiles were the first vertebrates fully adapted to
terrestrial habitats. Scales and amniotic eggs
represented significant adaptations to the dry
conditions on land.

* Birds and mammals were derived from reptiles and
are now among the dominant groups of animals on
land. The members of these two classes have
independently become endothermic, capable of
regulating their own body temperatures; all other
living animals are ectothermic, their temperatures set
by external conditions.

© The living mammals are divided into three major
groups: (1) the monotremes, or egg-laying mammals,
consisting only of the echidnas and the duck-billed
platypus; (2) the marsupials, in which the young are
born at a very early stage of development and
complete their development in a pouch; and (3) the
placental mammals, which lack pouches and suckle
their young.

4, What is one advantage of
possessing jaws? From what
existing structures did jaws

evolve?

5. What is the primary
disadvantage of a bony skeleton
compared to one made of

cartilage?

6. What is the lateral line
system in fishes? How does it

function?

7. The successful invasion of
land by amphibians involved five
major innovations. What were
they, and why was each

important?

8. How does the embryo obtain
nutrients and excrete wastes

structure are feathers derived?
