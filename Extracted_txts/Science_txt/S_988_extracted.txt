Organs and Organ Systems

Organs are body structures composed
of several different tissues that form a
structural and functional unit (figure
49.4). One example is the heart, which
contains cardiac muscle, connective
tissue, and epithelial tissue and is
laced with nerve tissue that helps reg-
ulate the heartbeat. An organ system
is a group of organs that function to-
gether to carry out the major activities
of the body. For example, the diges-
tive system is composed of the diges-
tive tract, liver, gallbladder, and pan-
creas. These organs cooperate in the
digestion of food and the absorption
of digestion products into the body.
The vertebrate body contains 11 prin-
cipal organ systems (table 49.1 and
figure 49.5).

The bodies of humans and other
mammals contain a cavity divided
by the diaphragm into thoracic and
abdominal cavities. The body’s cells
are organized into tissues, which
are, in turn, organized into organs
and organ systems.

carry out a function for the body are called an organ system. The circulatory system is an

System Functions

Circulatory Transports cells, respiratory gases, and
chemical compounds throughout the body

Digestive Captures soluble nutrients from ingested
food

Endocrine Coordinates and integrates the activities of
the body

Integumentary Covers and protects the body

Lymphatic/ Vessels transport extracellular fluid and

Immune fat to circulatory system; lymph nodes
and lymphatic organs provide defenses to
microbial infection and cancer

Muscular Produces body movement

Nervous Receives stimuli, integrates information,
and directs the body

Reproductive Carries out reproduction

Respiratory Captures oxygen and exchanges gases

Skeletal Protects the body and provides support for
locomotion and movement

Urinary Removes metabolic wastes from the

bloodstream

Components
