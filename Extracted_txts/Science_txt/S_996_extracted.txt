contains about 300 million molecules
of the iron-containing protein hemoglobin,
the principal carrier of oxygen in verte-
brates and in many other groups of
animals.

There are several types of leukocytes,
but together they are only one-thou-
sandth as numerous as erythrocytes.
Unlike mammalian erythrocytes, leuko-
cytes have nuclei and mitochondria but
lack the red pigment hemoglobin.
These cells are therefore hard to see
under a microscope without special
staining. The names neutrophils,
eosinophils, and basophils distinguish
three types of leukocytes on the basis of
their staining properties; other leuko-
cytes include /ymphocytes and monocytes.
These different types of leukocytes play
critical roles in immunity, as will be de-
scribed in chapter 57.

The blood plasma is the “commons”
of the body; it (or a derivative of it)
travels to and from every cell in the
body. As the plasma circulates, it car-
ries nourishment, waste products, heat,
and regulatory molecules. Practically
every substance used by cells, including
sugars, lipids, and amino acids, is deliv-
ered by the plasma to the body cells.
Waste products from the cells are car-
ried by the plasma to the kidneys, liver,
and lungs or gills for disposal, and reg-
ulatory molecules (hormones) that en-
docrine gland cells secrete are carried
by the plasma to regulate the activities
of most organs of the body. The plasma
also contains sodium, calcium, and
other inorganic ions that all cells need,
as well as numerous proteins. Plasma
proteins include fibrinogen, produced by
the liver, which helps blood to clot; a-
bumin, also produced by the liver,
which exerts an osmotic force needed
for fluid balance; and antibodies pro-
duced by lymphocytes and needed for

immunity.

Special connective tissues each have
a unique extracellular matrix

between cells. The matrix of
cartilage is composed of organic
material, whereas that of bone is
impregnated with calcium phosphate
crystals. The matrix of blood is fluid,
the plasma.

The structure of bone. A photomicrograph (a) and diagram (b) of the structure of bone,
showing the bone cells, or osteocytes, within their lacunae (cavities) in the bone matrix.
Though the bone matrix is calcified, the osteocytes remain alive because they can be
nourished by blood vessels in the central cavity. Nourishment is carried between the
osteocytes through a network of cytoplasmic processes extending through tiny canals, or
canaliculi.

White and red
blood cells
(500x). White
blood cells, or
leukocytes, are
roughly spherical
and have irregular
surfaces with
numerous
extending pili.
Red blood cells,
or erythrocytes,
are flattened
spheres, typically
with a depressed
center, forming
biconcave discs.
