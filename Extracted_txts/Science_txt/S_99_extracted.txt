The cell is the smallest unit of life. All living things
are made of cells.

The cell is composed of a nuclear region, which holds
the hereditary apparatus, enclosed within the
cytoplasm.

In all cells, the cytoplasm is bounded by a membrane
composed of phospholipid and protein.

1, What are the three principles
of the cell theory?

2. How does the surface area-
to-volume ratio of cells limit the
size that cells can attain?

5.2 Eukaryotic cells are far more complex than bacterial cells.

* Surface to Volume

 

Bacteria, which have prokaryotic cell structure, do
not have membrane-bounded organelles within their
cells. Their DNA molecule is circular.

The eukaryotic cell is larger and more complex, with
many internal compartments.

3. How are prokaryotes
different from eukaryotes in
terms of their cell walls, interior
organization, and flagella?

A eukaryotic cell is organized into three principal zones:
the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the plasma membrane.
Located in the cytoplasm are numerous organelles,
which perform specific functions for the cell.

Many of these organelles, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus (which gives rise to
lysosomes), and nucleus, are part of a complex
endomembrane system.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are part of the energy-
processing system of the cell.

The cytoskeleton encompasses a variety of fibrous
proteins that provide structural support and perform
other functions for the cell.

Many eukaryotic cells possess flagella or cilia having a
9 +2 arrangement of microtubules; sliding of the
microtubules past one another bends these cellular
appendages.

Cells transport materials long distances within the
cytoplasm by packaging them into vesicles that are
pulled by motor proteins along microtubule tracks.

4, What is the endoplasmic
reticulum? What is its function?
How does rough ER differ from
smooth ER?

5. What is the function of the
Golgi apparatus? How do the
substances released by the Golgi
apparatus make their way to
other locations in the cell?

6. What types of eukaryotic
cells contain mitochondria?
What function do mitochondria
perform?

7. What unique metabolic
activity occurs in chloroplasts?

8. What cellular functions do
centrioles participate in?

9, What kinds of cytoskeleton
fibers are stable and which are
changeable?

10. How do cilia compare with
eukaryotic flagella?

5.4 Symbiosis played a key role in the origin of some eukaryotic organelles.

102 Part II Biology of the Cell

Present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts probably
evolved as a consequence of early endosymbiosis: the
ancestor of the eukaryotic cell engulfed a bacterium,
and the bacterium continued to function within the
host cell.

 

11. What is the endosymbiont
theory? What is the evidence
supporting this theory?
