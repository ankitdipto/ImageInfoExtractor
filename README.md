# ImageInfoExtractor
An *AI-powered* software that processes images to filter out scanned documents from normal pictures and subsequently classifies those documents into their respective domains. The project primarily consists of 3 models connected end to end starting with the **OCR Engine** followed by an **Image Detector-cum-Processor** and lastly the deep neural **Document Classifier**. The purpose of this project is to automate the management of images containing natural ones and scanned documents, that pile up day to day in our laptop or mobile storage.
